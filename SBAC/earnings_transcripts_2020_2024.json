Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations, our statements are as of today, February 22, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had a very strong end to the year with fourth quarter results near the high end of our outlook for all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $493 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $492.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $3.5 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the fourth quarter. They were, again, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $17.7 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.4% on a net basis, including 2.3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter, was at the highest levels of the year. We saw continued increased activity levels with T-Mobile during the quarter, and our domestic application backlog continues to grow. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 88% of our domestic bookings, with 12% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nMark DeRussy : Thanks, Brendan. We ended the year with $11.2 billion of total debt and $10.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.1 time. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA-to-net cash interest expense was 4.4 times. After year-end, on January 29, 2021, the company issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2029. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.125% per year, and interest is due semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning in August 1, 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fully redeem all of the outstanding 4% senior notes to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption to repay the amounts outstanding at the time under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have $630 million outstanding under our revolver. And pro forma for the January unsecured notes issuance, the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.7 years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $480 million or an average price of $290.89 per share. Subsequent to year-end, we have repurchased 549,000 shares for $144 million or an average price of $262.16 per share. All the shares repurchased were retired.\nJeff Stoops : Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a strong finish to 2020 with solid financial and operating results. The fourth quarter was our best quarter of the year in terms of organic leasing activity and services results, and we added a number of high-quality assets to our portfolio. We produced $2.49 of AFFO per share, or $0.01 short of an annualized rate of $10 per share. Our AFFO per share for the quarter represented material growth over the prior year period and demonstrates the value creation capability of this business. We also continued to invest in our company through material share repurchases, buying back 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and we did not slow down as we moved into 2021. Since year-end, we have signed up and closed on our large and exciting transaction with PG&E, repurchased an additional 0.5 million shares of our stock and signed up a master lease agreement with DISH. All of these activities will have long-lasting positive implications for SBA. We've demonstrated our ability over the years to find specific targeted opportunities where we can add assets at accretive prices and bring our expertise to bear in extracting and maximizing value. We're particularly pleased with the PG&E transaction. We've added a large number of high-quality, exclusive locations in Northern California to our portfolio at what we believe is an attractive price. We believe our experience and operational expertise will allow us to maximize the potential for wireless use of these assets for the benefit of both our wireless carrier customers and PG&E. With regard to our domestic leasing business, our customers are all turning their attention toward their 5G network investment plans. The significant investment in the current C-Band auction is evidence of the critical role that mid-band spectrum will play in the deployment of next-generation networks. And as a result, the importance of macro tower sites in the next wave of network investment. We believe it has been well settled that the primary use of C-Band spectrum will be on macro sites outside of urban markets.\nOperator: Okay. . Our first question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRichard Prentiss: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.\nJeff Stoops: Hey, Rick.\nRichard Prentiss: Hey, a couple of questions. Jeff, obviously, the PG&E transaction is a pretty major transaction. Can you walk us through a little bit about 2021 guidance? And how much revenue there is associated with the tower cash flow? I assume not much operating expenses at their sites. But then also take us down maybe to EBITDA because I'd also expect not a lot of below the line costs.\nJeff Stoops : You're right on both counts. Brendan?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yes. Rick, so if you look at our bridge for 2020 and 2021, we've got about $40 million of non-organic revenue coming in. I would say, the majority of that, $35-ish million of that, is coming from PG&E.\nRichard Prentiss : Okay. And how about on the EBITDA area? Is it in that kind of $30 million, $35 million range on?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yes. It's within a couple of million dollars, because there's no -- the key thing is obviously the ground rent. They own the majority of land or have rights to it, so there's really no ground rent expense at all. So the margins are extremely high on this. So the vast majority of the revenue drops through to the bottom line.\nRichard Prentiss : Makes sense. And then, Jeff, obviously, one of the big debates out there in the marketplace right now is the growth rates of -- in the U.S., same tower revenue, net organic cash, as we call it. Given the law of large numbers, churn, long-term, not to give you a $10 number like you had years ago, but can we get back into the mid-single digits? What's your view as kind of where the sustainable kind of long-term growth rate is in the U.S. side on a net organic cash basis?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. I do think we can get -- I don't know if we can get to double digits, but I do think we can get to upper single digits. I think what's happening this year is, if you think about it, you got a couple major carriers who are rumored to be heavy into the C-Band auctions, which means that there's going to be a lot to do. And if there's going to be a lot to do, you know there's going to be a lot to do, and you might push off what you can do today until tomorrow. And then you have one carrier in the name of DISH, who's already told you very clearly when they're going to start doing things, it kind of makes -- I think it's pretty clear as to the pace of things and the timing of things in 2021, but then it sets up for a very, very attractive 2022, particularly over 2021 comparable.\nRichard Prentiss: Makes sense. And then how should we think about the churn impact? DISH also on their call today was talking about T-Mobile had given DISH notice that they would turn off the CDMA. I don't think they said VoLTE, but they said they would turn off the CDMA network January of 2022. How should we think about the T-Mobile-Sprint relationship you guys have? And what the churn outlook looks like?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Rick. So we've already -- I think we announced on our previous call that we've already received some non-renewal notifications from T-Mobile. And just to give you some numbers, for next year, 2021 being next year, that represents about $4 million to $5 million of the impact to our revenue loss. In addition to that, in our outlook, we expect, based on when leases come up and communications we've had already, that will probably be somewhere - an additional $3 million or so from them. As we look out over the future years, right at this point, we're basically measuring it based on where we have overlapping sites and what the timing is when those leases come up. That puts the majority of the terminations in terms of their financial impact for us in 2025 and 2026. We will see probably about 30% of the total exposure over the next three years.\nJeff Stoops : Yes. And obviously, we'll be well suited to talk to DISH about any of those sites that T-Mobile decides they no longer want.\nRichard Prentiss: Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Stay well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. Yes. I just wanted to get a sense of some of the organic U.S. growth drivers this year that you alluded to around C-Band and DISH. Anything that you're seeing kind of so far this year around application activity that gives you a sense of when the timing would be around rent commencement? And then if you don't mind also addressing some of the smaller potential drivers, U.S. cellular, cable as well in the context of C-Band? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops : Yes. We really have not included any C-Band revenue in our 2021 guidance -- leasing guidance and the same with DISH. Now there certainly are arguments and optimism that, that could change, and things could happen where we do realize that, but it's not in there today, Jon.\nJonathan Atkin : Okay. And then on Rick's question about the Sprint T-Mobile, on the keep sites project, are you getting any sense as you think about churn and the guidance that you gave, but any variability around where you're getting to get informed about the sites to get kept as part of that? How does that kind of play into your thinking? And where are they in that process?\nJeff Stoops : Well, we've received quite a bit of information already, which we've been able to share with you on our outlook. But we're not -- we don't know that we've received at all.\nJonathan Atkin: Right.\nJeff Stoops: But we've had -- I mean, based on the timing of notices and things, I would tell you that I think we have the lion's share of the information already at this point.\nJonathan Atkin: Okay.\nBrendan Cavanagh: As it relates to this year, as it relates to 2021.\nJeff Stoops: As it relates to 2021. Yes.\nJonathan Atkin : Got it. Any update on SBA Edge?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. We continue to have a number of opportunities that we're pursuing to actually move forward and tie. What we're focusing on, Jon, is the areas around the data centers to work on the direct ties between true mobile edge at the tower site type facilities, which have direct connections back, and we've got a number of different things that we're working on there. And we would just ask you to stay tuned there because we think there continues to be a lot of exciting opportunities and things that we can do there. But I think it's\u2026\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you very much.\nJeff Stoops: \u2026it will be not a material contributor to 2021.\nJonathan Atkin: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk : Hi, Jeff. On past calls, you and I have had these kind of dialogues about like timing of orders versus revenue and like how long it takes to execute. So just curious in terms of C-Band. Shouldn't you, by the end of the second quarter, have orders? If we -- if you should be able to get any type of revenue in calendar 2021, I mean, if not even by the end of this quarter. Can you just refresh our memory on the timing of that? Because the reason I ask, obviously, because Verizon is out there telling people, I think historically that, \"Oh, yes, we can get C-Band built really quickly.\" And I think we have to back up to those days and actually see orders that's like 9 months, maybe more from when they would be activated and generating revenue for you? And prefer not to talk about a customer, just you can submit AT&T or T-Mobile or whatever. You know what the question is.\nJeff Stoops : It's not quite 9 months. Well, we probably have, at the absolute minimum 4 but more likely 6.\nWalter Piecyk : Okay. So if we're to believe the ability to light up a C-Band market, then we should be hearing from tower companies, whether you or someone else C-Band orders by June 30, is that fair? Okay.\nJeff Stoops : .\nWalter Piecyk : Also DISH mentioned the substantial minimum lease agreement. Is there a time -- like how does that work? Is it meaning like they agree to X dollars in 2022? How does that work? Or is it just over the life, they're going to pay you X? Which is it?\nJeff Stoops : It is a number of leases. It is not -- it is -- if you could look at it as one because there are certain dollar parameters that we've agreed to per lease, but it is a minimum site.\nWalter Piecyk : Got it. So that doesn't give us any sense on timing. It's just like he told you, we'll put up X thousand sites at some point over the next Y years.\nJeff Stoops : Well, we do have some time breaks in there. So there are -- it's a little more defined than that. But -- so over the life of the contract, before all the commitments are ultimately due, but there -- it's not only until the end are they due. There are some due for a long time.\nWalter Piecyk : And then just last question. Have you seen -- another one of my favorite topics, have you seen any initial deployments of massive MIMO antennas? I think there was some issue in terms of ramping up production with certain spectrum bands. Maybe that has to wait for C-Band, I don't know.\nJeff Stoops : We've been seeing that for a while with T-Mobile-Sprint on the 2.5G.\nWalter Piecyk : Got it. So -- I'm sorry, I guess I should be more specific. I think there might have been issues in terms of the MIMO antennas having ported for C-Band, but I guess it's -- why would that be occurring until the auction is over. So I will reserve that question for a future quarter. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Stoops : Yes.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.\nNicholas Del Deo : So you guys noted that your leverage is going to be above your target post-PG&E, but trend down organically over the course of the year. Does that mean that any share repurchases or then activity are going to be somewhat restrained through year-end? Or would you be willing to stay above your target leverage for longer if the stock is attractively valued and you buy some more or if other M&A opportunities surface?\nJeff Stoops : Well, it means we don't have to rush, but we would like to be at the high end of the target or below by year-end. But that statement gives us quite a bit of flexibility.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We have, just to be clear, Nick, I mean, we have plenty of capacity to continue to do typical levels of M&A and buybacks and still be within our target leverage range at the end of the year.\nJeff Stoops : I think the key answer to your question is, are you going to rush to do it in 1 quarter? Or are you going to wait until the end of the year to preserve maximum flexibility? And the answer is the latter.\nNicholas Del Deo : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then related to the DISH deal, obviously, one of your peers has talked about getting more than their proportionate share of business from DISH by virtue of their deal. Do you feel like you're well positioned to get your fair share of new business? And do you feel like you were well served by waiting some extra time to sign the deal?\nJeff Stoops : Based on the firm commitment that we have, the answer is yes. So I guess the answer to your second question is yes.\nNicholas Del Deo : Okay. That's good to hear. Maybe one more if I could squeeze it in. Has T-Mobile's leasing activity been recovering in the way you had expected it would a quarter or 2 ago? Or has it come in a bit slower?\nJeff Stoops : No. I think T-Mobile is doing just as we thought. They're very busy, very active, very deliberate, very, very -- they're a force. There's -- it's all very busy, and we see a strong year ahead for them.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of David Barden, Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : I guess, first, Jeff, now that you've kind of done this PG&E deal, there's been a gulf between the tower sector and the utility sector for a long time that this deal seems to kind of cross. And I'm wondering if there's a new kind of total addressable market opportunity that you\u2019ve kind of on forward tier as a function of that. The second question, Brendan, would be from -- maybe 2 for you, Brendan, would be, first, on the international churn, is this the number around $10 million a year, that's the new normal that we should expect on a go-forward basis? And then with respect to the PG&E deal, specifically, relative to that 35, is that going to be run rating at 8 to 9 in the first quarter? Or does it kind of graduate up to that 35 over the course of the year?\nJeff Stoops : Yes, why don't you go first, then I'll wrap it up with the more philosophical.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Sure. Yes. Well, I'll take the last one first. On the PG&E piece, it does step up a little bit during the year, but it's relatively small, David. I would expect it to not be significant steps up. There are escalators that are built in, and we would expect a modest amount of new lease-up. Obviously, we just brought these sites into our portfolio. So there will be some step up, but it will be generally run rated at the same pace. Of course, the first quarter will obviously be materially lower than the other quarters as we only have it in our portfolio for half the quarter. But on a run rate basis, it will be very small step up throughout the year. On the international churn side, the $10 million is definitely not the new normal. There are some specific things that are driving that number up. I do expect it, though, to be elevated probably next year as well. It's hard for us to say exactly what the number will be because we are in the midst of discussions with the carriers, where there's been some consolidation as well as the other customer where we've had some work with them to try and help them through some issues that they have. So I do expect that there will be additional impact next year, but the exact amount remains to be seen. But eventually, we'll get through those issues, and I would not expect to be at that level long-term.\nJeff Stoops : Yes. In terms of whether this opens up a new source of relationships between tower companies and utilities, David, I mean, I think it remains to be seen. It's not the first. There have been a couple of other transactions between tower companies and utilities. They were not involving any of the publics, however, so this might be the third. And this one was fairly unique in particularly as to its geographic location, but we'll see. We've actually had more than a couple of inquiries. Utilities have very different primary considerations that they have to think about and it has to fit bearings, but we found certainly, in the case of PG&E that it did, and I'm sure that those characteristics could be met again. And because it's never the primary, and frankly, can't be the primary focus of a utility company to make tower leasing top of mind or the number 1 thing they think about, there's always going to be an element of improvement that can be an arbitrage there for the benefit of everyone. So we'll see. We'll see.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael : I just actually have 2 points of clarification and then just 1 quick question. First off, point of clarification, Jeff, when you're saying you think you're going to get back to high single-digit domestic growth...\nJeff Stoops : I said mid, but go ahead.\nColby Synesael : I was going to ask if you're speaking about gross or net? And then my next question just real quick. When you said you're expecting T-Mobile churn for 2021, I heard 4 and 5 and I heard 7 and 8. Are you saying you were previously thinking 4 to 5, and now it's 7 to 8? And then my last question, the 299 sites that you've already committed to acquire, can you give us some color on where those sites are?\nJeff Stoops : On the Sprint T-Mobile piece, it was $4 million to $5 million is the number based on what we've already specifically received notices on. The incremental $3 million is an estimate that we've included in our outlook in churn assumptions that we put forth in our bridge, for instance, that's not yet been specifically noted to us, but we are estimating based on what we see in terms of the timing when those leases come due. The 299 lease -- or sorry, sites that are under contract from an M&A standpoint, the vast majority of those are located internationally, but they're spread out. There are some in, I think, the biggest country is South Africa, but there's some throughout Latin America as well. And your first question is on the growth rates. Yes. I think the question was about net. And we're thinking -- we believe that there is an opportunity to see that go back up to mid-levels, above 5, I guess, you could consider more than mid, but we think there's opportunity with all the growth that's out there. The biggest challenge, frankly, on that, Colby, is really about the churn, the Sprint T-Mobile churn. I mean, if you figure that in, that's certainly going to weigh on it. But if you put that aside, there certainly is an opportunity from the growth set that's in front of us.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Actually, I thought Rick's question was gross so.\nColby Synesael : So mid-level is a tough 5% net long-term domestic, you think is a reasonable expectation?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. And obviously, higher gross.\nColby Synesael : Yes. And then just actually one real other quick one. You said that PG&E hasn't closed completely. What else is still left to close?\nJeff Stoops : There's a small number of sites. So the total purchase price is about $973 million. We've closed on $954 million of that, so the vast majority of it. There's some number of sites that have certain specific issues that have to be addressed, but we expect them to be cleaned up in the next 6 months, and those sites will just close later.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : So when we look at the expected leasing from the major wireless carriers, virtually all of the spectrum that they'll be deploying that they haven't used is at frequency ranges that's higher than what they have in their networks today. And so what that would imply is that their existing site grids are insufficient to fully utilize those bands. And so with that as context, that sort of leads to 2 questions. One, as you look out and expect that leasing activity is going to ramp, as some of these spectrum bands get deployed, you've been very amendment heavy for a while with your leasing. I'm wondering if you do expect or maybe even have visibility into that being more balanced between new colocations versus amendments? And then the second is, I'm wondering, do you think that perhaps the nation's power grid is insufficiently dense such that there might be an emerging opportunity to do to a step up here of development of U.S. towers because historically, I think that has actually been your highest return on investment?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. I think amendments will always play a big role, Brett, because they're the most efficient and I think economically beneficial for our customers. And then I think existing structures will get colocation because the existing regulatory regime tapers that. But yes, there'll be some more towers still. There's no question, not only because of the spectrum propagation, but because, I think on a perhaps totally unrelated reason, there's going to be a fair amount of emphasis on closing the digital divide and just bringing broadband to everyone, which is clearly going to require that some more towers get built.\nBrett Feldman : Got it. If I could ask a quick follow-up, just around the same concept of densification. We know your opinion around small cells, but I'm wondering if there's any other emerging areas in infrastructure, maybe rooftops, where the economics could potentially become more favorable as these mid-band spectrum ranges are being deployed versus historically?\nJeff Stoops : I think it has to depend on the facts and circumstances. I believe that wherever you can get a true tower, a macro site that always gives our customers the most bang for their buck, but I do believe you will see this spectrum used in conjunction with small cells as well in areas where you just don't get towers. It doesn't mean those areas aren't going to be served, they're going to be served by alternate architecture.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nAmir Rozwadowski : This is Amir for Phil. Brendan, can you help us by talking about the pace of activity in 1Q '21? And should we expect slower activity in 1Q than 4Q? And Jeff, can you talk about how much is built into this guidance for the announced this deal? Is that expected to be material this year?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yes, Amir, so our outlook for '21 does assume a pace of activity that is increasing throughout the year, so it's definitely a little bit slower is our assumption here at the beginning of the year, and it picks up in the latter half of the year. That's consistent with our comments we've been making around C-Band and the DISH MLA, all those things will certainly drive more leasing activity in the latter half of the year. But even then, the impact of that to our financial statements will be limited because of the timing of signing up new agreements to when they actually start to recognize revenue. So I don't -- it will step up, I believe, throughout the year, but I think you'll start to see the benefits of that increase next year or late this year.\nJeff Stoops : And in terms specifically of DISH, while we could see some leasing revenue, there's none really contemplated in the guidance and very little contemplated in the services revenue guidance. Although, again, depending on timing, it could be better.\nAmir Rozwadowski : And with Brazil, we've heard this business is slow, but this is lower activity than we kind of expected. Can you talk about the pace of activity over the last 6 months? And what you expect it to be going forward?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. Brazil has had a couple of issues that have been impacting it, the overhang of the Oi transaction, which is working itself through, which we think, long-term, will be favorable. For us, it looks like TIM will get most of those -- well, not most, but the predominant amount of those assets with Claro next, and then Telefonica the third or the last lease amount, which bodes well for us from an overlap perspective. And then obviously, they've had their issues with COVID. So as those things settle out, Brazil is actually expected to have quite a material jump in their GDP moving from 2020 to 2021. So as those things kind of play themselves out, yes, we do expect Brazil to get back to its best growing self.\nAmir Rozwadowski : And one final one, if I may, with PG&E recently through bankruptcy, what's kind of the protection can you guys have if that happens again?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. We've got pages and pages and legal fees and legal fees that we\u2019re addressing at that point. The structure of the deal, the regulatory posture of where we sit versus where PG&E sits well into this deal, I could spend quite a bit of time with you on that, but I could also just say we're covered.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow : I just wanted to follow-up on the PG&E acquisition. Obviously, the 700 sites you acquired and then the additional 28,000 you have the right to market. Just wondering kind of the tenants per tower in that portfolio? And then on that 28,000, how many do you really think realistically tenants per tower you think you can drive and colocatability of perhaps some of those sites in terms of growing that portfolio from where it's at today, that would be helpful.\nJeff Stoops : Yes. There are not many tenants per tower on the 28,000 today. I don't think they've ever frankly been marketed. The -- on the existing ones, I think I mentioned in my prepared comments that we have approximately 900 tenants, a little more than 900 tenants across those roughly 700 sites. So it's been a totally kind of carriers have had to seek out the appropriate PG&E folks to -- which is the way it works with a type of relationship, which is why we think we could bring additional value. And to be honest with you, I can't hazard a guess on the 28,000, but I can promise you it'll be something.\nEric Luebchow : Okay. That's fair. And then just one more for me. It sounded like you at least had some additional capacity, perhaps later in the year for either share repurchases or additional acquisitions. So kind of where you sit today, the stock, 20% or so down from where you were at last year. I mean, do you think potentially share repurchases versus acquisitions, how would you think about it? It seems like tower cash flow multiples continue to be greater than 30 times in many cases and your stock is trading well under that. So wondering how you kind of balance your thoughts on capital allocation, given those dynamics?\nJeff Stoops : Well, if you -- if we saw those type of dynamics as you described, that would bear in favor of stock repurchases if we saw more opportunities like PG&E, it would.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery.\nSimon Flannery : Just wanted to come back to Brazil. I think you'd made a comment about some important spectrum auctions in the international markets. Is -- Brazil has some coming up. What are the other ones that you're focused on? And then coming back to C-Band, given the bidding, there's concerns about the amount of leverage the carriers are taking on, do you think that might change any behavior either in how fast they can deploy C-Band or their kind of outsourcing strategies, et cetera?\nJeff Stoops : Canada has 3.5 gigahertz tentatively scheduled for June. South Africa has an entire suite of 5G spectrum tentatively scheduled for next quarter. Peru has a big one for later this first-half, Chile, Colombia and Brazil. In terms of the money being spent, Simon, I see that and I read that -- I have to assume that our customers know exactly what they're doing, I'm sure that they do. And for that spectrum to have value to them, it has to be deployed. I don't know exactly what the cost will change for them. But ultimately, it's going to have to get put out there. And that's kind of all we can work with. And whether it's 1 quarter, 2 quarters or 3 quarters difference, in the overall scheme of the value creation for us, it really doesn't matter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi : In terms of the PG&E deal, can you talk a little bit about the wireless contracts? How they compare to your portfolio, maybe in terms of the tenancy mix, the length of the contract? And if we should assume there could be some T-Mobile Sprint churn in there? And then a follow-up on the churn -- domestic churn this year, is the indication that you're getting from T-Mobile is mostly on the overlapping side, but is there also any coming from sites that are in close proximity?\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the tenant mix for PG&E, the vast majority, almost all of the revenue comes from the big 3 wireless carriers. There is some Sprint overlap, which we obviously included any exposure to that in our underwriting assumptions. It's not particularly material, where we have both T-Mobile and Sprint on the same site, and the average remaining term for those tenants is about 7 years. So there's quite an extensive time -- runway left on that.\nBatya Levi : Great. And the Sprint T-Mobile churn this year?\nJeff Stoops : All of those sites.\nBrendan Cavanagh: On those sites, for this year, we're not really expecting to see any Sprint T-Mobile churn this year. So our numbers that we gave you on our outlook don't include anything for PG&E.\nBatya Levi : I'm sorry, for your existing portfolio, the -- about 8 million that you cited, is that mostly coming from overlapping sites, your expectation for it? Or...\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the $4 million to $5 million that we've already been noticed on, almost all of that is on overlapping sites. The remaining $2 million to $3 million is predominantly overlap sites as well.\nBatya Levi : Got it. And one more thing maybe on DISH. As we take out some of the equipment for the narrowband IoT network that they had put on your towers, would that show up as churn? Or would that be captured within the new deals that they have with you?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, it depends on what happens with those leases. There is a potential under our deal with them that they would transition those sites to their new architecture, in which case, it would just simply be an amendment, depending on what the change was there based on the original lease. If they're actually going to cancel a lease altogether and not use that site, then it would show up as churn.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins : A couple of questions, if I could, on Slide 8 in the supplemental deck. So there's been a few different questions around how you may allocate capital in 2021. And just curious, I look at this slide, for the last 4 years, the range of capital allocation dollars in total has been about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. And just curious, given everything that you discussed on the call and the guidance that you outlined, is there a range of dollars for 2021 that we should keep in mind? And then you've also put the period ending leverage on this chart over the last few years, and just curious how you look at the influences of what would get you comfortable to keeping net debt leverage at that higher end of the 7.5 times range you mentioned versus the lower end of 7 times? And just finally, I heard that $10 per share AFFO goal mentioned that you set out to reach 5 years ago. I'm just curious if you have a new 5-year expectation that you're considering or you may share with us just to provide a sort of a compass of what that future direction might look like?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. I'll take the last one first, Mike. The answer is no because of the -- notwithstanding how close we came and how proud we are understanding and projecting the operating components of our business, we -- at least through the AFFO per share line, we found that the movements in interest rates and FX were beyond our prognostication capabilities. So we have declined to do that just as of yet. In terms of the amount of potential CapEx that we could spend, I mean, I don't -- I could tell you we can all get to it fairly easily by looking at the EBITDA contribution that is in our outlook. And then if you bought some things versus bought some stock back, and you ended up with 7.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, that would produce an amount of capital that would fill in your answer. And I don't know if that's how it's going to end up or not. It will depend on whether we choose stock repurchases or acquisitions or whether, in fact, we actually choose to end the year at 7.5 times. We may choose not to do that. And whether we do choose to do that or not, we could continue to depend on whether we see a very -- continue to see a very benign interest rate environment and whether we continue to feel as optimistic as we do today about carrier activity ramping as we move to the end of the year and into 2022.\nMichael Rollins : And just in terms of the leverage, what factors get you comfortable at that high end versus low end of the range? And not just maybe in the moment, but over time?\nJeff Stoops : Well, I mean, over time, that would come down. In the moment, it would be because we found things that based on everything I just talked about, we thought it would be very value creative, we took advantage of it this year rather than letting it go by.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Spencer Kurn, New Street Research.\nSpencer Kurn : I wanted to follow-up on the trajectory of new leasing activity and organic growth in the U.S. this year. So you exited -- or you ended the fourth quarter with gross organic growth of about 5.7%, and it looks like you're guiding to 5.9% for the year in 2021. And that should sort of steadily -- you expected organic growth to steadily increase throughout the year. Can you just help us understand the cadence sort of when you expect the low point to be? And what we should expect for an exit rate for 2021 to help us understand sort of what growth we could anticipate in 2022?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yes. Spencer, I mean, it certainly will be lower in the first part of the year, the first couple of quarters. We definitely expect to exit the year at a higher rate, not really prepared to say exactly what that is, but at a rate that is starting to ramp back towards where we've been in the past. Obviously, we're kind of at a low, you can tell by looking at our charts, the trajectory of where it's gone to. And we've talked a lot, I think about having a slower year than anticipated last year. That certainly affects what we report, for instance, in the first quarter and second quarter of 2021. But based on our expectations for the increasing activity in the latter part of the year, I would expect that we will exit the year in the fourth quarter at a rate that is higher than the average that's implied by our guidance, and it will build into next year.\nSpencer Kurn : Awesome. And just one more. It looks like you've got churn increasing next year largely as a result of Sprint and T-Mobile churn but it still seems like normalized churn, excluding other mergers is still hovering around 1.5%. I've always thought of the long-term opportunity for churn to fall below 1%, do you see a runway to getting there over the next couple of years?\nJeff Stoops : Well, we've been there actually before. If you go back a couple of years ago, we were below 1%. But our historical range is typically between 1% and 2% right now. We're towards the higher end of that. And I would expect that there'll be times in the future where we're higher and times where we're lower, but it tends to fluctuate based on what's happening with specific carriers at specific times.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long : Two, if I could. Number one, maybe just a higher-level question. Given DISH is kind of a new player and the established players looks like they've spent a bunch on the C-Band auction, anything different that we're seeing or that you would expect from pricing or terms of new activity or amendments? And then second, on the CBRS and private side, have you seen any activity there starting to tick up to help as we go through 2021 and into 2022?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. So Tim, on the DISH question, I mean, you say anything different on terms, well, it's actually a very different network. It's kind of the card from the whole full cloth and a clean sheet of paper. So no amendments, it will be brand-new installations of brand-new cell sites, different kind of equipment. So it's very hard to compare. It's just different. So I'm not quite sure what you're looking for in terms of comparing what the DISH terms and particularly rates are compared to, say, an AT&T, a Verizon or a T-Mobile, it's just different. In terms of CBRS, actually, we are. And it's where it's showing up more and more frequently is as a solution to governmental, municipal and school district providers as an elegant and cost-effective solution to bridge some of these digital divide issues that we've all been reading about. And these are some things that we've been participating in and actually are quite a bit excited about. Again, not material this year in terms of financial contribution, but technically and certainly from a community perspective, very exciting.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrandon Nispel : Jeff, I was hoping you could quantify the year-over-year change in the backlog number that you referenced at the start of the call?\nJeff Stoops : Year-over-year, well, that was -- Brendan...?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yes. I mean, Brandon, it's hard for me to put an exact number on it. But our backlogs today are much higher than they were a year ago at this time. I can't give you a specific percentage on that. And obviously, the makeup of the backlog has a lot to do with how that plays out in terms of its financial impact, but they're definitely up. There's a lot more applications received.\nBrandon Nispel : Fair enough. Different question. Jeff, maybe could you walk us through your thoughts on potentially reaching an expanded MLA with T-Mobile or even reaching one with Verizon, I guess that goes above and beyond the T-Mobile agreement today. And really, what's keeping your business from being more heavily indexed to Verizon given your exposure there is relatively low?\nJeff Stoops : We're not opposed to any MLA with any customer. It's just that we never have been. It's just a question of a mutual agreement. So we do have -- I'm glad you corrected yourself. We do have an agreement with T-Mobile today. It's not, I think, fully holistic. And at some point, it may get there. And we would certainly be very open to those discussions if T-Mobile went at that, I mean just as we were with DISH and have been historically with Sprint and T-Mobile and others. So that's -- it just takes two to tango, right?\nBrandon Nispel : Just from my perspective, it would seem as if that there is a caret in that you guys have 70% of your T-Mobile or Sprint leases going off after the next 3 years, and that's 70% of their synergies. So I guess, do you see a win-win coming in the near-term where you can get more clarity on what the potential churn in booking or backlog activity might look like in the more near term?\nJeff Stoops : There are probably a lot of mutually beneficial outcomes that could happen there, Brandon. I don't think I want to negotiate with you over the earnings call.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSami Badri : Thank you for also squeezing me in. I just want to make sure I get the numbers right on the churn for 2021. And I think you said $8 million of churn from the T-Mobile-Sprint dynamic. And that's from your currently informed view. Does this mean that churn could potentially come in a little bit higher than that if T-Mobile decides to accelerate some of its cost rationalization and synergies?\nJeff Stoops : Yes. It's unlikely, Sami, because our estimates contemplate pretty much -- the only thing that they can do, there may be small differences, but if it's going to be different, it probably would be slightly lower.\nSami Badri : Got it. Got it. And then my other question has to do with M&A. And I know you've targeted very specific developing markets for your M&A mandates. But given recently one of your peers making a push into Europe, does this change where you may potentially be looking to do deals?\nJeff Stoops : No. We actually look everywhere, but we only act where we think it's clear that we can create substantial value relative to the cost and the risk of the investment and we will continue to look broadly and widely and probably act narrowly.\nSami Badri : Got it. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops : Ryan, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino : Just on my comment on acquisitions. Can you comment on how competitive bidding is for tower assets in Latin America? And the reason I ask is it feels like the past 2 tower transactions we've seen in developed countries are really sought after, and that's been reflected in the full prices that are paid. So are you seeing a similar dynamic in emerging countries?\nJeff Stoops : I would say it's a little bit less pricy, David, but it's still pricing. We have to be very disciplined and very careful and understand what you're buying. And you have to start with the premise that it's only in the United States that you have the tax shield provided by the REIT architecture, which everywhere else, you're a taxpayer.\nDavid Guarino : Thanks for that.\nJeff Stoops : So Ryan, I think we are done.\nOperator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a strong finish to 2020 with solid financial and operating results. The fourth quarter was our best quarter of the year in terms of organic leasing activity and services results, and we added a number of high-quality assets to our portfolio. We produced $2.49 of AFFO per share, or $0.01 short of an annualized rate of $10 per share. Our AFFO per share for the quarter represented material growth over the prior year period and demonstrates the value creation capability of this business. We also continued to invest in our company through material share repurchases, buying back 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and we did not slow down as we moved into 2021. Since year-end, we have signed up and closed on our large and exciting transaction with PG&E, repurchased an additional 0.5 million shares of our stock and signed up a master lease agreement with DISH. All of these activities will have long-lasting positive implications for SBA. We've demonstrated our ability over the years to find specific targeted opportunities where we can add assets at accretive prices and bring our expertise to bear in extracting and maximizing value. We're particularly pleased with the PG&E transaction. We've added a large number of high-quality, exclusive locations in Northern California to our portfolio at what we believe is an attractive price. We believe our experience and operational expertise will allow us to maximize the potential for wireless use of these assets for the benefit of both our wireless carrier customers and PG&E. With regard to our domestic leasing business, our customers are all turning their attention toward their 5G network investment plans. The significant investment in the current C-Band auction is evidence of the critical role that mid-band spectrum will play in the deployment of next-generation networks. And as a result, the importance of macro tower sites in the next wave of network investment. We believe it has been well settled that the primary use of C-Band spectrum will be on macro sites outside of urban markets. Hey, Rick. You're right on both counts. Brendan? Yes. I do think we can get -- I don't know if we can get to double digits, but I do think we can get to upper single digits. I think what's happening this year is, if you think about it, you got a couple major carriers who are rumored to be heavy into the C-Band auctions, which means that there's going to be a lot to do. And if there's going to be a lot to do, you know there's going to be a lot to do, and you might push off what you can do today until tomorrow. And then you have one carrier in the name of DISH, who's already told you very clearly when they're going to start doing things, it kind of makes -- I think it's pretty clear as to the pace of things and the timing of things in 2021, but then it sets up for a very, very attractive 2022, particularly over 2021 comparable. Yes. And obviously, we'll be well suited to talk to DISH about any of those sites that T-Mobile decides they no longer want. Yes. We really have not included any C-Band revenue in our 2021 guidance -- leasing guidance and the same with DISH. Now there certainly are arguments and optimism that, that could change, and things could happen where we do realize that, but it's not in there today, Jon. Well, we've received quite a bit of information already, which we've been able to share with you on our outlook. But we're not -- we don't know that we've received at all. But we've had -- I mean, based on the timing of notices and things, I would tell you that I think we have the lion's share of the information already at this point. As it relates to 2021. Yes. Yes. We continue to have a number of opportunities that we're pursuing to actually move forward and tie. What we're focusing on, Jon, is the areas around the data centers to work on the direct ties between true mobile edge at the tower site type facilities, which have direct connections back, and we've got a number of different things that we're working on there. And we would just ask you to stay tuned there because we think there continues to be a lot of exciting opportunities and things that we can do there. But I think it's... ...it will be not a material contributor to 2021. It's not quite 9 months. Well, we probably have, at the absolute minimum 4 but more likely 6. . It is a number of leases. It is not -- it is -- if you could look at it as one because there are certain dollar parameters that we've agreed to per lease, but it is a minimum site. Well, we do have some time breaks in there. So there are -- it's a little more defined than that. But -- so over the life of the contract, before all the commitments are ultimately due, but there -- it's not only until the end are they due. There are some due for a long time. We've been seeing that for a while with T-Mobile-Sprint on the 2.5G. Yes. Well, it means we don't have to rush, but we would like to be at the high end of the target or below by year-end. But that statement gives us quite a bit of flexibility. I think the key answer to your question is, are you going to rush to do it in 1 quarter? Or are you going to wait until the end of the year to preserve maximum flexibility? And the answer is the latter. Based on the firm commitment that we have, the answer is yes. So I guess the answer to your second question is yes. No. I think T-Mobile is doing just as we thought. They're very busy, very active, very deliberate, very, very -- they're a force. There's -- it's all very busy, and we see a strong year ahead for them. Yes, why don't you go first, then I'll wrap it up with the more philosophical. Yes. In terms of whether this opens up a new source of relationships between tower companies and utilities, David, I mean, I think it remains to be seen. It's not the first. There have been a couple of other transactions between tower companies and utilities. They were not involving any of the publics, however, so this might be the third. And this one was fairly unique in particularly as to its geographic location, but we'll see. We've actually had more than a couple of inquiries. Utilities have very different primary considerations that they have to think about and it has to fit bearings, but we found certainly, in the case of PG&E that it did, and I'm sure that those characteristics could be met again. And because it's never the primary, and frankly, can't be the primary focus of a utility company to make tower leasing top of mind or the number 1 thing they think about, there's always going to be an element of improvement that can be an arbitrage there for the benefit of everyone. So we'll see. We'll see. I said mid, but go ahead. On the Sprint T-Mobile piece, it was $4 million to $5 million is the number based on what we've already specifically received notices on. The incremental $3 million is an estimate that we've included in our outlook in churn assumptions that we put forth in our bridge, for instance, that's not yet been specifically noted to us, but we are estimating based on what we see in terms of the timing when those leases come due. The 299 lease -- or sorry, sites that are under contract from an M&A standpoint, the vast majority of those are located internationally, but they're spread out. There are some in, I think, the biggest country is South Africa, but there's some throughout Latin America as well. And your first question is on the growth rates. Yes. I think the question was about net. And we're thinking -- we believe that there is an opportunity to see that go back up to mid-levels, above 5, I guess, you could consider more than mid, but we think there's opportunity with all the growth that's out there. The biggest challenge, frankly, on that, Colby, is really about the churn, the Sprint T-Mobile churn. I mean, if you figure that in, that's certainly going to weigh on it. But if you put that aside, there certainly is an opportunity from the growth set that's in front of us. Yes. And obviously, higher gross. There's a small number of sites. So the total purchase price is about $973 million. We've closed on $954 million of that, so the vast majority of it. There's some number of sites that have certain specific issues that have to be addressed, but we expect them to be cleaned up in the next 6 months, and those sites will just close later. Yes. I think amendments will always play a big role, Brett, because they're the most efficient and I think economically beneficial for our customers. And then I think existing structures will get colocation because the existing regulatory regime tapers that. But yes, there'll be some more towers still. There's no question, not only because of the spectrum propagation, but because, I think on a perhaps totally unrelated reason, there's going to be a fair amount of emphasis on closing the digital divide and just bringing broadband to everyone, which is clearly going to require that some more towers get built. I think it has to depend on the facts and circumstances. I believe that wherever you can get a true tower, a macro site that always gives our customers the most bang for their buck, but I do believe you will see this spectrum used in conjunction with small cells as well in areas where you just don't get towers. It doesn't mean those areas aren't going to be served, they're going to be served by alternate architecture. And in terms specifically of DISH, while we could see some leasing revenue, there's none really contemplated in the guidance and very little contemplated in the services revenue guidance. Although, again, depending on timing, it could be better. Yes. Brazil has had a couple of issues that have been impacting it, the overhang of the Oi transaction, which is working itself through, which we think, long-term, will be favorable. For us, it looks like TIM will get most of those -- well, not most, but the predominant amount of those assets with Claro next, and then Telefonica the third or the last lease amount, which bodes well for us from an overlap perspective. And then obviously, they've had their issues with COVID. So as those things settle out, Brazil is actually expected to have quite a material jump in their GDP moving from 2020 to 2021. So as those things kind of play themselves out, yes, we do expect Brazil to get back to its best growing self. Yes. We've got pages and pages and legal fees and legal fees that we're addressing at that point. The structure of the deal, the regulatory posture of where we sit versus where PG&E sits well into this deal, I could spend quite a bit of time with you on that, but I could also just say we're covered. Yes. There are not many tenants per tower on the 28,000 today. I don't think they've ever frankly been marketed. The -- on the existing ones, I think I mentioned in my prepared comments that we have approximately 900 tenants, a little more than 900 tenants across those roughly 700 sites. So it's been a totally kind of carriers have had to seek out the appropriate PG&E folks to -- which is the way it works with a type of relationship, which is why we think we could bring additional value. And to be honest with you, I can't hazard a guess on the 28,000, but I can promise you it'll be something. Well, if you -- if we saw those type of dynamics as you described, that would bear in favor of stock repurchases if we saw more opportunities like PG&E, it would. Canada has 3.5 gigahertz tentatively scheduled for June. South Africa has an entire suite of 5G spectrum tentatively scheduled for next quarter. Peru has a big one for later this first-half, Chile, Colombia and Brazil. In terms of the money being spent, Simon, I see that and I read that -- I have to assume that our customers know exactly what they're doing, I'm sure that they do. And for that spectrum to have value to them, it has to be deployed. I don't know exactly what the cost will change for them. But ultimately, it's going to have to get put out there. And that's kind of all we can work with. And whether it's 1 quarter, 2 quarters or 3 quarters difference, in the overall scheme of the value creation for us, it really doesn't matter. All of those sites. Yes. I'll take the last one first, Mike. The answer is no because of the -- notwithstanding how close we came and how proud we are understanding and projecting the operating components of our business, we -- at least through the AFFO per share line, we found that the movements in interest rates and FX were beyond our prognostication capabilities. So we have declined to do that just as of yet. In terms of the amount of potential CapEx that we could spend, I mean, I don't -- I could tell you we can all get to it fairly easily by looking at the EBITDA contribution that is in our outlook. And then if you bought some things versus bought some stock back, and you ended up with 7.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, that would produce an amount of capital that would fill in your answer. And I don't know if that's how it's going to end up or not. It will depend on whether we choose stock repurchases or acquisitions or whether, in fact, we actually choose to end the year at 7.5 times. We may choose not to do that. And whether we do choose to do that or not, we could continue to depend on whether we see a very -- continue to see a very benign interest rate environment and whether we continue to feel as optimistic as we do today about carrier activity ramping as we move to the end of the year and into 2022. Well, I mean, over time, that would come down. In the moment, it would be because we found things that based on everything I just talked about, we thought it would be very value creative, we took advantage of it this year rather than letting it go by. Well, we've been there actually before. If you go back a couple of years ago, we were below 1%. But our historical range is typically between 1% and 2% right now. We're towards the higher end of that. And I would expect that there'll be times in the future where we're higher and times where we're lower, but it tends to fluctuate based on what's happening with specific carriers at specific times. Yes. So Tim, on the DISH question, I mean, you say anything different on terms, well, it's actually a very different network. It's kind of the card from the whole full cloth and a clean sheet of paper. So no amendments, it will be brand-new installations of brand-new cell sites, different kind of equipment. So it's very hard to compare. It's just different. So I'm not quite sure what you're looking for in terms of comparing what the DISH terms and particularly rates are compared to, say, an AT&T, a Verizon or a T-Mobile, it's just different. In terms of CBRS, actually, we are.

And these are some things that we've been participating in and actually are quite a bit excited about. Again, not material this year in terms of financial contribution, but technically and certainly from a community perspective, very exciting. Year-over-year, well, that was -- Brendan...? We're not opposed to any MLA with any customer. It's just that we never have been. It's just a question of a mutual agreement. So we do have -- I'm glad you corrected yourself. We do have an agreement with T-Mobile today. It's not, I think, fully holistic. And at some point, it may get there. And we would certainly be very open to those discussions if T-Mobile went at that, I mean just as we were with DISH and have been historically with Sprint and T-Mobile and others. So that's -- it just takes two to tango, right? There are probably a lot of mutually beneficial outcomes that could happen there, Brandon. I don't think I want to negotiate with you over the earnings call. Yes. It's unlikely, Sami, because our estimates contemplate pretty much -- the only thing that they can do, there may be small differences, but if it's going to be different, it probably would be slightly lower. No. We actually look everywhere, but we only act where we think it's clear that we can create substantial value relative to the cost and the risk of the investment and we will continue to look broadly and widely and probably act narrowly.

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had a very strong end to the year with fourth quarter results near the high end of our outlook for all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $493 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $492.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $3.5 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the fourth quarter. They were, again, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $17.7 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.4% on a net basis, including 2.3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter, was at the highest levels of the year. We saw continued increased activity levels with T-Mobile during the quarter, and our domestic application backlog continues to grow. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 88% of our domestic bookings, with 12% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Yes. Rick, so if you look at our bridge for 2020 and 2021, we've got about $40 million of non-organic revenue coming in. I would say, the majority of that, $35-ish million of that, is coming from PG&E. Yes. It's within a couple of million dollars, because there's no -- the key thing is obviously the ground rent. They own the majority of land or have rights to it, so there's really no ground rent expense at all. So the margins are extremely high on this. So the vast majority of the revenue drops through to the bottom line. Yes, Rick. So we've already -- I think we announced on our previous call that we've already received some non-renewal notifications from T-Mobile. And just to give you some numbers, for next year, 2021 being next year, that represents about $4 million to $5 million of the impact to our revenue loss. In addition to that, in our outlook, we expect, based on when leases come up and communications we've had already, that will probably be somewhere - an additional $3 million or so from them. As we look out over the future years, right at this point, we're basically measuring it based on where we have overlapping sites and what the timing is when those leases come up. That puts the majority of the terminations in terms of their financial impact for us in 2025 and 2026. We will see probably about 30% of the total exposure over the next three years. As it relates to this year, as it relates to 2021. Yes. We have, just to be clear, Nick, I mean, we have plenty of capacity to continue to do typical levels of M&A and buybacks and still be within our target leverage range at the end of the year. Sure. Yes. Well, I'll take the last one first. On the PG&E piece, it does step up a little bit during the year, but it's relatively small, David. I would expect it to not be significant steps up. There are escalators that are built in, and we would expect a modest amount of new lease-up. Obviously, we just brought these sites into our portfolio. So there will be some step up, but it will be generally run rated at the same pace. Of course, the first quarter will obviously be materially lower than the other quarters as we only have it in our portfolio for half the quarter. But on a run rate basis, it will be very small step up throughout the year. On the international churn side, the $10 million is definitely not the new normal. There are some specific things that are driving that number up. I do expect it, though, to be elevated probably next year as well. It's hard for us to say exactly what the number will be because we are in the midst of discussions with the carriers, where there's been some consolidation as well as the other customer where we've had some work with them to try and help them through some issues that they have. So I do expect that there will be additional impact next year, but the exact amount remains to be seen. But eventually, we'll get through those issues, and I would not expect to be at that level long-term. Actually, I thought Rick's question was gross so. Yes, Amir, so our outlook for '21 does assume a pace of activity that is increasing throughout the year, so it's definitely a little bit slower is our assumption here at the beginning of the year, and it picks up in the latter half of the year. That's consistent with our comments we've been making around C-Band and the DISH MLA, all those things will certainly drive more leasing activity in the latter half of the year. But even then, the impact of that to our financial statements will be limited because of the timing of signing up new agreements to when they actually start to recognize revenue. So I don't -- it will step up, I believe, throughout the year, but I think you'll start to see the benefits of that increase next year or late this year. On the tenant mix for PG&E, the vast majority, almost all of the revenue comes from the big 3 wireless carriers. There is some Sprint overlap, which we obviously included any exposure to that in our underwriting assumptions. It's not particularly material, where we have both T-Mobile and Sprint on the same site, and the average remaining term for those tenants is about 7 years. So there's quite an extensive time -- runway left on that. On those sites, for this year, we're not really expecting to see any Sprint T-Mobile churn this year. So our numbers that we gave you on our outlook don't include anything for PG&E. Yes. So the $4 million to $5 million that we've already been noticed on, almost all of that is on overlapping sites. The remaining $2 million to $3 million is predominantly overlap sites as well. Well, it depends on what happens with those leases. There is a potential under our deal with them that they would transition those sites to their new architecture, in which case, it would just simply be an amendment, depending on what the change was there based on the original lease. If they're actually going to cancel a lease altogether and not use that site, then it would show up as churn. Yes. Spencer, I mean, it certainly will be lower in the first part of the year, the first couple of quarters. We definitely expect to exit the year at a higher rate, not really prepared to say exactly what that is, but at a rate that is starting to ramp back towards where we've been in the past. Obviously, we're kind of at a low, you can tell by looking at our charts, the trajectory of where it's gone to. And we've talked a lot, I think about having a slower year than anticipated last year. That certainly affects what we report, for instance, in the first quarter and second quarter of 2021. But based on our expectations for the increasing activity in the latter part of the year, I would expect that we will exit the year in the fourth quarter at a rate that is higher than the average that's implied by our guidance, and it will build into next year. Yes. I mean, Brandon, it's hard for me to put an exact number on it. But our backlogs today are much higher than they were a year ago at this time. I can't give you a specific percentage on that. And obviously, the makeup of the backlog has a lot to do with how that plays out in terms of its financial impact, but they're definitely up. There's a lot more applications received."

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you, Rich. Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA once again had very strong results in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations in all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $486.8 million and cash site leasing revenues were $486.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $1 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the third quarter. They were again however a significant headwind on comparison to the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $20.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.1% over the third quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6.0%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year, was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter increased over the first half of 2020 levels, but remains below levels we were seeing in the year ago period. The sequential increase in domestic new bookings was driven primarily by increased activity with T-Mobile. Based on conversations with our customers and continued growth in our domestic application backlog, we anticipate seeing this activity continue to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2012. During the third quarter, amendment activity remained the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed-up domestic leasing revenue coming 80% from amendments, and 20% from new leases. The Big 3 carriers represented 83% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.1%, including 0.4% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. Our international leasing activity was up modestly over first half 2020 levels, but still remains impacted by continued COVID-related spending reductions by our customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease up. Gross same tower organic growth in Brazil was 9% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 86% of consolidated cash site leasing fee revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollars denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of total debt and $10.5 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x at the low end of our target range. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.2x. On July 14, through a trust, we issued $750 million of 1.884% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 29, 2026, as well as $600 million of 2.328% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028. The aggregate $1.35 billion of Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.081% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment dates of 6.4 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2015-1C and 2016-1C Tower Securities, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. As a result of this financing, our next debt maturity is not until April 2022. As of today, we have no outstanding balance under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3.1% with the weighted average maturity of approximately 4.2 years. During the third quarter, we repurchased 580,000 shares of our common stock for $175.6 million or an average price of $302.63 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, we have repurchased 415,000 shares for $124.4 million or an average price per share of $299.54. Today, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan, effective immediately, replacing the previous $1 billion plan, which had a $124 million of repurchase authorization remaining. The company\u2019s shares outstanding, as of September 30, 2020 are 111.4 million compared to 112.6 million at September 30, 2019, a reduction of 1.1%. In addition, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent fourth quarter dividend of $0.465 per share payable on December 17, 2020 to shareholders of record, as of the close of business, on November 19, 2020. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. We had another strong financial performance in the third quarter. We produced leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share that were all ahead of both our expectations and consensus expectations. The year has developed almost exactly as we predicted it would on our last earnings call. U.S. customer activity has increased due to T-Mobile activity increasing post merger. International business remained stable to improving, but still challenged due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in those markets, and the capital markets remained very friendly to our company. Because we see further increased U.S. leasing activity in the future over 2020 levels, at a time where international markets recover from today\u2019s COVID-19 challenges, we continue to invest capital in both portfolio growth and by repurchasing our stock which investments, we believe will help fuel future growth in AFFO per share and dividends per share.\nOperator: Certainly.  We will begin with the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. So, Jeff, you discussed T-Mobile ramping and probably ramps further from the fourth quarter. Do you see signs that other carriers could be slowing down in the next year that would sort of net some of that growth out?\nJeff Stoops: I don\u2019t think materially. I think we will see a period of time, though, in 2021, before we will see the highest levels of activity we expect, particularly with respect to the C-band, because that\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But I don\u2019t know, I mean, of course, anything can happen, but I don\u2019t see signs today that T-Mobile going one way and the other two are going in the opposite direction.\nPhil Cusick: That\u2019s great. And then what momentum do you see in the deployment of MIMO and kind of this is something we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years. Does that wait for C-band to be deployed as well or you\u2019re seeing that happen today?\nJeff Stoops: Well, we\u2019re seeing it happen today because we\u2019re seeing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum being deployed today. And, I mean, that is the preferred way, my understanding, that is the preferred way and the most efficient way to get the most out of the mid-band spectrum for 5G.\nPhil Cusick: That makes sense. And one more if I can. What do you see in activity levels in Brazil? And how does that compare to what you expected when you bought more sites in December? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Well, we didn\u2019t see COVID, and we didn\u2019t see the \u2013 we did not see the level of the FX adjustment, which I think is, in large part, due to. But what we have seen is a steady currency \u2013 constant currency adjusted, very good demand, Phil, for those assets, and we think over time and with some improvement in those COVID conditions, we\u2019re going to see tremendous improvement in the numbers coming out of Brazil. But I would certainly be telling you, Phil, if we foresaw everything that has gone on in Brazil this year back in December.\nPhil Cusick: I don\u2019t think anybody could say that, but it does sound like there\u2019s still good demand in that market despite COVID.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, there is. I mean, if you were to strip back \u2013 I mean, if you look at the demand and the growth rates that Brendan talked about and you see in our numbers on a constant currency basis, we\u2019re very pleased with where things are. And that\u2019s still on a year and in an environment where these customers have pulled back materially in their CapEx in response to COVID. And they basically said that, look, this is temporary, and we\u2019re going to need to spend more money coming out of this thing. So we\u2019re very \u2013 we continue to be very happy with our Brazilian operations.\nPhil Cusick: Okay.\nOperator: And we will now go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good evening. You talked about Dish and T-Mobile, you didn\u2019t talk about \u2013 much about Cable they were very active in the CBRS. So I wondered, Jeff, do you think Cable can be a contributor in \u201821 and beyond? How are those conversations going? And on T-Mobile, they have a real interest in reducing some of the old  Sprint sites. Is there an opportunity, you think, to work with them to come up with some structure to allow them to take down some of those sites quicker than the current contracts allow?\nJeff Stoops: We don\u2019t really have any of the , Simon. What we have are just straight Sprint leases that are of a more regular Sprint network deployment that have various termination dates over time and we\u2019re always open to discussions. In terms of Cable, we do have Cable, lot of demand for some of our tower space. I don\u2019t know that Cable will ever have a desire to mount a \u2013 or the spectrum ability to mount a greenfield nationwide build out the way the other four will have. But we certainly do see some incremental demand and benefit from their spectrum holds.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And then just one quick one for Brendan on the leverage, you were at the low end of leverage of 7x. Is that \u2013 you\u2019re going to keep that there with the buybacks? How should we think about your desire to stay at that 7x versus coming down lower depending on where the stock price is, if you don\u2019t have other M&A opportunities?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean, it\u2019s our desire to stay within that target range. We\u2019re at the low end of it now. It\u2019s \u2013 in terms of the share buybacks and the asset acquisitions, it\u2019s really a matter of being opportunistic around what\u2019s available to us at a given time. So we\u2019re there today, largely through share buybacks in the third quarter and we\u2019ve done some already in the fourth quarter. So you should expect we\u2019ll be somewhere around the same range going forward.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. Can you remind us how we should think about the pacing of the T-Mobile churn? I think this shared churn is coming in a little less than 2%. Maybe some early color for next year, if there is anything that we should look forward to and on when you would think T-Mo to ramp up?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, we \u2013 so we have seen a little bit of churn notifications from T-Mobile, thus far, around 100 leases or so. That is relatively small, probably in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of its impact for next year. When you look at our overall churn end date, though, in terms of the overlap in particular, we have almost 4 years left on average for the Sprint leases that are on \u2013 sorry, for T-Mobile it is, and \u2013 but when you look at the specific dates, most of it is out about 5 to 6 years. So we expect that we\u2019re going to start seeing that stuff heavily weighted toward the back end.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will now go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Hi, great. Maybe just a follow-up on that, there is a lot of talk obviously about leasing increase in the next few quarters, including in the fourth quarter and then I guess you mentioned up further into 2021. But when you think about the net same-store growth rate \u201821 versus 2020, is there a risk that the churn could step up to such a level that effectively offset the increase in new demand that you\u2019re anticipating to a point where the same-store growth rate in 2021 would actually be below that of 2020 despite this increase in new activity that you\u2019re seeing? And I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give too much on \u201821 just yet, but you might appreciate that that\u2019s a big focus for investors right now. And then secondly, I was just wondering about the capital allocation. You talked about that 5% to 10% portfolio growth over a long period of time. It sounds like there is perhaps less to do internationally, right now, just given the economic situation down there. Should we anticipate that you just continue to step up the buyback in the interim? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: You take the first one I will take the second one.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Okay. Yes, Colby, so on the churn question, most \u2013 based on the way that it works when we give those same tower growth rates, it\u2019s usually driven mostly by stuff that\u2019s happening this year and into the first part of next year. So a lot of that is unknown. So I don\u2019t expect the churn to be materially higher, although there is some potential for some additional notes. We\u2019re not ready to give \u201821 numbers yet. And I think when we give them, we\u2019ll have a little bit better view on whether there is certain plans from T-Mobile around some of that churn. But the overall growth rates will also be influenced by the activity levels in terms of new leasing activity this year as well, so  until next quarter to get the actual numbers. But what\u2019s happening today and the slowdown we saw in the first part of the year, this year, will have some impact on next year\u2019s same tower growth numbers because it is a trailing indicator.\nJeff Stoops: Yes and how soon we start seeing next year, which frankly, we just don\u2019t know yet today the benefits that will come from Dish really digging in and starting to deploy and the C-band deployments. So, on the \u2013 Colby, the 5% to 10% that continues to be the goal, we are not going to hit it this year. If you add this year and last year, we will have averaged greater than 5%, but that\u2019s not going to be how we target things. We just didn\u2019t see the number of opportunities this year that we thought made sense from a pricing perspective. There were enough opportunities out there to hit those numbers. I believe there will continue to be enough opportunities out there. But for us, it\u2019s not only the number, it\u2019s the price and it\u2019s the quality. Unless it all comes together in the right way, we\u2019re not going to buy stuff just to buy stuff and that\u2019s where we are this year. But I don\u2019t think this is indicative that there is not going to be 5% to 10% next year.\nColby Synesael: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will now go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. So, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One follow-up to begin with, so, you mentioned there is a delay between the booking and the billings and so that lag effect has impact going into \u201821. Can you share with us what that current book to bill duration is and maybe how that compares to the historical kind of range? And then just taking a step back, with the data center purchased this past quarter, curious if you could share your learnings and what you are getting from the data center model and how you see this edge opportunity playing out for SBA over time?\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the book to bill, it\u2019s typically 6 to 12 months. It can vary a little bit depending on the mix amendments and the type of activity that\u2019s been done by the carriers, but I would say we\u2019re seeing it stretch out a little bit longer than it has in the past. I think there\u2019s so many major projects going on in particular with T-Mobile that the delayed maintenance are a little bit longer than they happened in the past, but 6 to 12 months is the typical range.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And on the data center, Mike, we\u2019ve now got two, and the purpose is to understand the data center business, data center model, so that we can be in a position when the opportunity is right to know whether we\u2019re going to be operators of many data centers on our cell sites or something less, landlords or maybe something in between. What we\u2019ve learned so far is that it is definitely a different sales business, different customers, but that there are a number of different applications and needs where by having a larger regional data center that is well connected with fiber, lot of interconnect, a lot of meet-me type rooms there, that\u2019s an attractive offering to folks who may want to also have smaller installations at the tower site. We call that the hub-and-spoke theory. At the end of the day, for all of this to make sense, it has to be on our land at the tower site. That\u2019s what this is all about. It\u2019s not separately getting into an unconnected data center business. But for us to understand how to maximize that, we thought that some experience with and kind of experimentation with these two data centers, one in Chicago, one in Jacksonville and Jacksonville, it has also some undersea cable connections, will give us the right experience and skill set. So, more on that as it comes, it\u2019s not going to be material to our financial results any time for the next several years. But it could be a key to really unlocking some value and frankly, land that we\u2019ve already kind of got the sunk cost and sunk investment in. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019re excited about over the long term.\nMichael Rollins: And just with respect to that, is there any sense of how many of these hubs that you may need? Like does a hub need to be in the biggest NFL, NBA-type cities or do you think that the hubs need to actually be much closer to the eyeballs in the used cases, and so you might have many hubs and spokes? Like, how do you think about that at least from your initial learnings?\nJeff Stoops: Yes, so far the delta \u2013 it\u2019s more of a regional Tier 2, Tier 3 markets for the hubs. So it could be more rather than less, but you got to have the spokes side of things more developed out for this to \u2013 for me to be able to sit and tell you that there\u2019s going to be more than two months. That\u2019s why we have the two to prove out now the spokes side of things, and these are both areas where we have a fair number of tower sites to do all kinds of different expected business models, but if there are enough tower sites that connect and makes sense, then you\u2019ve got the creation of another hub opportunity and whether that needs to be owned or partnered, it doesn\u2019t have to be more than the other.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: We will now go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Jeff, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned the C-band and you acknowledged that it could take a little bit of time for that to fully benefit the company. One of the questions we\u2019ve been getting is how do we think about the factors that actually determine what that timeline or trajectory is because it seems like there\u2019s two considerations and I\u2019m not sure how to weigh them against you, one of which is just, where your towers are relative to the clearing timeline because there\u2019s going to be a couple of tranches there and which is clear. The other is just which of your  and they are buying a lot of C-bands. So I was hoping really you could just expand for us, as best you can, your thought process around when you think your assets are actually going to be positioned to start to benefit from that reconnected? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Well, I mean, you kind of answered it for me. You really won\u2019t know until the auctions are done and what got taken by who and where. But one of the benefits of giving the 2020 outlook when we give it is, we hope to have some of that information by then. So we will look at that and bring in whatever we can from the results and be able to factor that into our outlook. I do believe a large part of \u2013 at least the early feelings will be based on the dollar spent and the belief that the folks who spend the large dollars and folks have indicated that they are looking to do that. They will be looking to deploy as quickly as they can. So that is kind of how we are going to triangulate things. But it is not going to be \u2013 it is hard for me to say with specificity now, without knowing the first thing about who won what and where.\nBrett Feldman: Do you have enough towers in the markets that are kind of in charge line such that it actually could be meaningful catalysts for you over the next 12 or 18 months or you would be willing to wait until the majority of that spectrum is clear or you don\u2019t know it yet?\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I think the spectrum clearing is going to go faster than folks think, just like it did on the TV spectrum. Some of it\u2019s going to go faster, some of it may not. There is every incentive for the folks who win that spectrum for purchasing, I guess, because they are purchasing it, in some cases, arguably to stay competitive with a rapidly deploying T-Mobile to get things done very quickly. And I think that it\u2019s going to bode well for us and our industry.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on Brett\u2019s C-band question, there are presumably smaller share of towers in which the carriers can economically deploy C-bands, especially in rural areas, just given the propagation attributes versus traditional mu band. How would you dimension the share of towers that might not be well positioned to host C-band or do you not think that\u2019s the right way to think about it?\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I suspect there will be some, but I think in large part where they have \u2013 I mean, anything except the absolute most old towers, which I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think you are talking about areas where you really don\u2019t have the same amount \u2013 you don\u2019t have the coverage today. These are the areas that the government is actually incentivizing through the RDOF and the \u2013 these large amounts of money to bring to these underserved areas. I think for the most part, where most of the carriers are today, where they have existing 3G and 4G coverage, we believe you are going to see 5G brought in the form of a mid-band spectrum.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And then one on margins which has obviously been very strong, anything that\u2019s going to revert post COVID or do you see kind of COVID-related extra cost about equal to any COVID-related savings?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No, we have not really had any type of \u2013 I mean our travel and entertainment expenses have been down. But I mean, when you look at the margins in the business, that\u2019s still such a small overall amount that for that to come back, I just don\u2019t see it, Nick. I don\u2019t think you are going to see anything material.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. If I can just squeeze in one housekeeping item, are you disclosing the PCS-Leap-Clearwire churn impact this quarter or are you stopping it?\nJeff Stoops: We basically stopped it because it\u2019s become largely immaterial. I believe that less than 0.3% of that same tower churn number, that\u2019s on the domestic side and lower than that on a consolidated basis.\nNick Del Deo: Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys.\nJeff Stoops: Okay.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one would be for Jeff. Is there any part of you that wonders if the American Tower MLA will affect the kind of cadence and tempo of the T-Mobile spend that you\u2019re anticipating that can come in 2021? And I guess my second question is for Brendan, obviously great deleveraging over the last year. I remember when you guys instituted a dividend that we were talking about as the fixed kind of dividend cost grew there was an inclination to bring leverage down below the historical targets, maybe even closer to 6. Is that now no longer the game plan? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, on the MLA, given what T-Mobile has committed to accomplish under the terms of the approval, I don\u2019t really think so, David. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that is going to impact SBA.\nBrendan Cavanagh: David on the...\nDavid Barden: Good to hear.\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the leverage plans, I mean, right now, given how low a percentage of our dividend represents, we don\u2019t think that it calls for any material reductions in leverage. I mean, we are naturally just organically delevering returning to a turn and a half every year just for EBITDA growth and the cash that we generate. So that \u2013 it keeps it up, requires us to be continuing to significantly invest in the business. So our goal would be to keep it up and continue to see opportunity to invest whether in new assets or share buybacks. But right now we don\u2019t have any intention to lower it materially. But I think over time as the dividend grows, if it becomes a much larger percentage of our free cash flow, then we would naturally see the leverage start to come down.\nJeff Stoops: Yes.\nDavid Barden: Okay.\nJeff Stoops: And keep in mind, we started that conversation when we were more regularly running at 7.5x than at 7x.\nDavid Barden: Great. Okay, great. Appreciate it guys.\nOperator: Thank you.  we will next go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Yes. Hey, guys. It sounds like you and your folks are doing well.\nJeff Stoops: All good, Ric. Thanks. How about you?\nRic Prentiss: Yes, doing well hunkered down. Couple of questions, if I could. Can you update us on the status of the FirstNet project in your areas?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. We continue to be active and we still have \u2013 we are probably about 50% to 55% of our sites and then with AT&T, I mean, upgraded to FirstNet. So still a ways to go.\nRic Prentiss: And do you expect to get to a 100%?\nJeff Stoops: Coming up quite, but much higher than where we are today.\nRic Prentiss: Yes, Okay. And are you having any discussions with potential C-band winners so they could run faster than the clearing process might suggest?\nJeff Stoops: We have had general conversations, which give basically for us and our customers they know that they can access their gear on our sites, relatively quickly. So \u2013 and the parameters are in place to allow them to do that. So we are one of the shortest pole in the tent and not the longest pole in the tent, Ric. So, I mean, there\u2019s just not a lot of need for that. I mean, we\u2019re here and ready to go and they all know that.\nRic Prentiss: Excellent. So last one for you and you might not have gotten this one before. I mean, we are getting questions about the new LEOs and RDOF auctions. Does that affect your customers at all, either new LEOs or fiber deeper?\nJeff Stoops: Well, the \u2013 we had a fair amount of leasing that occurred from the last auction that went out to try and bring service to the rural areas. So we are hopeful that the RDOF will have similar impact, but when you mean \u2013 what do you mean by impact? I mean, it\u2019s going to be generally, we believe, positive for incremental leasing.\nRic Prentiss: Yes. Do you get the question on wireless operators maybe being impacted by LEOs, from the fiber going deeper into the network?\nJeff Stoops: Well, I think it\u2019s around the edges. It will not be material but they are doing it themselves.\nRic Prentiss: Exactly. No, we just get that roughly a technology question. Thanks, guys. Stay well.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks for the question, guys. I was wondering if you can talk about, in general, industry expectations for \u201821 non-FDIC-specific. And the reason I asked is one of your peers provided a guidance range for new leasing activity next year that\u2019s essentially going to be flat versus here, which is somewhat disappointing. I thought that T-Mobile would then be returning. So I just wanted to get your take if that was a company-specific issue or reflective of maybe a broader industry trend for next year.\nJeff Stoops: Well, they actually gave out guidance for next year, which we are not going to do. But, basically T-Mobile is going to be busy, we believe, and the real issue as to what will ultimately drive the financial results, as opposed to the activity levels, but the financial results, will be how early in the year Dish and the C-band work really starts to get going. And that\u2019s about all we\u2019re going to say about 2021.\nDavid Guarino: Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears, maybe on the transaction market, I just wanted to get your thoughts on how that\u2019s evolved since the start of the year. It certainly feels like there is more eyeballs looking at the tower sector relative to a lot of other property types. Have you seen that translated into higher prices for towers that are being paid, and maybe something that exceeds even what you guys are willing to pay for assets?\nJeff Stoops: Well, it clearly has, which is why we will be expanding our portfolio by 5% which would be the first time in many years. There is a degree of interest in communications infrastructure, particularly towers, a lot of new players, and that has pushed pricing up to higher levels, levels such that we have taken a pass on a number of transactions.\nDavid Guarino: Would that be something you guys could quantify possibly in terms of just how much higher multiples are on specific deals and what you are comfortable with?\nJeff Stoops: No.\nDavid Guarino: Nothing specific but...\nJeff Stoops: No. I am not sure that\u2019s productive for our ability to compete and for others\u2019 ability to take notes and compete against us.\nDavid Guarino: Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: We will now go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. I am getting feedback on this line, hold on. I just have to try and go through it. So you basically indicated that there was a \u2013 I can\u2019t do this, you got to re-queue me in because I am getting too much feedback on my lines.\nJeff Stoops: Mark will recap to you, Walt.\nWalter Piecyk: Alright, thanks.\nOperator: Alright. We will go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Jeff, one for Brendan, if I could, Jeff, you mentioned in your remarks fourth quarter you are going to be pretty close to your long-term AFFO per share guidance of $10, is there any interesting outlining longer term targets for investors at some point in the near future? And if so, what might that look like? And then, Brendan, you brought up the T-Mobile cancellations, when specifically would those start to go into the run-rate? And then as we think about churn for next year, you had a 2% level and you are not breaking out sort of a one-time churn, so maybe can you help us understand where you are from like a run rate churn perspective annually? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Brandon, we feel pretty good about where things came out on that old $10 by \u201820 with the exception that the FX proved to be much more than the guide that we put out in 2016 anticipated. So we probably won\u2019t be doing that on a multiple year basis based on that experience. But everything else actually was extremely close and in many respects, we beat it quite handily. Yes, we will think about maybe some sub-components of that for maybe longer-term guidance, but to get right down to the AFFO per share, I think there are parts of that particularly FX that might make that not such a great idea. Obviously, it\u2019s not something we can control. Brendan?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon. So on the churn, as it relates to the T-Mobile churn that I mentioned earlier, which is basically Sprint churn, what we have received notifications on, as I mentioned, is about $4 million, $4.5 million, maybe $5 million of impact. And that would be the impact pretty much for next year. Beyond that, we have not received any notifications. If we were to look at that and incorporate what might happen, we are still looking at a relatively small amount for next year, only about 7% of the revenue in total, which includes the amount of time, just mentioned from Sprint is at risk of churn for next year and that\u2019s highly unlikely to be at that full amount. So we don\u2019t expect \u2013 we will give you, obviously, more detail when we get to giving guidance next quarter. We will have a lot more information at that point, but that\u2019s the impact of that. As it relates to the churn as a whole, from a run rate standpoint, we were at \u2013 from a domestic level, this quarter, we reported same tower churn of 2.2%. I mentioned earlier that about 0.3% or so of that is vestiges of natural leasing to Clearwire. So just under 2%, that\u2019s probably about the range that we will see over the course of the next year. There is a variety of things in there. We have talked about in the past, on a couple of calls, a lot of miscellaneous items including some number on air stuff that some of our customers have cleaned up, some smaller customers that have modified some of their older technology and based on what we have seen already this year, its impact to next year should keep us somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a normal basis and then we will see what happens with Sprint.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thank you.\nMark DeRussy: Rich, we have time for one more call.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go to the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nSpencer Kurn: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to just revisit amendment pricing. Historically, I would only thought of higher frequency spectrum having smaller antennas, which would typically command the lower amendment rate, but at the same time, minor antennas, I have heard, are a lot bigger. So I would just want to get your thoughts on how amendment price daily is sort of trending as you see more minor antennas being deployed? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I mean it\u2019s trending higher, but not trending differently than it has historically based on changes in weight and size. So it has been basically logical in terms of the way it has progressed which is good because it\u2019s expected and it\u2019s consistent with at least the way we have conducted ourselves with our customers over time.\nSpencer Kurn: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, as we have seen C-RAN being deployed and base stations being pulled into data centers, it doesn\u2019t seem like we have seen a big impact on pricing of towers. But I was just curious of your thoughts on how big of an impact you have actually seen and whether that\u2019s been sort of entirely offset by new antennas filling up on towers as the C-RAN transition has played out?\nJeff Stoops: Yes, we have not really seen much impact at all and I really don\u2019t think we will, because at the end of the day, we are a radio and antenna location business, that is where we got the \u2013 we provided the height and the location and the entitlements and whether the computer is there at the bottom of the tower or somewhere else, it doesn\u2019t really matter as much as the ability to host the radio-only antennas.\nSpencer Kurn: Great. Thanks again.\nMark DeRussy: So we want to thank everybody for joining us on this call and we look forward to our next call when we report our fourth quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. We had another strong financial performance in the third quarter. We produced leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share that were all ahead of both our expectations and consensus expectations. The year has developed almost exactly as we predicted it would on our last earnings call. U.S. customer activity has increased due to T-Mobile activity increasing post merger. International business remained stable to improving, but still challenged due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in those markets, and the capital markets remained very friendly to our company. Because we see further increased U.S. leasing activity in the future over 2020 levels, at a time where international markets recover from today's COVID-19 challenges, we continue to invest capital in both portfolio growth and by repurchasing our stock which investments, we believe will help fuel future growth in AFFO per share and dividends per share. I don't think materially. I think we will see a period of time, though, in 2021, before we will see the highest levels of activity we expect, particularly with respect to the C-band, because that's going to take a little bit of time. But I don't know, I mean, of course, anything can happen, but I don't see signs today that T-Mobile going one way and the other two are going in the opposite direction. Well, we're seeing it happen today because we're seeing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum being deployed today. And, I mean, that is the preferred way, my understanding, that is the preferred way and the most efficient way to get the most out of the mid-band spectrum for 5G. Well, we didn't see COVID, and we didn't see the \u2013 we did not see the level of the FX adjustment, which I think is, in large part, due to. But what we have seen is a steady currency \u2013 constant currency adjusted, very good demand, Phil, for those assets, and we think over time and with some improvement in those COVID conditions, we're going to see tremendous improvement in the numbers coming out of Brazil. But I would certainly be telling you, Phil, if we foresaw everything that has gone on in Brazil this year back in December. Yes, there is. I mean, if you were to strip back \u2013 I mean, if you look at the demand and the growth rates that Brendan talked about and you see in our numbers on a constant currency basis, we're very pleased with where things are. And that's still on a year and in an environment where these customers have pulled back materially in their CapEx in response to COVID. And they basically said that, look, this is temporary, and we're going to need to spend more money coming out of this thing. So we're very \u2013 we continue to be very happy with our Brazilian operations. We don't really have any of the , Simon. What we have are just straight Sprint leases that are of a more regular Sprint network deployment that have various termination dates over time and we're always open to discussions. In terms of Cable, we do have Cable, lot of demand for some of our tower space. I don't know that Cable will ever have a desire to mount a \u2013 or the spectrum ability to mount a greenfield nationwide build out the way the other four will have. But we certainly do see some incremental demand and benefit from their spectrum holds. You take the first one I will take the second one. Yes and how soon we start seeing next year, which frankly, we just don't know yet today the benefits that will come from Dish really digging in and starting to deploy and the C-band deployments. So, on the \u2013 Colby, the 5% to 10% that continues to be the goal, we are not going to hit it this year. If you add this year and last year, we will have averaged greater than 5%, but that's not going to be how we target things. We just didn't see the number of opportunities this year that we thought made sense from a pricing perspective. There were enough opportunities out there to hit those numbers. I believe there will continue to be enough opportunities out there. But for us, it's not only the number, it's the price and it's the quality. Unless it all comes together in the right way, we're not going to buy stuff just to buy stuff and that's where we are this year. But I don't think this is indicative that there is not going to be 5% to 10% next year. Yes. And on the data center, Mike, we've now got two, and the purpose is to understand the data center business, data center model, so that we can be in a position when the opportunity is right to know whether we're going to be operators of many data centers on our cell sites or something less, landlords or maybe something in between. What we've learned so far is that it is definitely a different sales business, different customers, but that there are a number of different applications and needs where by having a larger regional data center that is well connected with fiber, lot of interconnect, a lot of meet-me type rooms there, that's an attractive offering to folks who may want to also have smaller installations at the tower site. We call that the hub-and-spoke theory. At the end of the day, for all of this to make sense, it has to be on our land at the tower site. That's what this is all about. It's not separately getting into an unconnected data center business. But for us to understand how to maximize that, we thought that some experience with and kind of experimentation with these two data centers, one in Chicago, one in Jacksonville and Jacksonville, it has also some undersea cable connections, will give us the right experience and skill set. So, more on that as it comes, it's not going to be material to our financial results any time for the next several years. But it could be a key to really unlocking some value and frankly, land that we've already kind of got the sunk cost and sunk investment in. So it's something that we're excited about over the long term. Yes, so far the delta \u2013 it's more of a regional Tier 2, Tier 3 markets for the hubs. So it could be more rather than less, but you got to have the spokes side of things more developed out for this to \u2013 for me to be able to sit and tell you that there's going to be more than two months. That's why we have the two to prove out now the spokes side of things, and these are both areas where we have a fair number of tower sites to do all kinds of different expected business models, but if there are enough tower sites that connect and makes sense, then you've got the creation of another hub opportunity and whether that needs to be owned or partnered, it doesn't have to be more than the other. Well, I mean, you kind of answered it for me. You really won't know until the auctions are done and what got taken by who and where. But one of the benefits of giving the 2020 outlook when we give it is, we hope to have some of that information by then. So we will look at that and bring in whatever we can from the results and be able to factor that into our outlook. I do believe a large part of \u2013 at least the early feelings will be based on the dollar spent and the belief that the folks who spend the large dollars and folks have indicated that they are looking to do that. They will be looking to deploy as quickly as they can. So that is kind of how we are going to triangulate things. But it is not going to be \u2013 it is hard for me to say with specificity now, without knowing the first thing about who won what and where. Yes, I think the spectrum clearing is going to go faster than folks think, just like it did on the TV spectrum. Some of it's going to go faster, some of it may not. There is every incentive for the folks who win that spectrum for purchasing, I guess, because they are purchasing it, in some cases, arguably to stay competitive with a rapidly deploying T-Mobile to get things done very quickly. And I think that it's going to bode well for us and our industry. Yes, I suspect there will be some, but I think in large part where they have \u2013 I mean, anything except the absolute most old towers, which I don't think \u2013 I think you are talking about areas where you really don't have the same amount \u2013 you don't have the coverage today. These are the areas that the government is actually incentivizing through the RDOF and the \u2013 these large amounts of money to bring to these underserved areas. I think for the most part, where most of the carriers are today, where they have existing 3G and 4G coverage, we believe you are going to see 5G brought in the form of a mid-band spectrum. We basically stopped it because it's become largely immaterial. I believe that less than 0.3% of that same tower churn number, that's on the domestic side and lower than that on a consolidated basis. Okay. Yes, on the MLA, given what T-Mobile has committed to accomplish under the terms of the approval, I don't really think so, David. I don't think there's anything that is going to impact SBA. Yes. And keep in mind, we started that conversation when we were more regularly running at 7.5x than at 7x. All good, Ric. Thanks. How about you? Yes. We continue to be active and we still have \u2013 we are probably about 50% to 55% of our sites and then with AT&T, I mean, upgraded to FirstNet. So still a ways to go. Coming up quite, but much higher than where we are today. We have had general conversations, which give basically for us and our customers they know that they can access their gear on our sites, relatively quickly. So \u2013 and the parameters are in place to allow them to do that. So we are one of the shortest pole in the tent and not the longest pole in the tent, Ric. So, I mean, there's just not a lot of need for that. I mean, we're here and ready to go and they all know that. Well, the \u2013 we had a fair amount of leasing that occurred from the last auction that went out to try and bring service to the rural areas. So we are hopeful that the RDOF will have similar impact, but when you mean \u2013 what do you mean by impact? I mean, it's going to be generally, we believe, positive for incremental leasing.

There is a degree of interest in communications infrastructure, particularly towers, a lot of new players, and that has pushed pricing up to higher levels, levels such that we have taken a pass on a number of transactions.

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA once again had very strong results in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations in all key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $486.8 million and cash site leasing revenues were $486.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $1 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the third quarter. They were again however a significant headwind on comparison to the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $20.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.1% over the third quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6.0%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year, was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter increased over the first half of 2020 levels, but remains below levels we were seeing in the year ago period. The sequential increase in domestic new bookings was driven primarily by increased activity with T-Mobile. Based on conversations with our customers and continued growth in our domestic application backlog, we anticipate seeing this activity continue to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2012. During the third quarter, amendment activity remained the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed-up domestic leasing revenue coming 80% from amendments, and 20% from new leases. The Big 3 carriers represented 83% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.1%, including 0.4% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. Our international leasing activity was up modestly over first half 2020 levels, but still remains impacted by continued COVID-related spending reductions by our customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease up. Gross same tower organic growth in Brazil was 9% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 86% of consolidated cash site leasing fee revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollars denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass through expenses. Yes, I mean, it's our desire to stay within that target range. We're at the low end of it now. It's \u2013 in terms of the share buybacks and the asset acquisitions, it's really a matter of being opportunistic around what's available to us at a given time. So we're there today, largely through share buybacks in the third quarter and we've done some already in the fourth quarter. So you should expect we'll be somewhere around the same range going forward. Yes, we \u2013 so we have seen a little bit of churn notifications from T-Mobile, thus far, around 100 leases or so. That is relatively small, probably in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of its impact for next year. When you look at our overall churn end date, though, in terms of the overlap in particular, we have almost 4 years left on average for the Sprint leases that are on \u2013 sorry, for T-Mobile it is, and \u2013 but when you look at the specific dates, most of it is out about 5 to 6 years. So we expect that we're going to start seeing that stuff heavily weighted toward the back end. Okay. Yes, Colby, so on the churn question, most \u2013 based on the way that it works when we give those same tower growth rates, it's usually driven mostly by stuff that's happening this year and into the first part of next year. So a lot of that is unknown. So I don't expect the churn to be materially higher, although there is some potential for some additional notes. We're not ready to give \u201821 numbers yet. And I think when we give them, we'll have a little bit better view on whether there is certain plans from T-Mobile around some of that churn. But the overall growth rates will also be influenced by the activity levels in terms of new leasing activity this year as well, so  until next quarter to get the actual numbers. But what's happening today and the slowdown we saw in the first part of the year, this year, will have some impact on next year's same tower growth numbers because it is a trailing indicator. On the book to bill, it's typically 6 to 12 months. It can vary a little bit depending on the mix amendments and the type of activity that's been done by the carriers, but I would say we're seeing it stretch out a little bit longer than it has in the past. I think there's so many major projects going on in particular with T-Mobile that the delayed maintenance are a little bit longer than they happened in the past, but 6 to 12 months is the typical range. No, we have not really had any type of \u2013 I mean our travel and entertainment expenses have been down. But I mean, when you look at the margins in the business, that's still such a small overall amount that for that to come back, I just don't see it, Nick. I don't think you are going to see anything material. David on the... On the leverage plans, I mean, right now, given how low a percentage of our dividend represents, we don't think that it calls for any material reductions in leverage. I mean, we are naturally just organically delevering returning to a turn and a half every year just for EBITDA growth and the cash that we generate. So that \u2013 it keeps it up, requires us to be continuing to significantly invest in the business. So our goal would be to keep it up and continue to see opportunity to invest whether in new assets or share buybacks. But right now we don't have any intention to lower it materially. But I think over time as the dividend grows, if it becomes a much larger percentage of our free cash flow, then we would naturally see the leverage start to come down. Yes, Brandon. So on the churn, as it relates to the T-Mobile churn that I mentioned earlier, which is basically Sprint churn, what we have received notifications on, as I mentioned, is about $4 million, $4.5 million, maybe $5 million of impact. And that would be the impact pretty much for next year. Beyond that, we have not received any notifications. If we were to look at that and incorporate what might happen, we are still looking at a relatively small amount for next year, only about 7% of the revenue in total, which includes the amount of time, just mentioned from Sprint is at risk of churn for next year and that's highly unlikely to be at that full amount. So we don't expect \u2013 we will give you, obviously, more detail when we get to giving guidance next quarter. We will have a lot more information at that point, but that's the impact of that. As it relates to the churn as a whole, from a run rate standpoint, we were at \u2013 from a domestic level, this quarter, we reported same tower churn of 2.2%. I mentioned earlier that about 0.3% or so of that is vestiges of natural leasing to Clearwire. So just under 2%, that's probably about the range that we will see over the course of the next year. There is a variety of things in there. We have talked about in the past, on a couple of calls, a lot of miscellaneous items including some number on air stuff that some of our customers have cleaned up, some smaller customers that have modified some of their older technology and based on what we have seen already this year, its impact to next year should keep us somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a normal basis and then we will see what happens with Sprint."

We will have an opportunity for question-and-answer session later on. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference will be recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, the Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks Nick. Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 3rd, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA produced another solid performance during the second quarter notwithstanding continued hardship and uncertainty for many across all of our markets due to COVID-19. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $482.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $482.1 million. Foreign exchange rate were a $1.3 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the second quarter. They were, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $21.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5% over the second quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.9%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 6.7% on a gross basis and 4.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn, 0.5% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter, was again slower than a year ago period and remain similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019. The measured pace of new bookings in the quarter was primarily due to a slower restart than we anticipated by T-Mobile following the closing of their merger with Sprint, while our other domestic customers were steady. However, as we have begun the third quarter, we have seen a meaningful increase in application activity from T-Mobile that we expect to drive increased domestic organic bookings in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. During the second quarter, amendment activity was again the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 69% from amendments and 31% from new leases. The big three carriers represented 70% of total incremental provisional domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We again have a nice contribution to domestic leasing activity from some cap to funded rural broadband providers. As I mentioned a moment ago, our domestic application backlog has started to grow nicely, which portends well for a steadily increasing pace of new bookings during the second half of the year. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.8%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.3% on a gross basis. We continue to see leasing activity internationally, but was a little slower overall in prior periods due to COVID-related spending reductions by customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.4% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, 86.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.9% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $394.1 million. Our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.3% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 71.5%, also industry leading and was 91.1% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $368.8 million. Our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.8% in the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 77.1%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. Our second quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were again both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the second quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.29, an increase of 9.6% over the second quarter of 2019 and a 14.8% increase on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 16 communication sites for $13.4 million and building a total of 79 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased 25 communication sites and one data center for an aggregate price of $61.6 million and we have agreed to purchase 100 additional sites for an aggregate price of $42 million. We anticipate closing on a majority of these sites by the end of the year. The data center is located in Jacksonville, Florida and will allow us to continue to expand our knowledge of the data center business and will, we believe, be ultimately critical to maximizing our edge data center offerings as we continue to develop our strategy and invest in the provision of edge data centers located at our existing communication sites. Jeff will discuss in further detail in a moment. We also continue to invest in the lands under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $12.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years. In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020 providing increases in all key metrics. Outperformance against our second quarter foreign currency exchange assumptions and slight improvements in forecasted FX rates for the balance of the year have partially contributed to our increased outlook. Increases due to acquisitions and better than anticipated cash basis revenue collections offset by modestly lower expected contributions from new leasing activity represented the rest of the increase in our full-year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a slower start to new revenue bookings this year than we had previously expected, which ultimately slightly delayed by 90 days to 120 days, the timing of new revenue growth from organic lease-up. However, given our increasing application backlog, our recent customer conversations and the significant network deployment obligations of some of our customers, we expect this timing delay to be just that, a timing delay. We anticipate growth in domestic bookings in each of the next two quarters and into 2021. I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. We ended the second quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt and $10.2 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9 times, which is down one-tenth of a turn since last quarter. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.9 times. On May 26th, we issued an additional $500 million of senior unsecured notes as an add-on to our $1 billion issuance completed in February of this year. These new notes were issued at 99.5% of par value and similar to their original issue, they have a fixed interest rate coupon of 3.875% and a maturity date of February 14th, 2027. The net proceeds of this issuance were used to repay the entire balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have no outstanding balance under our revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, on July 14th, through a trust, we issued $750 million of 1.884% senior tower -- Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 9th, 2026 and $600 million of 2.328% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11th, 2028. The aggregate $1.35 billion of tower securities have a blended interest rate of 2.081% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 6.4 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2015-1C and the 2016-1C Tower Securities, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. The pro-rated -- I'm sorry, the pro forma weighted interest -- weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3.5%, and our weighted average maturity is approximately four and a half years. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and as of today, we have $424.3 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at June 30th, 2020 are 111.9 million compared to 113.1 million at June 30th, 2019, a reduction of 1.1%. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announce that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent third quarter dividend of $0.465 per share payable on September 22nd, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 25th, 2020. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another solid one for SBA, both financially and operationally. We again produced leasing revenue, TCF, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO that were well ahead of our expectations. Our TCF and adjusted EBITDA margins were once again a high bar as the highest in our company's history and our AFFO per share grew 14.8% on a constant currency basis over the second quarter of last year. Our business remains healthy and strong. While we greatly appreciate our position in an essential mission-critical business, we recognize that many people are suffering from the continuing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. When we first reported our first quarter results three months ago, we did not expect so many of the markets in which we operate to still be deep in the fight against the virus at this time. While I'm happy with our performance, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our team members, customers, suppliers, and other members of the SBA family. At SBA, most of our offices have only been open to essential team members for the last four and a half months and we have figured out how to adjust to being a largely remote workforce. We've had a relatively small percentage of our global team members test positive for the virus and we are thankful that they're all doing okay. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and level of performance by our team members during these very challenging times, serving our customers and our communities. We have learned how to operate safely in this environment and we will continue to do so. In the U.S., the virus has had very little impact on our operational results. Things continue to be good, but as you heard from Brendan earlier, the level of domestic operational activity or new bookings during the quarter was at a similar level to the first quarter, and this is definitely lower than we expected a few months ago, primarily due to a slower start than we had anticipated from T-Mobile after the closing of their merger with Sprint. And we don't really see this as COVID-related, but T-Mobile choosing to initially focus on closing the Boost deal with Dish, integrating workforces, and delivering on synergies. In typical T-Mobile fashion, they seemed to have acted quickly, decisively, and thoughtfully and now have the organization they want in place to turn full attention to their network development needs and obligations. Although our timing was off by a quarter or so on when we initially thought we would see a material increase to domestic leasing activity, the anticipated increases in our application backlogs have now started, providing us confidence and steadily increasing bookings during the second half of 2020. And increased bookings will, of course, drive increased organic revenue growth in the periods following these bookings. We are excited about our prospects because we believe that we have now just begun the necessary phase of increased capital investment in macro networks in order to offer true 5G service. T-Mobile has a lot to do to meet their required 5G coverage goals; including upgrading the majority of their sites with either 2.5 gigahertz or 600 megahertz spectrum and we expect to be a valued partner to them in meeting their build-out objectives. In addition to T-Mobile, our other major domestic customers all have significant projects in process or ahead of them. AT&T recently launched true 5G service on low-band spectrum in a number of markets and we expect both AT&T and Verizon, and many others to be active in the current CBRS auction and particularly, AT&T and Verizon to be active in the C-band auction scheduled for later this year, which we believe will be a key component of future 5G networks and will require new equipment at many of their existing macro sites. In addition, our discussions with Dish have been very constructive and we anticipate that they will be actively engaged in building out a nationwide 5G network over a multi-year period. The fact patterns are setting up very well for a busy domestic leasing and services environment for the next several years. Internationally, we saw solid demand in most of our markets. However, we do believe there will be greater impact in our Latin American and South African markets than in the U.S. from the COVID-19 crisis. Some of our larger international customers have faced challenge economies and even government-required payment deferrals from their customers. As a result, some of our international customers have reduced anticipated capital expenditures and network expansion investment, while they assess the length and severity of the pandemic in each of their markets. We view these current reductions as temporary. Wireless is almost always the primary source of broadband services in these markets. And we believe that as economic conditions improve, wireless capital spending will increase considerably. In our largest international market, Brazil, we're watching closely the recent announcements from our wireless carrier customer, Oi, regarding their plans to divest their mobile wireless assets. A consortium of the other three largest carriers in the market have expressed interest and submitted the most recent bid on these assets, although much needs to occur before any transaction can be consummated. Oi mobile represents 37.6% of our total Brazil cash leasing revenue and 3% of our total overall cash leasing revenue. Oi mobile's largest portfolio-wide carrier overlap is with Telefonica in Brazil with Oi's revenue on those overlap sites representing less than 1% of our total overall cash leasing revenue, although any transaction would likely present much less overlap exposure as the three acquiring carriers would be expected for regulatory reasons to split up Oi's assets based on each carrier's geographic area of greatest need. Our Oi mobile leases also have an average remaining non-cancellable term of eight years. We continue to believe our long-term prospects in Brazil will be bolstered by a shift from four major carriers to just three stronger carriers competing on the basis of network quality. We expect the resolution of Oi's future will be a positive step toward an increased growth cycle in Brazil and improved wireless carrier health. We continue to favor investing in macro towers, including internationally over other types of investments. Over the years, we feel we have proven very adept at managing the risk of international investments versus the benefits of faster growth, higher targeted returns, and more opportunities for investment. At the end of the second quarter, we enjoyed industry leading international tower cash flow margins and our most mature international investments are generating attractive returns well above our cost of capital with much growth still ahead. We are very pleased. In addition to macro towers, we have continued to pursue other opportunities to create value around our sites with a focus on leveraging those assets, strengthening core revenue streams, accessing large new customers, and investing in strategic technology. One of the areas of growth we are pursuing is SBA Edge, where we are focused on using our existing tower assets to offer highly distributed local sites for edge data centers with the potential to provide low latency connectivity to wireless networks. We currently have over 8,000 pre-qualified tower sites in the U.S. as locations where we can situate an edge data center with access to secure space, power and fiber. These tower edge data centers will provide co-location options for customers computing infrastructure with connectivity to a larger metro data center for internet for private network connectivity. In order to support this business, we have deployed an edge data center at our tower site in Foxborough, Massachusetts and we have also made investments in larger more centralized data centers that we believe will act as edge hubs or intermediate aggregation points for compute and storage. Last year, we added a data center, our first in West Chicago, and just recently we acquired our second data center called Jacksonville's Network Access Point, or JaxNAP for short, located in Jacksonville, Florida. JaxNAP is 280,000-square foot 14 megawatt facility providing regional co-location and interconnection services to a variety of customers, including sub-sea cable telecommunications companies and approximately 20 fiber providers, all accessing and sharing the property. JaxNAP will allow us to develop deeper data center capabilities and further enhance our tower edge data center value proposition through increased interconnection and operational knowledge. We're excited about the potential of this value-added business line and are in discussions with a number of interested parties about a range of our expanding capabilities in this area. As we've said many times, however, for this new product offering to ever be material for SBA, a real 5G ecosystem needs to develop. Based on the increasing number of conversations we're having, we are optimistic that this will happen in the years to come. Moving now to our balance sheet, we were able to seize on favorable capital market conditions over the last couple of months to reduce our weighted average cost of debt and extend our maturities. We currently have no debt maturities until 2022 and we have higher liquidity than at any time in our history, including our fully available undrawn $1.25 billion revolver. In July, we issued $1.35 billion of securities in the securitization market, including $750 million of 5.5-year paper at fixed rate of 1.88%, the lowest fixed price debt in our history. Our June 30th leverage was 6.9 times, a level I'm very comfortable with and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend. We did not repurchase any shares of stock in the second quarter; because we were targeting some of the volatility we took advantage of in the first quarter. We didn't get it, but stock repurchases remain a critical part of our value creation strategy. We announced today our dividend for the third quarter at a level of 26% above our third quarter dividend last year. Our dividend, however, remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us the opportunity to continue investing in exclusive multi-tenant assets producing returns well above our cost of capital. SBA's adept use of leverage throughout our history has truly differentiated us from our peers to the clear benefit of you, our equity holders. It was another solid quarter in a very challenging time. I want to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We expect to stay very busy, serving our customers and our communities and we look forward to a solid and even better second half of the year. And with that, Nick, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Rick -- I'm sorry, Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRichard Prentiss: Hi. Hey, guys.\nMark DeRussy: Hey, Rick.\nRichard Prentiss: Glad to hear you and your employees and families are making it through these difficult times okay. A couple of questions, first, on the updated guidance. Brendan, I think you mentioned some of the increase was in the other category from the waterfall chart. Was that revenue collections or what was that, I think in the U.S. $5 million of the guidance increase was \"from other\"?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Rick. That's a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes things like some higher cash basis holdover fees that we received some -- a little bit higher on the structural augmentation, amortization and even some back-filling or out-of-period stuff. So, a lot of that was outperformance in the second quarter and a little bit of that is expected outperformance for the balance of the year. Rick?\nRichard Prentiss: Hey, can you hear me okay?\nMark DeRussy: Yes.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, now we can.\nRichard Prentiss: Sorry about that. Do you still expect to give guidance for 2021 on your fourth quarter call? I know some companies giving on third quarter call. I was wondering what your thought is on 2021.\nJeffrey Stoops: We will continue the same schedule.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And when we think of the new T-Mobile, glad to hear activity is picking up. As we think about the potential for the Sprint decommissioning concept, do you have a preference as far as getting paid up front, being paid over time, being paid on the current schedule? And how do you think T-Mobile thinks about what their preference would be on how to resolve the Sprint decommissioning into their integration?\nJeffrey Stoops: It's interesting. We've had -- there are two schools of thought among our shareholders. There is the spread it out evenly approach and there is the maximize the NPV approach or the maximize-out-the-returns over time. And I don't want to get too far into how things will go. That will be a one or two or perhaps something of that in the middle. In terms of T-Mobile, I mean they're smart guys. They're looking for the best results that will be a mix of financial certainty, financial results, speed and all the things that they need to do to really play for the big picture, which is the race to be ubiquitous 5G.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And on the Dish side, you mentioned you guys are having talks obviously looking forward to them getting actively engaged. Any gating factors from your side as far as when to ramp up the efforts with Dish? Do they need the funding in place or just as you think about Dish becoming a more meaningful 5G lease or what are you looking for to occur?\nJeffrey Stoops: We are here and ready to go for Dish. We've worked with them for years now. They're a very good customer and when they say they're ready to go, we are ready to go for them.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay, very good. Well, again, I hope you guys stay well in these difficult times. Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks Rick.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. A question on the international activity, you lowered the guidance a little bit, but you mentioned that as we exit the year, there is a slowdown in activity, especially in LatAm. Do you think the current slowdown will impact next year's growth? And how -- just generally, how would you think about international growth next year? And just a follow-up on T-Mobile. How can we reconcile the slower start you saw at T-Mobile and commentary from them that they're accelerating the build-out of 2.500 towers? Do you think that's more of a function of maybe activity on rooftops or the replacing our existing 2.5 equipments? And when they're doing that, is there an upside for you? Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I don't think that commentary is inconsistent at all with what we're seeing now in terms of increasing applications and backlogs. So I would say that that's consistent. In terms of international, I think given the types of populations that are being served in South America and South Africa. I think, Batya, you're going to -- it's going to be largely dependent on where the virus is and what stages of lockdown and economic activity you're going to see in those markets.\nBatya Levi: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. You talked about some good activity from some of the CAF II builds. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what opportunity you see from the RF process. It seems like there is plenty of people looking at fixed wireless solutions there? What do you see in that opportunity there? And then any color you could give us on with the T-Mobile applications. What sort of opportunities on amendments putting 2.5 on T-Mo towers or putting the lower-band spectrum on the Sprint towers, if you got a sense of what sort of dollars that's coming out at? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. We do, but we're not going to get into that specifically, Simon. That's -- we don't do that.\nSimon Flannery: Is it in line with your expectations?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, I mean, what people should take from our commentary is everything is pretty much exactly like we thought. It's just 90 days to 120 days behind where we thought it would be. And then in terms of your first question was, yes, we do expect opportunities to come out of that. I mean, fixed wireless, it's got -- in certain areas; it's going to be better for macro sites than others. I mean, some of the applications are more existing poles and not necessarily towers as much as some of the cash stuff was. But we do see opportunities there. We think that there is going to be some added benefit from there. And all of these programs, which this unfortunate COVID-19 thing, so much highlights the need for increased spending and broadband rural connectivity. We will see some incremental benefits from that in the years to come.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could focus a little bit on the edge projects that you were mentioning in the initiatives and a couple of questions there. First, if you could talk about the types of learnings that you're looking to extract from the data centers that you've acquired and how that's helping you frame the edge opportunity? And then the second thing is with the trial that you have in Massachusetts, as well as some of the sites that you've been prepping for the opportunity. How are you thinking about what you can monetize the land for the opportunity for relative to what you get in terms of revenue per tower today? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, that's -- your last question, Mike, is really the business model choice that needs to be made, which is one of -- there is basically three options for us, which is to be just the basic landlord and run out the pad and the -- basically the improvements and the connections. The second will be to take the middle ground and own the shell and the infrastructure, but let somebody else own the active electronics and operate them; and then the third is run the whole thing. And that's really what the data center ownership and operation is designed to allow us to when it really comes time to make that decision to be in a position to do. The other thing that we have learned is that for the folks who will be at -- and this we've learned since over the last year and it was one of the impetuses behind this recent -- our second data center purchase, is that for all the folks who are going to be customers at the edge, at the cell site, they all need and will be coming from some other larger data center repository. So, the -- it's really quite interesting how the connectivity needs to work where large storage goes to moderate size and then ultimately out to the edge, so the ultimate edge. So, the data center connections to the ultimate edge are going to be very important, and that's part of what we're working on here as well. And we want to make sure we understand and have that capability operationally down. And whether in 10 years we own these data centers, more or less, I can't tell you, but we will understand what the relationships are between the absolute edge, which is what ultimately will be our forte and the data center aggregation points along the way that will be necessary to make it all work.\nOperator: Our next question then will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Looking at your investments, combination of M&A and buybacks year-to-date, I guess relative to what you typically spend in the year, it seems like you're pretty far off the typical pace. I guess, how do you envision the back half of the year playing out? Do you see enough potential M&A to get you where you want to be? Would you anticipate stepping on the buybacks if that doesn't present itself or are you comfortable letting the leverage continue to come down a bit? And then secondly, as it relates to Oi, and maybe just international more broadly, just curious if you had to take any notable bad debt reserves in the quarter that may have impacted EBITDA? And then secondly, I guess as part of that, are you still getting payment from them right now? Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: Brendan, I'm going to let you handle the Oi stuff. Colby, we'd rather not let leverage continue to come down, especially given the cost at which we're accessing debt and the growth that we have. We'd rather be out investing in our -- in new assets first and portfolio growth second. But we're not going to do stupid expenditures. I mean, that's always been the motto and the course of action here. So, there is a lot of things out there that we continue to look at and will be looking at, certainly enough to meet our minimum 5% portfolio growth. We certainly have the liquidity more than plenty there to accomplish that. And it is our goal and belief that we will get there, but it's got to be the right stuff.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And Colby, on --\nColby Synesael: So, you think that you would -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, so you think you'll still hit the 5% minimum of portfolio growth, but beyond that in terms of whether it's M&A or buybacks, I guess, regarding the leverage come down--\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, we're going to hard. We're going to work hard to do that. That's certainly our first choice. I don't have it in the bag today.\nColby Synesael: Okay.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Colby, on your question with regard to Oi, first of all, in terms of bad debt reserves, we didn't book any material bad debt reserves in the second quarter. And then from a getting paid standpoint, they continue to pay us the full amount that they owe us. So, no issues there.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, your peers have spent a lot of time talking about returns by segment this quarter. And Jeff, you briefly alluded to international return in your prepared remarks. I thought I'd ask you the same. You disclose in ROIC calculation in your supplemental package, what would the domestic versus international split look like? And maybe more importantly, what do you think those numbers would look like when comparing assets that have comparable levels of maturity?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Hey, Nick. It's Brendan. So, from a ROIC standpoint, we're not breaking out that information specifically, given the different maturity levels of those portfolios. But I can tell you some general directional information about it, which is -- some of it may be obvious, which is that the domestic ROIC is obviously higher than the consolidated 10.2% number that we put out, while the international was lower. But some of our more mature international markets like in Central America have current ROICs that are in the high-single digits. And in the case of certain countries like Panama actually exceed the U.S. So, the more mature markets that we've been in have been -- performed very, very well. The less mature South American markets typically have ROICs that are in the mid-single digits. We've had obviously some FX headwinds that have weighed on the Brazil numbers a little bit. But on a constant currency basis, that's up north of 9%. So, we expect, as we kind of get into a little bit more normalized time period in terms of currency, that, that number will actually show very well. So it's all gone pretty well in our markets that we've been in for a while.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that's great. Now, turning to Oi, I think you noted that you have an 8-year average contract term with them.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes.\nNick Del Deo: If I'm not mistaken, that's a blend of some with very long terms and maybe some with more typical terms. Is that correct that it's kind of a barbell distribution? And if so, can you describe kind of what each end looks like?\nBrendan Cavanagh: For Oi?\nNick Del Deo: Yes.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So some of -- almost all of the Oi leases are leases that we acquired through leaseback scenarios. They average varying terms, but they're all quite long. So when you look at Oi mobile as a whole, the average remaining term is a little over eight years on those leases. And then we have some Oi fixed wireline leases as well that are actually north of 25 years. So, between the two, it's an extensive long time left.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Got it. And if I could sort of one last quick one to you, Brendan.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, let me just be clear.\nNick Del Deo: Sure.\nJeffrey Stoops: That eight years was the mobile. We didn't even -- I mean, we didn't even work into that calculation, the wireline.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then lastly, margins were very strong this quarter. Anything we should be aware of that's kind of one-time or one-time-ish in nature, like that were travel expenses or anything like that?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, I mean, we were slightly better. I mean, you're looking at $1 million or so in the quarter of probably reduced SG&A due to things like that, but it's not overly material.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes. Just a little bit of color, it sounded like there has been a fair amount of purchase activity in the quarter and subsequent to the quarter. Maybe just kind of a little color on where those tower assets were focused and what was compelling about the purchase. And then just a follow-up, you haven't really mentioned indoor DAS. So just curious of any changes in direction or momentum there. Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: The towers, well, I mean, I'd like to say that was a lot but it really wasn't. Most of that was in the US and they were healthy multiples, because they were very high quality assets. I mean, there still continues to be a strong bid, which goes back to the exchange I had with Colby about that's where we want to be. But that's -- you have to be very careful because prices continue to be challenging and not every tower is created equal. And your -- I'm sorry, your second question, Tim?\nTim Long: Just on indoor DAS.\nJeffrey Stoops: Indoor. Yes, we continue to move along in that area and add a couple properties every quarter, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a steady growing business. And it's a much more difficult business in many respects, because it is absolutely a custom one asset at a time business. But we are very encouraged by what's going on in the CBRS auction, I think it topped $1 billion today and that means there is, from what I understand, wide interest. And I think that's going to be very good for that business.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just maybe, Brendan, I think I heard you say that there is a 2.2% domestic churn rate, 50 basis points of that was Leap/Metro stuff. Could you kind of elaborate on what the other churn is being driven by? Is it government or municipalities or M&A? And kind of historically it's been closer to 1%, 1.5% as kind of the core churn rate. If you could kind of elaborate on where you see that going. And then the second piece is on Dish, just as you kind of look out, it sounded optimistic on Dish. The last time, I think third quarter last year; we talked about Dish at some length. It was a lot on the services side. Is that kind of how you see the relationship beginning and then it kind of rolls into the macro side, maybe down the road? Some help there would be helpful too. Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: David, on the churn, just as a point of clarification, obviously those percentages are same-tower percentages, so they're representative of a trailing 12-month period. I think you saw a little bit of a step-up in that a couple of quarters ago. And it's really the same thing that's kind of in there that's affecting. So, we're slightly above our historical 1.5%, 1.7% and it's due to a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes a number of smaller customers that are modifying or shutting down kind of older technologies. We have a number of sites that were never on air. So, in some cases, they're not being renewed, plus there is actually still some legacy consolidation churn as well related to old vestiges of old mergers, including Verizon-Alltel, AT&T-Centennial, and all kinds of things that you've probably long forgotten about. So, it's a mishmash of different things.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. And on Dish, Dave, I mean our comments haven't changed. Dish has publicly said that they're doing a lot of planning and prep work this year and very little capex and spending. And we've said the same thing and there is no Dish in our guidance. But we have great relationship. We talk to them all the time. We do a lot of planning and we think we're going to, over the years, be a big help to them and a good partner to them. And it will start first with probably services on the site acquisition side of things, but we think it will certainly morph to and turn into leasing business.\nDavid Barden: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. So, you mentioned a couple of questions back about the T-Mobile pace being 90 days to 120 days slower than you expected. So, I just wanted to maybe be clear. You were expecting second quarter activity that got pushed into 3Q or you were expecting 3Q activity that doesn't see full run rate until 4Q?\nJeffrey Stoops: I was expecting when the merger was completed that they would hit the ground running in terms of applications and activity. And that -- and I was mistaken. What they chose to spend their time on was synergies and integration and getting the Dish deal done and all things, in hindsight, made tremendous sense for T-Mobile and had to be done and that's basically what has happened.\nJon Atkin: Great. Great, that's helpful. And then any kind of thoughts on the other two carriers out there in terms of just the cadence getting stronger or weaker, or the same out of AT&T and Verizon?\nJeffrey Stoops: Really business as usual, Jon.\nJon Atkin: And then lastly, just a quick question, both of your U.S.-listed peers have ATMs in place, and I'm wondering if that's something that you would consider given some of the comments you made about international and you've done data centers and so forth.\nJeffrey Stoops: Not something we've thought of really. So, we're looking for opportunities to buy our stock back.\nJon Atkin: Very clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go now to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Hey, Jeff. In terms of like companies hitting the ground running, there is definitely a narrative out there that the C-band is also going on trigger one company to have hit the ground running. When -- should you already be having conversations with carriers? I know C-band is obviously not starting until December, but it's a couple of months away. Are you already having discussions with operators that would give us some indication that people that expect to win at C-band are going to be hitting the ground running in 2021? Because that's certainly the narrative. And I'm just curious when we should expect those dialogues to occur between those carriers and yourself?\nJeffrey Stoops: I would say -- I would answer that question with one word, Walt, indirectly.\nWalter Piecyk: Can you hear me now?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, I can now.\nWalter Piecyk: I didn't get your answer, indirectly, got you. Sorry, my second question was -- I thought there was going to a lengthier answer, I think indirectly was going to be it, I got you. Sorry. Brazil, like if you were going to buy what you own in Brazil today, what do you think a reasonable multiple is for that business? I mean, I know, it's only like 15% of your EBITDA, but with everything that's going on in Brazil right now, currency, what the President is doing there in terms of COVID and everything else, what do you think a good comp is or what you'd be willing to pay for an asset there?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I'm not going to answer that because it will -- I don't know what it will do to the stock. I will answer the question the following. Brazil continues to be a country that has tremendous opportunity. And we're so far ahead of our operational plan there. This is all about FX in Brazil. And everything else is great. And if you look at where the things that you mentioned are and how they have affected FX in Brazil, it's been a one, two, three punch between the President down there and the pandemic. And I guess what people have to, I guess, come to a referendum on is, is this the way it's always going to be in Brazil? Is it always going to just depreciate at these kinds of levels? And if it does, then history will say that we made a mistake. It's that simple. I don't believe that. I don't believe that the economy, the people, the huge demand for wireless services, the fact that they don't have the -- they have to do all the things that made us an investor down there in the first place. And I don't believe the currency is going to continue on a one-way trip to Palookaville. And that is how we think about Brazil.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll take a question from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Jeff, one for you, you mentioned backlog a couple of times. Can you talk about the type of growth you've seen through July and really where you expect to finish from a year-over-year standpoint later on this year, call it December? Then one for Brendan. In the guidance -- changed the guidance for new leasing domestically by $3 million. Is that de-risk for the remainder of the year from any T-Mobile new bookings that you were expecting to get? And what does that imply in the guides, since a year ago T-Mobile was sort of slowing down, I would imagine you didn't have much T-Mobile in guidance in the first place. But what's in the guide for the year, so, for T-Mobile? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, it's not -- it's not necessarily specific to T-Mobile. Obviously, most of our guidance is based on stuff that we've already signed up. So there is a portion of that includes T-Mobile, although they've been slow as we've talked about in the last few quarters. So, its contribution to the incremental growth, organic growth is limited. There is still some amount of T-Mobile contribution to our full-year organic growth number that we are including in our guidance based on activity that's happening now and we expect to happen through the balance of the year. But given the delay, it's usually between signing and commencement of revenue. It's relatively small. So, it's -- I guess if they did absolutely zero and they stop today, then there would be conceivably some minor amount of risk. But given the pace at which they're operating, that's just not likely to be the case. So we feel good about our guidance.\nJeffrey Stoops: What was your first question mentioned, Brandon?\nBrandon Nispel: Well, you mentioned bookings a couple of times and specifically, I think you mentioned sort of picking up after the second quarter ended. So, I was hoping you could give us an update on where you are from a year-over-year standpoint in bookings or even backlog of unsigned lease applications from a year-over-year basis in July and where you expect to be as you finish the year?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, we clearly expect to be higher at year end than we are today. But remember, our growth rate is a trailing 12-month metric. So -- and it was -- it has weakened since Q3 of last year. So, you need to expect to see that. But in terms of backlogs, we expect the end of Q3 to be better than end of Q2 and the end of Q4 to be better than in Q3.\nBrandon Nispel: Would you expect year-over-year third quarter to be better than last year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, actually.\nBrandon Nispel: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Spencer Kern with New Street Research. Your line is open.\nSpencer Kurn: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So, just to follow-up on Brandon's comments about the $3 million that you lowered, that you took out of new leasing activity guidance. Could you help us understand the assumptions that underpinned that level of contribution from T-Mobile? Did that assume sort of a reasonable run rate by the end of the year? Or do you think that -- what you had baked into guidance originally you expected to be a midway point to even higher growth in later quarters? And then as a follow-up, could you just help us understand the cadence of organic growth that you're expecting for the rest of the year? Your guidance of 4.1% for the year implies a slowdown in the back half. And so, should we expect the low point to be in the fourth quarter or do you bottom sometime in the third quarter and start to come back up? Thank you for -- thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. So, I'll answer the second one first. We do expect it to -- we expect actually the third quarter and the fourth quarter will probably be very, very similar to each other, but they will be the low point. And obviously, they will be lower than we reported for the second quarter, which is implied in the full-year number. So you should assume somewhere probably the gross number will be closer to 5.5% or high 5% range in each of the next two quarters domestically. And then on the T-Mobile piece, the way that it was guided to previously assumed that they were active in the second quarter in signing up new leases and amendments. And given that it's in the second quarter, we expected obviously a number of those, particularly the amendments to convert to revenue producers before the end of the year, which obviously would have contributed to that growth number. The fact that there has been some delay there pushes that activity toward the latter half of the year and significantly reduces the amount of the impact of this year's financial statement contributions.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, it's not significant. It's basically what happens when you take 90 days to 120 days' worth of activity and push it back, that's the impact on the fiscal year.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I mean, that basically represents the reduction, the $3 million reduction that we put in our numbers.\nJeffrey Stoops: All of this is pushed back, but it has a fiscal year impact.\nSpencer Kurn: Got it. Thanks. And just one more question, when you talk about you've seen the 5G amendments today, are those coming in as a typical amendments rate that you've seen historically? Or is there some sort of a difference based on the type of equipment you're seeing going up for 5G?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, they're coming in as expected. And remember that we did have experience with this for a while with Sprint.\nSpencer Kurn: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. At this time, there are no further questions in queue.\nJeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, we appreciate everyone dialing in today. And on behalf of all of us here, we wish everyone stay safe, stay healthy and look forward to our next call in three months. Good bye.\nOperator: Thank you. As stated earlier, today's conference call was recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 8 PM Eastern Time today and running through August 17th. You may access the AT&T replay playback by dialing 866-207-1041 or international callers may use 402-970-0847. Either number will need the access code of 1062990.

            "name": "Jeffrey Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another solid one for SBA, both financially and operationally. We again produced leasing revenue, TCF, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO that were well ahead of our expectations. Our TCF and adjusted EBITDA margins were once again a high bar as the highest in our company's history and our AFFO per share grew 14.8% on a constant currency basis over the second quarter of last year. Our business remains healthy and strong. While we greatly appreciate our position in an essential mission-critical business, we recognize that many people are suffering from the continuing impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic. When we first reported our first quarter results three months ago, we did not expect so many of the markets in which we operate to still be deep in the fight against the virus at this time. While I'm happy with our performance, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our team members, customers, suppliers, and other members of the SBA family. At SBA, most of our offices have only been open to essential team members for the last four and a half months and we have figured out how to adjust to being a largely remote workforce. We've had a relatively small percentage of our global team members test positive for the virus and we are thankful that they're all doing okay. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and level of performance by our team members during these very challenging times, serving our customers and our communities. We have learned how to operate safely in this environment and we will continue to do so. In the U.S., the virus has had very little impact on our operational results. Things continue to be good, but as you heard from Brendan earlier, the level of domestic operational activity or new bookings during the quarter was at a similar level to the first quarter, and this is definitely lower than we expected a few months ago, primarily due to a slower start than we had anticipated from T-Mobile after the closing of their merger with Sprint. And we don't really see this as COVID-related, but T-Mobile choosing to initially focus on closing the Boost deal with Dish, integrating workforces, and delivering on synergies. In typical T-Mobile fashion, they seemed to have acted quickly, decisively, and thoughtfully and now have the organization they want in place to turn full attention to their network development needs and obligations. Although our timing was off by a quarter or so on when we initially thought we would see a material increase to domestic leasing activity, the anticipated increases in our application backlogs have now started, providing us confidence and steadily increasing bookings during the second half of 2020. And increased bookings will, of course, drive increased organic revenue growth in the periods following these bookings. We are excited about our prospects because we believe that we have now just begun the necessary phase of increased capital investment in macro networks in order to offer true 5G service. T-Mobile has a lot to do to meet their required 5G coverage goals; including upgrading the majority of their sites with either 2.5 gigahertz or 600 megahertz spectrum and we expect to be a valued partner to them in meeting their build-out objectives. In addition to T-Mobile, our other major domestic customers all have significant projects in process or ahead of them. AT&T recently launched true 5G service on low-band spectrum in a number of markets and we expect both AT&T and Verizon, and many others to be active in the current CBRS auction and particularly, AT&T and Verizon to be active in the C-band auction scheduled for later this year, which we believe will be a key component of future 5G networks and will require new equipment at many of their existing macro sites. In addition, our discussions with Dish have been very constructive and we anticipate that they will be actively engaged in building out a nationwide 5G network over a multi-year period. The fact patterns are setting up very well for a busy domestic leasing and services environment for the next several years. Internationally, we saw solid demand in most of our markets. However, we do believe there will be greater impact in our Latin American and South African markets than in the U.S. from the COVID-19 crisis. Some of our larger international customers have faced challenge economies and even government-required payment deferrals from their customers. As a result, some of our international customers have reduced anticipated capital expenditures and network expansion investment, while they assess the length and severity of the pandemic in each of their markets. We view these current reductions as temporary. Wireless is almost always the primary source of broadband services in these markets. And we believe that as economic conditions improve, wireless capital spending will increase considerably. In our largest international market, Brazil, we're watching closely the recent announcements from our wireless carrier customer, Oi, regarding their plans to divest their mobile wireless assets. A consortium of the other three largest carriers in the market have expressed interest and submitted the most recent bid on these assets, although much needs to occur before any transaction can be consummated. Oi mobile represents 37.6% of our total Brazil cash leasing revenue and 3% of our total overall cash leasing revenue. Oi mobile's largest portfolio-wide carrier overlap is with Telefonica in Brazil with Oi's revenue on those overlap sites representing less than 1% of our total overall cash leasing revenue, although any transaction would likely present much less overlap exposure as the three acquiring carriers would be expected for regulatory reasons to split up Oi's assets based on each carrier's geographic area of greatest need. Our Oi mobile leases also have an average remaining non-cancellable term of eight years. We continue to believe our long-term prospects in Brazil will be bolstered by a shift from four major carriers to just three stronger carriers competing on the basis of network quality. We expect the resolution of Oi's future will be a positive step toward an increased growth cycle in Brazil and improved wireless carrier health. We continue to favor investing in macro towers, including internationally over other types of investments. Over the years, we feel we have proven very adept at managing the risk of international investments versus the benefits of faster growth, higher targeted returns, and more opportunities for investment. At the end of the second quarter, we enjoyed industry leading international tower cash flow margins and our most mature international investments are generating attractive returns well above our cost of capital with much growth still ahead. We are very pleased. In addition to macro towers, we have continued to pursue other opportunities to create value around our sites with a focus on leveraging those assets, strengthening core revenue streams, accessing large new customers, and investing in strategic technology. One of the areas of growth we are pursuing is SBA Edge, where we are focused on using our existing tower assets to offer highly distributed local sites for edge data centers with the potential to provide low latency connectivity to wireless networks. We currently have over 8,000 pre-qualified tower sites in the U.S. as locations where we can situate an edge data center with access to secure space, power and fiber. These tower edge data centers will provide co-location options for customers computing infrastructure with connectivity to a larger metro data center for internet for private network connectivity. In order to support this business, we have deployed an edge data center at our tower site in Foxborough, Massachusetts and we have also made investments in larger more centralized data centers that we believe will act as edge hubs or intermediate aggregation points for compute and storage. Last year, we added a data center, our first in West Chicago, and just recently we acquired our second data center called Jacksonville's Network Access Point, or JaxNAP for short, located in Jacksonville, Florida. JaxNAP is 280,000-square foot 14 megawatt facility providing regional co-location and interconnection services to a variety of customers, including sub-sea cable telecommunications companies and approximately 20 fiber providers, all accessing and sharing the property. JaxNAP will allow us to develop deeper data center capabilities and further enhance our tower edge data center value proposition through increased interconnection and operational knowledge. We're excited about the potential of this value-added business line and are in discussions with a number of interested parties about a range of our expanding capabilities in this area. As we've said many times, however, for this new product offering to ever be material for SBA, a real 5G ecosystem needs to develop. Based on the increasing number of conversations we're having, we are optimistic that this will happen in the years to come. Moving now to our balance sheet, we were able to seize on favorable capital market conditions over the last couple of months to reduce our weighted average cost of debt and extend our maturities. We currently have no debt maturities until 2022 and we have higher liquidity than at any time in our history, including our fully available undrawn $1.25 billion revolver. In July, we issued $1.35 billion of securities in the securitization market, including $750 million of 5.5-year paper at fixed rate of 1.88%, the lowest fixed price debt in our history. Our June 30th leverage was 6.9 times, a level I'm very comfortable with and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend. We did not repurchase any shares of stock in the second quarter; because we were targeting some of the volatility we took advantage of in the first quarter. We didn't get it, but stock repurchases remain a critical part of our value creation strategy. We announced today our dividend for the third quarter at a level of 26% above our third quarter dividend last year. Our dividend, however, remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us the opportunity to continue investing in exclusive multi-tenant assets producing returns well above our cost of capital. SBA's adept use of leverage throughout our history has truly differentiated us from our peers to the clear benefit of you, our equity holders. It was another solid quarter in a very challenging time. I want to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We expect to stay very busy, serving our customers and our communities and we look forward to a solid and even better second half of the year. And with that, Nick, we are ready for questions. We will continue the same schedule. It's interesting. We've had -- there are two schools of thought among our shareholders. There is the spread it out evenly approach and there is the maximize the NPV approach or the maximize-out-the-returns over time. And I don't want to get too far into how things will go. That will be a one or two or perhaps something of that in the middle. In terms of T-Mobile, I mean they're smart guys. They're looking for the best results that will be a mix of financial certainty, financial results, speed and all the things that they need to do to really play for the big picture, which is the race to be ubiquitous 5G. We are here and ready to go for Dish. We've worked with them for years now. They're a very good customer and when they say they're ready to go, we are ready to go for them. Thanks Rick. Well, I don't think that commentary is inconsistent at all with what we're seeing now in terms of increasing applications and backlogs. So I would say that that's consistent. In terms of international, I think given the types of populations that are being served in South America and South Africa. I think, Batya, you're going to -- it's going to be largely dependent on where the virus is and what stages of lockdown and economic activity you're going to see in those markets. Yes. We do, but we're not going to get into that specifically, Simon. That's -- we don't do that. Yes. Yes, I mean, what people should take from our commentary is everything is pretty much exactly like we thought. It's just 90 days to 120 days behind where we thought it would be. And then in terms of your first question was, yes, we do expect opportunities to come out of that. I mean, fixed wireless, it's got -- in certain areas; it's going to be better for macro sites than others. I mean, some of the applications are more existing poles and not necessarily towers as much as some of the cash stuff was. But we do see opportunities there. We think that there is going to be some added benefit from there. And all of these programs, which this unfortunate COVID-19 thing, so much highlights the need for increased spending and broadband rural connectivity. We will see some incremental benefits from that in the years to come. Well, that's -- your last question, Mike, is really the business model choice that needs to be made, which is one of -- there is basically three options for us, which is to be just the basic landlord and run out the pad and the -- basically the improvements and the connections. The second will be to take the middle ground and own the shell and the infrastructure, but let somebody else own the active electronics and operate them; and then the third is run the whole thing. And that's really what the data center ownership and operation is designed to allow us to when it really comes time to make that decision to be in a position to do. The other thing that we have learned is that for the folks who will be at -- and this we've learned since over the last year and it was one of the impetuses behind this recent -- our second data center purchase, is that for all the folks who are going to be customers at the edge, at the cell site, they all need and will be coming from some other larger data center repository. So, the -- it's really quite interesting how the connectivity needs to work where large storage goes to moderate size and then ultimately out to the edge, so the ultimate edge. So, the data center connections to the ultimate edge are going to be very important, and that's part of what we're working on here as well. And we want to make sure we understand and have that capability operationally down. And whether in 10 years we own these data centers, more or less, I can't tell you, but we will understand what the relationships are between the absolute edge, which is what ultimately will be our forte and the data center aggregation points along the way that will be necessary to make it all work. Brendan, I'm going to let you handle the Oi stuff. Colby, we'd rather not let leverage continue to come down, especially given the cost at which we're accessing debt and the growth that we have. We'd rather be out investing in our -- in new assets first and portfolio growth second. But we're not going to do stupid expenditures. I mean, that's always been the motto and the course of action here. So, there is a lot of things out there that we continue to look at and will be looking at, certainly enough to meet our minimum 5% portfolio growth. We certainly have the liquidity more than plenty there to accomplish that. And it is our goal and belief that we will get there, but it's got to be the right stuff. Yes, we're going to hard. We're going to work hard to do that. That's certainly our first choice. I don't have it in the bag today. Yes, let me just be clear. That eight years was the mobile. We didn't even -- I mean, we didn't even work into that calculation, the wireline. Yes, I mean, we were slightly better. I mean, you're looking at $1 million or so in the quarter of probably reduced SG&A due to things like that, but it's not overly material. The towers, well, I mean, I'd like to say that was a lot but it really wasn't. Most of that was in the US and they were healthy multiples, because they were very high quality assets. I mean, there still continues to be a strong bid, which goes back to the exchange I had with Colby about that's where we want to be. But that's -- you have to be very careful because prices continue to be challenging and not every tower is created equal. And your -- I'm sorry, your second question, Tim? Indoor. Yes, we continue to move along in that area and add a couple properties every quarter, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a steady growing business. And it's a much more difficult business in many respects, because it is absolutely a custom one asset at a time business. But we are very encouraged by what's going on in the CBRS auction, I think it topped $1 billion today and that means there is, from what I understand, wide interest. And I think that's going to be very good for that business. Yes. And on Dish, Dave, I mean our comments haven't changed. Dish has publicly said that they're doing a lot of planning and prep work this year and very little capex and spending. And we've said the same thing and there is no Dish in our guidance. But we have great relationship. We talk to them all the time. We do a lot of planning and we think we're going to, over the years, be a big help to them and a good partner to them. And it will start first with probably services on the site acquisition side of things, but we think it will certainly morph to and turn into leasing business. I was expecting when the merger was completed that they would hit the ground running in terms of applications and activity. And that -- and I was mistaken. What they chose to spend their time on was synergies and integration and getting the Dish deal done and all things, in hindsight, made tremendous sense for T-Mobile and had to be done and that's basically what has happened. Really business as usual, Jon. Not something we've thought of really. So, we're looking for opportunities to buy our stock back. I would say -- I would answer that question with one word, Walt, indirectly. Yes, I can now. Well, I'm not going to answer that because it will -- I don't know what it will do to the stock. I will answer the question the following. Brazil continues to be a country that has tremendous opportunity. And we're so far ahead of our operational plan there. This is all about FX in Brazil. And everything else is great. And if you look at where the things that you mentioned are and how they have affected FX in Brazil, it's been a one, two, three punch between the President down there and the pandemic. And I guess what people have to, I guess, come to a referendum on is, is this the way it's always going to be in Brazil? Is it always going to just depreciate at these kinds of levels? And if it does, then history will say that we made a mistake. It's that simple. I don't believe that. I don't believe that the economy, the people, the huge demand for wireless services, the fact that they don't have the -- they have to do all the things that made us an investor down there in the first place. And I don't believe the currency is going to continue on a one-way trip to Palookaville. And that is how we think about Brazil. What was your first question mentioned, Brandon? Well, we clearly expect to be higher at year end than we are today. But remember, our growth rate is a trailing 12-month metric. So -- and it was -- it has weakened since Q3 of last year. So, you need to expect to see that. But in terms of backlogs, we expect the end of Q3 to be better than end of Q2 and the end of Q4 to be better than in Q3. Yes. Yes, actually. Well, it's not significant. It's basically what happens when you take 90 days to 120 days' worth of activity and push it back, that's the impact on the fiscal year. All of this is pushed back, but it has a fiscal year impact. Well, they're coming in as expected. And remember that we did have experience with this for a while with Sprint. Great. Well, we appreciate everyone dialing in today. And on behalf of all of us here, we wish everyone stay safe, stay healthy and look forward to our next call in three months. Good bye."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA produced another solid performance during the second quarter notwithstanding continued hardship and uncertainty for many across all of our markets due to COVID-19. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $482.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $482.1 million. Foreign exchange rate were a $1.3 million tailwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the second quarter. They were, however, a significant headwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $21.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5% over the second quarter of 2019, including the impact of 1.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.9%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 6.7% on a gross basis and 4.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of churn, 0.5% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter, was again slower than a year ago period and remain similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2019. The measured pace of new bookings in the quarter was primarily due to a slower restart than we anticipated by T-Mobile following the closing of their merger with Sprint, while our other domestic customers were steady. However, as we have begun the third quarter, we have seen a meaningful increase in application activity from T-Mobile that we expect to drive increased domestic organic bookings in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. During the second quarter, amendment activity was again the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 69% from amendments and 31% from new leases. The big three carriers represented 70% of total incremental provisional domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We again have a nice contribution to domestic leasing activity from some cap to funded rural broadband providers. As I mentioned a moment ago, our domestic application backlog has started to grow nicely, which portends well for a steadily increasing pace of new bookings during the second half of the year. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.8%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.3% on a gross basis. We continue to see leasing activity internationally, but was a little slower overall in prior periods due to COVID-related spending reductions by customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.4% on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, 86.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.9% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $394.1 million. Our industry leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.3% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 71.5%, also industry leading and was 91.1% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $368.8 million. Our industry leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.8% in the quarter, up 300 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 77.1%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. Our second quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were again both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the second quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.29, an increase of 9.6% over the second quarter of 2019 and a 14.8% increase on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 16 communication sites for $13.4 million and building a total of 79 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased 25 communication sites and one data center for an aggregate price of $61.6 million and we have agreed to purchase 100 additional sites for an aggregate price of $42 million. We anticipate closing on a majority of these sites by the end of the year. The data center is located in Jacksonville, Florida and will allow us to continue to expand our knowledge of the data center business and will, we believe, be ultimately critical to maximizing our edge data center offerings as we continue to develop our strategy and invest in the provision of edge data centers located at our existing communication sites. Jeff will discuss in further detail in a moment. We also continue to invest in the lands under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $12.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years. In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020 providing increases in all key metrics. Outperformance against our second quarter foreign currency exchange assumptions and slight improvements in forecasted FX rates for the balance of the year have partially contributed to our increased outlook. Increases due to acquisitions and better than anticipated cash basis revenue collections offset by modestly lower expected contributions from new leasing activity represented the rest of the increase in our full-year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a slower start to new revenue bookings this year than we had previously expected, which ultimately slightly delayed by 90 days to 120 days, the timing of new revenue growth from organic lease-up. However, given our increasing application backlog, our recent customer conversations and the significant network deployment obligations of some of our customers, we expect this timing delay to be just that, a timing delay. We anticipate growth in domestic bookings in each of the next two quarters and into 2021. I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Yes, Rick. That's a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes things like some higher cash basis holdover fees that we received some -- a little bit higher on the structural augmentation, amortization and even some back-filling or out-of-period stuff. So, a lot of that was outperformance in the second quarter and a little bit of that is expected outperformance for the balance of the year. Rick? Yes, now we can. Yes. And Colby, on -- Colby, on your question with regard to Oi, first of all, in terms of bad debt reserves, we didn't book any material bad debt reserves in the second quarter. And then from a getting paid standpoint, they continue to pay us the full amount that they owe us. So, no issues there. Hey, Nick. It's Brendan. So, from a ROIC standpoint, we're not breaking out that information specifically, given the different maturity levels of those portfolios. But I can tell you some general directional information about it, which is -- some of it may be obvious, which is that the domestic ROIC is obviously higher than the consolidated 10.2% number that we put out, while the international was lower. But some of our more mature international markets like in Central America have current ROICs that are in the high-single digits. And in the case of certain countries like Panama actually exceed the U.S. So, the more mature markets that we've been in have been -- performed very, very well. The less mature South American markets typically have ROICs that are in the mid-single digits. We've had obviously some FX headwinds that have weighed on the Brazil numbers a little bit. But on a constant currency basis, that's up north of 9%. So, we expect, as we kind of get into a little bit more normalized time period in terms of currency, that, that number will actually show very well. So it's all gone pretty well in our markets that we've been in for a while. Yes. For Oi? Yes. So some of -- almost all of the Oi leases are leases that we acquired through leaseback scenarios. They average varying terms, but they're all quite long. So when you look at Oi mobile as a whole, the average remaining term is a little over eight years on those leases. And then we have some Oi fixed wireline leases as well that are actually north of 25 years. So, between the two, it's an extensive long time left. David, on the churn, just as a point of clarification, obviously those percentages are same-tower percentages, so they're representative of a trailing 12-month period. I think you saw a little bit of a step-up in that a couple of quarters ago. And it's really the same thing that's kind of in there that's affecting. So, we're slightly above our historical 1.5%, 1.7% and it's due to a variety of miscellaneous things. It includes a number of smaller customers that are modifying or shutting down kind of older technologies. We have a number of sites that were never on air. So, in some cases, they're not being renewed, plus there is actually still some legacy consolidation churn as well related to old vestiges of old mergers, including Verizon-Alltel, AT&T-Centennial, and all kinds of things that you've probably long forgotten about. So, it's a mishmash of different things. Yes, Brandon, it's not -- it's not necessarily specific to T-Mobile. Obviously, most of our guidance is based on stuff that we've already signed up. So there is a portion of that includes T-Mobile, although they've been slow as we've talked about in the last few quarters. So, its contribution to the incremental growth, organic growth is limited. There is still some amount of T-Mobile contribution to our full-year organic growth number that we are including in our guidance based on activity that's happening now and we expect to happen through the balance of the year. But given the delay, it's usually between signing and commencement of revenue. It's relatively small. So, it's -- I guess if they did absolutely zero and they stop today, then there would be conceivably some minor amount of risk. But given the pace at which they're operating, that's just not likely to be the case. So we feel good about our guidance. Yes. Sure. So, I'll answer the second one first. We do expect it to -- we expect actually the third quarter and the fourth quarter will probably be very, very similar to each other, but they will be the low point. And obviously, they will be lower than we reported for the second quarter, which is implied in the full-year number. So you should assume somewhere probably the gross number will be closer to 5.5% or high 5% range in each of the next two quarters domestically. And then on the T-Mobile piece, the way that it was guided to previously assumed that they were active in the second quarter in signing up new leases and amendments. And given that it's in the second quarter, we expected obviously a number of those, particularly the amendments to convert to revenue producers before the end of the year, which obviously would have contributed to that growth number. The fact that there has been some delay there pushes that activity toward the latter half of the year and significantly reduces the amount of the impact of this year's financial statement contributions. Yes, I mean, that basically represents the reduction, the $3 million reduction that we put in our numbers."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.  Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 5, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.  In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. Well, SBA had another solid quarter operationally and financially. And given the unprecedented events occurring around the globe, we feel both pleased and fortunate to be able to report our results.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $492.3 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $490 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $2.7 million headwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the first quarter. They were also a headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2019.  Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.6% over the first quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 7.6% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 2.1% of churn, 0.7% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was slower than the year ago period and similar to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH, awaiting resolution of the legal challenges to the Sprint/T-Mobile merger and the ultimate closing of the merger.  Amendment activity was again, the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 84% from amendments and 16% from new leases. Despite the lack of contribution from T-Mobile and Sprint, the big 4 carriers, now big 3 carriers still represented 79% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We did have some nice contributions to domestic leasing activity from a couple of regional carriers.  Our domestic application backlog remains strong, and we expect that with the closing of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger now behind us, we will soon begin to see a significant increase in incremental leasing activity. Early activity post-merger has finally begun.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.1%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.6% on a gross basis. Leasing activity internationally was largely in line with expectations for the quarter. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up, and we continue to see contributions from all 4 major carriers there.  Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.8% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 84.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.6% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $398.1 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.2% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 70.4% and was 90.5%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $369.9 million. Our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.9% in the quarter up 150 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.7%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. Our first quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the first quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.28, an increase of 10.1% over the first quarter of 2019 and a 13.5% increase on a constant currency basis.  During the first quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 69 communication sites for $79.9 million and building a total of 49 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase 137 additional sites at an aggregate price of $52 million, which sites we anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $6.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years.  In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020. The most material changes to our outlook are the result of significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we initially provided our 2020 outlook. The weakening of the Brazilian real, South African rand and Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, have caused us to revise our estimates for these currency exchange rates for the balance of 2020.  The combination of these estimate changes and the actual first quarter exchange rates relative to our prior assumptions, have negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by $47 million. Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were negatively impacted by $32 million, $30 million and $29 million, respectively, due to these updated exchange rate assumptions. AFFO per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.26. Excluding the impact of these foreign currency-related adjustments, we raised our full year outlook for leasing revenue, tower cash flow and AFFO per share. Even with the T-Mobile-Sprint merger-related overall industry slowdown in the U.S. in the second half of last year and year-to-date this year, we still anticipate another year of solid growth in our leasing business. Although primarily concentrated in the second half of this year. We raised our full year domestic leasing revenue expectations, although we have made a minor reduction to the anticipated contribution from new leasing activity, both domestically and internationally, due primarily to a conservative view around the possible impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  While these are immaterial changes, and we haven't seen any material delays to date, it is impossible today to say with certainty that there will not be some minor impact from COVID-19 somewhere in our business this year.  Similarly, with regard to our services business, we have lowered our full year revenue outlook largely due to potential impacts from COVID-19 and slower activity levels in the first half of the year, pending the expected lift from T-Mobile post-merger. Our full year outlook still contemplates a pickup in our leasing and services businesses in the second half of the year, particularly now that the Sprint/ T-Mobile merger has closed. Our customers have a ton to do, and it is apparent to us in our backlogs, and in our discussions with them. As a result, we remain excited about not only 2020, but the next several years of activity.  I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the first quarter with $10.7 billion of total debt and $10.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x, down 1/10th of a turn since last quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio, of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.9x, which was up 1/10th of a turn since last quarter.  On February 4, we issued $1 billion of new 7-year unsecured senior notes at an interest rate of 3.875%. The proceeds of which were used to redeem all of our outstanding 2002, 4.875% senior notes, pay the associated call premium on those notes and repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of today, the outstanding balance under our revolver is $380 million. The weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.6% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years.  During the first quarter, we repurchased 824,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million or an average price of $242.86 per share. All shares repurchased were retired. As of today, we have $424.3 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020, are $111.6 million compared to $113.2 million at March 31, 2019, a reduction of 1.5%.  In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $52.2 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared an equivalent second quarter dividend of $0.465 per share, payable on June 18, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 28, 2020.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The first quarter was a solid start to the year financially and operationally for SBA. We produced leasing revenue, TCF and AFFO per share that were all well ahead of our expectations. Our domestic and international TCF margins as well as our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were the highest in our company's history, and our AFFO per share growth on a constant currency basis of 13.5% over the first quarter of last year is evidence of the tremendous growth characteristics of our business, a very resilient predictable business. The solid growth gives us great confidence in continuing to invest in our business while paying out one of the fastest-growing dividends anywhere. We announced today our second quarterly dividend of the year at an annual -- excuse me, at an amount of 26% over our quarterly dividend paid in the second half of last year.  During the quarter, we were active both adding assets to our portfolio and repurchasing our stock. We invested over $100 million in new assets and repurchased $200 million of our stock. We were once again opportunistic in our share repurchase efforts, buying stock at an average price of $242.86.  While all of that certainly sounds great, our thoughts these days are largely consumed by COVID-19. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatic. We've all been affected in some way, including SBA. Our hearts go out to those that have lost loved ones or had health complications due to this virus. And we have also concern for those who have lost jobs or faced economic hardships due to the far-reaching shutdowns undertaken in response to the virus. Thankfully, we have only had a handful of team members test positive, which we're very fortunate for with the global workforce of almost 1,500 team members. And thankfully, they're all doing okay.  Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, SBA was not a telecommuting company. We learned to become a telecommuting company in 14 countries in less than a week. For those of our team members in essential jobs where they could not work from home, including all of our services team members working for our customers every day, we developed state of the art health and safety protocols with the constant assistance of medical professionals. I don't feel we've missed a beat, and I salute all of our team members for their dedication, service and commitment.  At SBA, we recognize both that we are fortunate to be in an industry that has proven resilient to the challenges of the current environment and that we have an obligation to support the communities in which we live and work. One thing that has become abundant and clear during this crisis is the tremendous importance of broadband and wireless connectivity, a cornerstone to the continued functioning of much of our society during this time of social distancing.  In recognition of this, we have supported our customers and their efforts to address the needs of our communities. Our tower crews have been on the front lines, installing equipment, checking equipment, performing maintenance and repairs, checking and resetting power systems and performing other site level tasks, not normally within SBA scope. We've ensured uninterrupted access to sites for authorized personnel 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  In many of our international markets, we've made cell on wheel solutions available to our customers at no charge. We've also accelerated payments to certain of our vendors facing hardships. We are busy. All of our team members remain fully employed, and we have recently added some employees in anticipation of a more active second half.  Finally, SBA has committed material financial resources to support charitable organizations in each of the domestic and international markets where we have offices. We believe it is important to support the communities where our team members live, work and raise their families. And we feel fortunate that we are able to do it. From a financial standpoint, our business continues to be strong during these challenging times. The impacts to our core business from COVID-19 have been minor, a few delays here and there. The only material negative impact we currently expect to our financial projections, as you heard from Brendan, is due to weaker foreign exchange rates in our largest international markets. We are hopeful that these rates will improve when the current crisis has eased. But for now, we continue to keep local cash flows in local markets supporting local operations, so there will be no impact to our day-to-day operations in those countries.  The bottom line is the future is very bright for SBA. In fact, as you heard from Brendan, but for foreign exchange adjustments, we would have been increasing our full year outlook in a number of important areas, including AFFO per share. We are financially healthy, well positioned in critical business and there are a number of growth drivers ahead of us.  One of those growth drivers is, of course, the new T-Mobile. With the closing of the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction now behind us, we are on the cusp of significant network investment by all of our U.S. customers. In order to meet their required 5G coverage goals, the new T-Mobile will require meaningful upgrades across their combined portfolio, deploying both 2.5 gigahertz spectrum and 600 megahertz spectrum. Post-merger discussions and early activity are underway.  Verizon and AT&T are each active in upgrades and network expansion for both 4G and 5G as well. In addition, AT&T's FirstNet build out continues in full swing and deployments of AWS 3 and WCS spectrum continue. We anticipate that both the CBRS and C-band spectrum auction scheduled for later this year will be highly competitive, and ultimately, a material driver of incremental growth for the tower industry, particularly the C-band auction. This critical mid-band spectrum is expected to be a key component of future 5G network deployments, and it will require the deployment of new equipment at many of our customers' existing macro sites.  On top of all this, DISH will be active investing heavily to meet their own 5G coverage commitments as they begin the build-out of a brand-new nationwide facilities-based wireless network. These major initiatives will all support continued growth for SBA for at least the next several years.  Internationally, we expect our business to remain steady. While some of our customers outside the U.S. may feel the impact of COVID-19 more than those in the U.S., at least in the short term, due to government-imposed consumer payment deferrals, the reason those deferrals were implemented in the first place is that wireless is and will remain the primary means of communications in these markets. Expanded wireless services capability and reliability required by the market and perhaps regulatory authority, are expected in these markets. Our current levels of activity and backlogs are very good, and absent some material change from this point forward, we anticipate a solid 2020 internationally.  From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very strong as well. We have plenty of liquidity and good access to incremental capital if needed. We remain a preferred issuer in each of the markets where we access capital, and that is even more the case in the current environment. I'm very comfortable with our current leverage level, and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend.  Our dividend remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us with great capital allocation opportunities. Our asset focus remains unchanged, whether macro towers, mobile edge, in building or other assets, we seek out exclusive multi-tenant mission-critical assets that will be essential for the needs of our customers today and tomorrow and will provide returns to SBA materially above our cost of capital. We are very focused on and pleased with our return on invested capital. Strength of our financial position shines through in times like these.  Finally, I'd like to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We are all in this together. As I mentioned earlier, I could not be more proud of the way that the SBA team has come together in these challenging times, and performed at a very high level. With their continued contributions, I look forward to a solid and improving rest of the year. We have adjusted well and will continue to adjust well to the times, and we remain laser-focused on serving our customers and providing increasing returns to our shareholders.  Rich, with that, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will start with the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: So it's good to hear that the team is functioning so well in these tough times. I think, Jeff, you guys have had special relationship with DISH in terms of their network build initiatives thus far. They recently announced the first RFP vendor, Mavenir, an OpenRAN company that's going to be kind of the glue that will be kind of pulling their network together.  I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit as you think about your guidance for the year. How dependent it is and how confident you are in DISH's plans for deploying some kind of physical services based network and kind of your conviction that they're for real when it comes to the business? I mean it's super helpful to get your views on that.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, thanks, David. I hope you are well, you and your family. We know DISH is for real. They are extremely committed to this undertaking. There's a tremendous amount at stake and at-risk for Mr. Ergen and his shareholders, if they are not successful and they are certainly pursuing it in every way, shape and form to our visibility to be successful. We're very, very, very involved with them in all kinds of conversations. Recall from their prior disclosures that they expect this year to be a very, very big planning year with deployments really to commence next year.  So based on those comments, we have not included virtually anything in our leasing guidance and perhaps very little in our services guidance, but that does not mean that work relationships are not quite good and quite voluminous between the companies. And I wouldn't bet against him.\nDavid Barden: Jeff, if I could have a quick follow-up, would just be -- you've called out Sprint/ T-Mobile being a big part of the landscape in the coming 6 months, which I think we all expect. I guess some of us were surprised to see that they really jumped out of the gates with the Philadelphia 2.5 gigahertz launch announcing the New York market is going to be next. Is there something about the Sprint/T-Mobile merger deployment schedule that seems faster than expected? Or is it kind of what you were anticipating?\nJeffrey Stoops: We really didn't know. But now we have a lot greater visibility. And I think what we're seeing is that based on where both companies were, particularly with Sprint with their already somewhat deployed 2.5 G that will be the markets that T-Mobile will quickly gravitate to launch first because it's logical, and it just makes sense. So I don't know that there's any surprises there as much, David, as there is now starting to be some clarity.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRichard Prentiss: Glad to hear you, your families and employees are doing well, hope that continues. First, also a shout out for a very well-timed opportunistic stock buyback, again, always good to see. You mentioned that the services business would be down $20 million view to view on your guidance because of impact from COVID-19 and maybe a slower first half activity with the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. Is that -- and again, it might not happen, you haven't seen anything so far, I think you said but is that really thinking about what zoning permitting and the ability to get folks onto the site might be?\nJeffrey Stoops: I think what we're experiencing so far, and again, none of it is COVID -- well, it is COVID-related, but none of it's material. Everything just seems to take a little bit longer. And when we talk about basically doubling the size of the industry's work with the T-Mobile stuff getting really cranked up, just hard for us to just think that there's not going to be some COVID-19 slowdowns. I can't name them all today, but it's just -- there has to be, right? So -- and the rest of the services thing was -- I mean if you look at our first quarter numbers, and it's going to be the same in the first -- in the second quarter, it's was somewhat behind where we thought it was going to be.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And as you think about the guidance for the year, the increasing operational activity. Do you need an MLA in place to capture some of that services and leasing growth? And how long would new MLAs take, given how complicated some of this work might be?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, we have MLAs in place with both T-Mobile and Sprint, which continue to be in place. Now I don't know that they're entirely perfect or totally all covering the things that now need to be covered, but they do cover quite a bit. So the answer is no. We don't need any of that to do the things that we've reflected in our outlook.\nRichard Prentiss: And how long would it take to update MLAs? Is that a matter of months, quarters?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, it could be done a lot quicker than that. Yes, I would certainly think it would be months and not quarters.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.\nSpencer Kurn: I'm glad the organization is all seems to be pretty well and healthy. Just a question on organic growth. Your full year guidance is below where you are -- where you reported in the U.S. today. But it sounds like you're expecting a pretty big uplift later in the year. So could you just help us understand the cadence as we move throughout the year? Do you expect the second quarter to be the trough and gradually improving from there? And I don't know if you want to give us some more granularity, but if you could help us understand the exit rate that you're expecting moving into 2021, that would be very helpful.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, I'm going to give some high-level comments, and I'm going to let Brendan give you some more detail. I mean, recall, Spencer, the way we report that metric, it's a trailing 12 and when Sprint/T-Mobile DISH pulled back, it was like August, September. So you had -- from September on, you had very reduced activity. You had it again in -- you had nothing basically from those guys in Q1. And you won't have really anything from them in Q2. So there's 3 quarters right there that do the kind of -- run the mental mathematical gyrations, and you'll see where things should trough out and then where they should begin to pick up again. So Brendan, do you want to hazard a guess as to exit rates? I'm not sure we want to do that.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you've already suggested spencer that you've calculated based on the revenue bridge and our supplemental package, what the full year number is. And if you're looking at it domestically, that number is lower than what we reported for the first quarter. And that's because you will see a lot of the impact that Jeff was just talking about that's happening in the first quarter and into the second quarter, it will continue to drive a trailing 12 months number down, even though we expect activity levels from a leasing standpoint to pick up in the second half of the year, the financial impact of that will not be felt until we get to next year. So I think you should assume that the exit rate is somewhere around what we have projected there for the full year, maybe slightly below that, actually, but accelerating from that point forward would be our expectation.\nSpencer Kurn: And then just on that same topic, you still got about 70 basis points of churn from MetroPCS, LEAP and Clearwire. When should we expect that to roll off? Does that happen later in the year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. You should expect that it will continue to decline, because that's, again, a trailing 12-month number as well. So it will continue to step down because there's not that much left. We've probably got about $4 million or so of annualized revenue from them that we expect to churn off over the next few quarters, I'd say. So it's stepping down already. So that percentage will be lower by the end of the year.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Simon Flannery.\nSimon Flannery: Good to hear everybody is doing okay. You mentioned the CBRS and C-band auctions. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for macro towers with CBRS? Are you talking to some carriers that may deploy that in a macro environment? Or is it -- do you think it's mostly small cells? And then you also commented on some decent activity by regional carriers. Is that something that you're seeing being sustained? Or is that more of a kind of a short-term boost there?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, when we didn't really have anything from T-Mobile and Sprint, it mathematically made up a better percentage of the quarterly pie, Simon, than it typically would. Now I do think there will be some continued activity from those carriers, but I do think it will also decline just because of the law of larger numbers as you see more of the T-Mobile activity come in through the year.  CBRS, I think, is primarily going to be mostly at in-building phenomena, but we are having some conversations with not only traditional wireless providers, but also cable companies about macro installations. But as between the 2 auctions, CBRS versus C-band, I think it's without question going to be a more exciting and more activity producing auction for us with respect to the C band.\nOperator: We'll now go the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: I wanted to ask how much visibility you really have into that services revenue, around the implication is that you're confident that Sprint/T-Mobile is going to be asking you to do a lot of work for them. Can you dig more into what that work will entail? And is that typical of your relationship with Sprint or T-Mobile in the past?\nJeffrey Stoops: It's typical of both, and it does imply that we do the work on our own towers when it comes to amendments or co-locations.\nPhilip Cusick: Is that sort of a standard thing that would happen? Or is this a contract that's already been signed already?\nJeffrey Stoops: It's kind of historical relationships and some contracted relationships as well.\nPhilip Cusick: Understood. And would you frame your thinking on the price of amendments that T-Mobile may be needing versus the average level as they do the work?\nJeffrey Stoops: No. That would not be a good thing for me to do, Phil.\nOperator: We'll now go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk: I guess you called new leasing activity, the 7.6% growth number, Jeff, that actually, based on how we -- I guess we do our math, seems like it didn't drop that much relative to kind of the lack of activity we've been talking about for the last 6 to 9 months. Are you still expecting only, I think, what was the last guidance, $49 million of new lease activity in 2020? Because it seems like -- I mean I think there's some differences in how we do our math versus you, but it seems like your rate would be higher than that for the year. Even if it drops a little bit in the June quarter, if it builds in the September, December quarter based on TMO activity, that you can do better than that, the 49 that I think you talked about in February.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, we actually reduced that number slightly to 47, Walt, in the...\nWalter Piecyk: Sorry, I didn't see Joe's notation here. You're right. He has one [indiscernible] of -- yes, so even more so than, like how is it going to be 47 when you started the year at a 7.6% growth rate based on that 3.37% number last year, that's like a 14, 15 a quarter.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. But we -- if you look at that, obviously, it implies that, that number goes down. And again, that's trailing 12 months. So if you calculate it out for the balance of the year, we're expecting that 7.6% to be lower in future quarters. And it is lower than it was -- that is a step down. In the fourth quarter, that gross number was 8.2%, and I think the quarter before that was 8.6%. So it's stepping down basically based on what we've seen since mid third quarter last year, which was kind of a stop by T-Mobile, in particular.\nWalter Piecyk: So aside from law of large numbers and everything else, though, let's say, it steps down next quarter, whatever, $10 million. But by the September and December quarter, you should be executing on the activity that T-Mobile is delivering to you today, right? So again, I think it's -- it feels like it's hard to get to only 47 for the year.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, recall that's a financial -- recall that's a financial number, not an operational number. So operationally, we expect to be extremely busy but those are -- go ahead, Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, where Jeff is going, they don't commence until later. You said in the third and fourth quarter. But we're just now starting to have activity pick back up with them. We've not been signing anything with T-Mobile basically year-to-date, including going back a quarter and a half of last year. So all the things that start to happen now, even if we become very busy from this point forward and you layer on a commencement date to that, that's typically several months after it's signed up. It's very limiting in its impact for this year. But we do it--.\nWalter Piecyk: That's very helpful because it's interesting because T-Mobile talks about trying to get that 2.5 on their towers in time for the 5G launch of the iPhone. So if they're just kind of giving the stuff to you now and the activity is not going to hit until 2021, there seems to be maybe a bit of a disconnect there. In terms of what they're communicating, right?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I mean, listen, it could be. They could be more aggressive and faster than what it's historically been, but we're not projecting that because we don't have that -- any evidence of that at this point in terms of a timing.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Well, it is starting. It could go quick. Sprint did have -- I won't say a fair amount, but they do have some 2.5G out there already. I don't know if it's enough. It's certainly not enough to cover a nationwide iPhone launch. But I mean it -- I think the main thing to keep in mind, Walt, is the numbers that you read are financial -- they come off the financials. But when we talk about pickups and activity, that's the stuff, that's the signing and the dirt being turned and things like that. And the financial results trail all that stuff.\nWalter Piecyk: So if you book $1 million of new lease activity in Q1 of 2021, what does that mean in terms of when that site has been turned on for a user for the operator?\nBrendan Cavanagh: We sign a $1 million...\nWalter Piecyk: No, no, no what I'm saying is revenue hit your new lease activity. That means that you ramped on that probably means they turn it on right. Do they turn on that quarter? Or do they turned it on the prior quarter?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It usually commences paying once they've installed and turned it on usually when they usually sync up. It doesn't always work that way. It could be that they are paying earlier because there's a drop-dead date. But typically, those 2 things align.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.\nNick Del Deo: First, I think you target 5% to 10% annual portfolio growth. How do you feel about achieving that target given the number of towers you've acquired to date, have under contract and what you see in the market?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, we got a lot to do. We exceeded -- got close to 10% at the end of last year. So we've kind of started off with some lower levels of activity. And you could see where those numbers are now. There's plenty of stuff out there, Nick, and that continues to be our goal. I don't think we will repeat last year's percentage levels, which I believe were close to 10%. But we're still shooting for at least the 5%, and there's enough out there to be done. But like we always do, we want the right assets.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. And then land purchases were down quite a bit versus the normal pace. Is that just a function of legal work getting gummed up because of lockdown?\nJeffrey Stoops: That is one, probably more visible aspect of COVID-19 than perhaps -- that new builds, I mean, a lot of the land purchase things require notorization. Well, you can't leave your house, you can't get things notarized. So that's a very tangible area of the business that has seen some delays. And just to add in. Internationally, most of those deals require an in-person negotiation with the landowners, and that obviously is being limited as well. So it definitely is having an impact.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Now we also think that there will be some more willing sellers.\nNick Del Deo: That was actually my follow-up question, yes.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes. Yes. So we think there will be some balance there over the course of the year.\nOperator: We'll now go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Just two questions, if I could. The first, is spectrum borrowing continues and turns into commercial rentals can you unpack if SBA has monetization opportunities associated with that? And then secondly, any new thoughts on how to try to manage the foreign currency volatility that you've been ingesting in the financials?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Our leases are spectrum specific, Mike. But given why that spectrum is going to be provided in times of a national emergency and to be used to help us all get through this. Provided that's what it's being used for, and it goes back at some point. I don't know that we're going to charge for that. Now if it requires additional equipment to be utilized in new radios and new antennas. But if it's just to help people get through, and there's no new equipment required, even though we could charge for it, we're probably not going to charge for that.  In terms of foreign currency, we have spent many sleepless nights looking for P&L hedges, but they are -- they are cost prohibitive. The only real hedges that work are when you are purchasing an asset in advance, you can hedge your dollars going in. And then the other hedges to borrow in local currency. But in terms of what I think you're talking about looking for to purchase a P&L hedge, there is not one out there that is -- makes cost sense.\nBrendan Cavanagh: We do try to -- at this time, there's limited repatriation of money, and we are -- where we see opportunities trying to invest the cash flows that are being generated in these markets back into those markets. So with that, it's not really costing us at this point. It certainly is costing us in terms of what we report. But as Jeff said, it's somewhat cost prohibitive for what is basically fixing a paper loss right now.\nMichael Rollins: And has that performance over the last few years in FX changed the way you approach international acquisitions in terms of hurdle rates or the types of assumptions that you're layering into the models?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. We continue to adopt increasingly higher foreign exchange hurdles as part of our modeling components.\nOperator: We'll now go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael: I'm glad everybody is doing well. First off, on the guidance, you mentioned that excluding the FX headwind, you actually would have increased your guidance, but you did mention that you had taken down your expectations for new leasing activity. I was just curious if you could explain where that would have been. And then secondly, on churn, I think going into 2020, the expectation in the United States was that churn would be elevated because of non big 3 elevated churn? Just curious if that number or assumption has changed.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Colby, on the guidance changes, so net of the FX, there is an increase to several of our metrics that we guide to, including leasing revenue. And the organic lease-up we did reduce slightly. The increases as a result of some of the other things, particularly in the first quarter, we had a strong out-performance in a variety of things, including certain onetime fees, and out-of-period billings, those sorts of things that were higher than expected. So that allowed us to increase the guidance for the full year, net of it.\nColby Synesael: And those things that will offset in the second quarter that we should be thinking about when we model? Or are they things that will recur again?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No. I mean we always have some of that stuff every quarter. And so one of the challenges is certainly for us to pinpoint exactly what it's going to be because it's not the typical recurring monthly payments that we get under the leases, which is the majority of our revenue. But there will be some amount of it, whether our assumptions in the first quarter were a little bit low, and it continues a little bit higher or that's the new normal, I don't know yet. But I think if you're modeling it out and you keep it in the same ballpark as what we saw in the first quarter, you'd be okay.  And then on the churn side, there wasn't really a material shift in the non-big 3 churn from what we talked about last quarter. In fact, our reported numbers, I think, quarter-over-quarter were very similar. They were flat.\nColby Synesael: So churn of roughly around, I think, 2%. Is that the number? I can't recall right now.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. For the U.S., 2020 would be somewhere around 2%.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSami Badri: Jeff, you've mentioned on prior earnings calls regarding M&A activity and potentially entertaining other deals in other regions. Now there have been several references on this conference call regarding slowdowns in decision-making and just the overall pace just slowing down. Would you say that your plans for any M&A or deal considerations have also slowed down for 2020, pushing them back a little bit or even potentially pushing them out to 2021?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I don't want to -- I don't want to over -- your comment, I think, overemphasizes the I hope I didn't convey that there's been too much of a slowdown because there really hasn't been so far. There's been little delays here and there. But there would be, I think, some potential -- much more larger difficulties in trying to execute an M&A deal in a new market in a geography where we've never been before. I mean some of these states are on lockdown and not allowing travelers to go into these countries. So when that -- I mean obviously, those things have to change before you would be able to even embark upon anything like that.  So I think there are just some practical limitations, which I don't think should surprise anybody who's been watching what's going on. That are going to be a little different this year until this situation all has a little bit more clarity, which will make the typical year of M&A a little more challenging for everybody than naught.\nOperator: At this time, we've exhausted all questions in the queue. You may continue.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I want to thank everyone for dialing in from probably their homes. And I do want to convey that our thoughts and our efforts are with the safety, not only here of our team members and our customers, but all of you out there on the call be safe, be well, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 8:00 p.m. Eastern this evening, through May 19 at midnight.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The first quarter was a solid start to the year financially and operationally for SBA. We produced leasing revenue, TCF and AFFO per share that were all well ahead of our expectations. Our domestic and international TCF margins as well as our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter were the highest in our company's history, and our AFFO per share growth on a constant currency basis of 13.5% over the first quarter of last year is evidence of the tremendous growth characteristics of our business, a very resilient predictable business. The solid growth gives us great confidence in continuing to invest in our business while paying out one of the fastest-growing dividends anywhere. We announced today our second quarterly dividend of the year at an annual -- excuse me, at an amount of 26% over our quarterly dividend paid in the second half of last year.  During the quarter, we were active both adding assets to our portfolio and repurchasing our stock. We invested over $100 million in new assets and repurchased $200 million of our stock. We were once again opportunistic in our share repurchase efforts, buying stock at an average price of $242.86.  While all of that certainly sounds great, our thoughts these days are largely consumed by COVID-19. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatic. We've all been affected in some way, including SBA. Our hearts go out to those that have lost loved ones or had health complications due to this virus. And we have also concern for those who have lost jobs or faced economic hardships due to the far-reaching shutdowns undertaken in response to the virus. Thankfully, we have only had a handful of team members test positive, which we're very fortunate for with the global workforce of almost 1,500 team members. And thankfully, they're all doing okay.  Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, SBA was not a telecommuting company. We learned to become a telecommuting company in 14 countries in less than a week. For those of our team members in essential jobs where they could not work from home, including all of our services team members working for our customers every day, we developed state of the art health and safety protocols with the constant assistance of medical professionals. I don't feel we've missed a beat, and I salute all of our team members for their dedication, service and commitment.  At SBA, we recognize both that we are fortunate to be in an industry that has proven resilient to the challenges of the current environment and that we have an obligation to support the communities in which we live and work. One thing that has become abundant and clear during this crisis is the tremendous importance of broadband and wireless connectivity, a cornerstone to the continued functioning of much of our society during this time of social distancing.  In recognition of this, we have supported our customers and their efforts to address the needs of our communities. Our tower crews have been on the front lines, installing equipment, checking equipment, performing maintenance and repairs, checking and resetting power systems and performing other site level tasks, not normally within SBA scope. We've ensured uninterrupted access to sites for authorized personnel 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  In many of our international markets, we've made cell on wheel solutions available to our customers at no charge. We've also accelerated payments to certain of our vendors facing hardships. We are busy. All of our team members remain fully employed, and we have recently added some employees in anticipation of a more active second half.  Finally, SBA has committed material financial resources to support charitable organizations in each of the domestic and international markets where we have offices. We believe it is important to support the communities where our team members live, work and raise their families. And we feel fortunate that we are able to do it. From a financial standpoint, our business continues to be strong during these challenging times. The impacts to our core business from COVID-19 have been minor, a few delays here and there. The only material negative impact we currently expect to our financial projections, as you heard from Brendan, is due to weaker foreign exchange rates in our largest international markets. We are hopeful that these rates will improve when the current crisis has eased. But for now, we continue to keep local cash flows in local markets supporting local operations, so there will be no impact to our day-to-day operations in those countries.  The bottom line is the future is very bright for SBA. In fact, as you heard from Brendan, but for foreign exchange adjustments, we would have been increasing our full year outlook in a number of important areas, including AFFO per share. We are financially healthy, well positioned in critical business and there are a number of growth drivers ahead of us.  One of those growth drivers is, of course, the new T-Mobile. With the closing of the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction now behind us, we are on the cusp of significant network investment by all of our U.S. customers. In order to meet their required 5G coverage goals, the new T-Mobile will require meaningful upgrades across their combined portfolio, deploying both 2.5 gigahertz spectrum and 600 megahertz spectrum. Post-merger discussions and early activity are underway.  Verizon and AT&T are each active in upgrades and network expansion for both 4G and 5G as well. In addition, AT&T's FirstNet build out continues in full swing and deployments of AWS 3 and WCS spectrum continue. We anticipate that both the CBRS and C-band spectrum auction scheduled for later this year will be highly competitive, and ultimately, a material driver of incremental growth for the tower industry, particularly the C-band auction. This critical mid-band spectrum is expected to be a key component of future 5G network deployments, and it will require the deployment of new equipment at many of our customers' existing macro sites.  On top of all this, DISH will be active investing heavily to meet their own 5G coverage commitments as they begin the build-out of a brand-new nationwide facilities-based wireless network. These major initiatives will all support continued growth for SBA for at least the next several years.  Internationally, we expect our business to remain steady. While some of our customers outside the U.S. may feel the impact of COVID-19 more than those in the U.S., at least in the short term, due to government-imposed consumer payment deferrals, the reason those deferrals were implemented in the first place is that wireless is and will remain the primary means of communications in these markets. Expanded wireless services capability and reliability required by the market and perhaps regulatory authority, are expected in these markets. Our current levels of activity and backlogs are very good, and absent some material change from this point forward, we anticipate a solid 2020 internationally.  From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very strong as well. We have plenty of liquidity and good access to incremental capital if needed. We remain a preferred issuer in each of the markets where we access capital, and that is even more the case in the current environment. I'm very comfortable with our current leverage level, and the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to continue to be opportunistic around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support our dividend.  Our dividend remains at a relatively low percentage of AFFO, providing us with great capital allocation opportunities. Our asset focus remains unchanged, whether macro towers, mobile edge, in building or other assets, we seek out exclusive multi-tenant mission-critical assets that will be essential for the needs of our customers today and tomorrow and will provide returns to SBA materially above our cost of capital. We are very focused on and pleased with our return on invested capital. Strength of our financial position shines through in times like these.  Finally, I'd like to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. We are all in this together. As I mentioned earlier, I could not be more proud of the way that the SBA team has come together in these challenging times, and performed at a very high level. With their continued contributions, I look forward to a solid and improving rest of the year. We have adjusted well and will continue to adjust well to the times, and we remain laser-focused on serving our customers and providing increasing returns to our shareholders.  Rich, with that, we are now ready for questions. Well, thanks, David. I hope you are well, you and your family. We know DISH is for real. They are extremely committed to this undertaking. There's a tremendous amount at stake and at-risk for Mr. Ergen and his shareholders, if they are not successful and they are certainly pursuing it in every way, shape and form to our visibility to be successful. We're very, very, very involved with them in all kinds of conversations. Recall from their prior disclosures that they expect this year to be a very, very big planning year with deployments really to commence next year.  So based on those comments, we have not included virtually anything in our leasing guidance and perhaps very little in our services guidance, but that does not mean that work relationships are not quite good and quite voluminous between the companies. And I wouldn't bet against him. We really didn't know. But now we have a lot greater visibility. And I think what we're seeing is that based on where both companies were, particularly with Sprint with their already somewhat deployed 2.5 G that will be the markets that T-Mobile will quickly gravitate to launch first because it's logical, and it just makes sense. So I don't know that there's any surprises there as much, David, as there is now starting to be some clarity. I think what we're experiencing so far, and again, none of it is COVID -- well, it is COVID-related, but none of it's material. Everything just seems to take a little bit longer. And when we talk about basically doubling the size of the industry's work with the T-Mobile stuff getting really cranked up, just hard for us to just think that there's not going to be some COVID-19 slowdowns. I can't name them all today, but it's just -- there has to be, right? So -- and the rest of the services thing was -- I mean if you look at our first quarter numbers, and it's going to be the same in the first -- in the second quarter, it's was somewhat behind where we thought it was going to be. Yes, I'm going to give some high-level comments, and I'm going to let Brendan give you some more detail. I mean, recall, Spencer, the way we report that metric, it's a trailing 12 and when Sprint/T-Mobile DISH pulled back, it was like August, September. So you had -- from September on, you had very reduced activity. You had it again in -- you had nothing basically from those guys in Q1. And you won't have really anything from them in Q2. So there's 3 quarters right there that do the kind of -- run the mental mathematical gyrations, and you'll see where things should trough out and then where they should begin to pick up again. So Brendan, do you want to hazard a guess as to exit rates? I'm not sure we want to do that. Well, when we didn't really have anything from T-Mobile and Sprint, it mathematically made up a better percentage of the quarterly pie, Simon, than it typically would. Now I do think there will be some continued activity from those carriers, but I do think it will also decline just because of the law of larger numbers as you see more of the T-Mobile activity come in through the year.  CBRS, I think, is primarily going to be mostly at in-building phenomena, but we are having some conversations with not only traditional wireless providers, but also cable companies about macro installations. But as between the 2 auctions, CBRS versus C-band, I think it's without question going to be a more exciting and more activity producing auction for us with respect to the C band. It's typical of both, and it does imply that we do the work on our own towers when it comes to amendments or co-locations. It's kind of historical relationships and some contracted relationships as well. No. That would not be a good thing for me to do, Phil. Well, recall that's a financial -- recall that's a financial number, not an operational number. So operationally, we expect to be extremely busy but those are -- go ahead, Brendan. Yes. Well, it is starting. It could go quick. Sprint did have -- I won't say a fair amount, but they do have some 2.5G out there already. I don't know if it's enough. It's certainly not enough to cover a nationwide iPhone launch. But I mean it -- I think the main thing to keep in mind, Walt, is the numbers that you read are financial -- they come off the financials. But when we talk about pickups and activity, that's the stuff, that's the signing and the dirt being turned and things like that. And the financial results trail all that stuff. Well, we got a lot to do. We exceeded -- got close to 10% at the end of last year. So we've kind of started off with some lower levels of activity. And you could see where those numbers are now. There's plenty of stuff out there, Nick, and that continues to be our goal. I don't think we will repeat last year's percentage levels, which I believe were close to 10%. But we're still shooting for at least the 5%, and there's enough out there to be done. But like we always do, we want the right assets. That is one, probably more visible aspect of COVID-19 than perhaps -- that new builds, I mean, a lot of the land purchase things require notorization. Well, you can't leave your house, you can't get things notarized. So that's a very tangible area of the business that has seen some delays. And just to add in. Internationally, most of those deals require an in-person negotiation with the landowners, and that obviously is being limited as well. So it definitely is having an impact. Yes. Yes. Yes. So we think there will be some balance there over the course of the year. Yes. Our leases are spectrum specific, Mike. But given why that spectrum is going to be provided in times of a national emergency and to be used to help us all get through this. Provided that's what it's being used for, and it goes back at some point. I don't know that we're going to charge for that. Now if it requires additional equipment to be utilized in new radios and new antennas. But if it's just to help people get through, and there's no new equipment required, even though we could charge for it, we're probably not going to charge for that.  In terms of foreign currency, we have spent many sleepless nights looking for P&L hedges, but they are -- they are cost prohibitive. The only real hedges that work are when you are purchasing an asset in advance, you can hedge your dollars going in. And then the other hedges to borrow in local currency. But in terms of what I think you're talking about looking for to purchase a P&L hedge, there is not one out there that is -- makes cost sense. Yes. We continue to adopt increasingly higher foreign exchange hurdles as part of our modeling components. Well, I don't want to -- I don't want to over -- your comment, I think, overemphasizes the I hope I didn't convey that there's been too much of a slowdown because there really hasn't been so far. There's been little delays here and there. But there would be, I think, some potential -- much more larger difficulties in trying to execute an M&A deal in a new market in a geography where we've never been before. I mean some of these states are on lockdown and not allowing travelers to go into these countries. So when that -- I mean obviously, those things have to change before you would be able to even embark upon anything like that.  So I think there are just some practical limitations, which I don't think should surprise anybody who's been watching what's going on. That are going to be a little different this year until this situation all has a little bit more clarity, which will make the typical year of M&A a little more challenging for everybody than naught. Well, I want to thank everyone for dialing in from probably their homes. And I do want to convey that our thoughts and our efforts are with the safety, not only here of our team members and our customers, but all of you out there on the call be safe, be well, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. Well, SBA had another solid quarter operationally and financially. And given the unprecedented events occurring around the globe, we feel both pleased and fortunate to be able to report our results.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $492.3 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $490 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $2.7 million headwind to revenues when compared with our internal estimates for the first quarter. They were also a headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2019.  Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.6% over the first quarter of 2019, including the impact of 2.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 7.6% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 2.1% of churn, 0.7% of which was related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was slower than the year ago period and similar to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to T-Mobile, Sprint and DISH, awaiting resolution of the legal challenges to the Sprint/T-Mobile merger and the ultimate closing of the merger.  Amendment activity was again, the large majority of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 84% from amendments and 16% from new leases. Despite the lack of contribution from T-Mobile and Sprint, the big 4 carriers, now big 3 carriers still represented 79% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. We did have some nice contributions to domestic leasing activity from a couple of regional carriers.  Our domestic application backlog remains strong, and we expect that with the closing of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger now behind us, we will soon begin to see a significant increase in incremental leasing activity. Early activity post-merger has finally begun.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.1%, including 0.5% of churn or 8.6% on a gross basis. Leasing activity internationally was largely in line with expectations for the quarter. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to international lease-up, and we continue to see contributions from all 4 major carriers there.  Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 10.8% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 84.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.8% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.6% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $398.1 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash flow margin was 84.2% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 70.4% and was 90.5%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $369.9 million. Our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.9% in the quarter up 150 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.7%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. Our first quarter tower cash flow margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were both record highs for SBA. AFFO in the first quarter was $259.9 million. AFFO per share was $2.28, an increase of 10.1% over the first quarter of 2019 and a 13.5% increase on a constant currency basis.  During the first quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio, acquiring 69 communication sites for $79.9 million and building a total of 49 sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase 137 additional sites at an aggregate price of $52 million, which sites we anticipate closing by the end of the third quarter. We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $6.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years, the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years.  In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year 2020. The most material changes to our outlook are the result of significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we initially provided our 2020 outlook. The weakening of the Brazilian real, South African rand and Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, have caused us to revise our estimates for these currency exchange rates for the balance of 2020.  The combination of these estimate changes and the actual first quarter exchange rates relative to our prior assumptions, have negatively impacted our outlook for site leasing revenue by $47 million. Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were negatively impacted by $32 million, $30 million and $29 million, respectively, due to these updated exchange rate assumptions. AFFO per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.26. Excluding the impact of these foreign currency-related adjustments, we raised our full year outlook for leasing revenue, tower cash flow and AFFO per share. Even with the T-Mobile-Sprint merger-related overall industry slowdown in the U.S. in the second half of last year and year-to-date this year, we still anticipate another year of solid growth in our leasing business. Although primarily concentrated in the second half of this year. We raised our full year domestic leasing revenue expectations, although we have made a minor reduction to the anticipated contribution from new leasing activity, both domestically and internationally, due primarily to a conservative view around the possible impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  While these are immaterial changes, and we haven't seen any material delays to date, it is impossible today to say with certainty that there will not be some minor impact from COVID-19 somewhere in our business this year.  Similarly, with regard to our services business, we have lowered our full year revenue outlook largely due to potential impacts from COVID-19 and slower activity levels in the first half of the year, pending the expected lift from T-Mobile post-merger. Our full year outlook still contemplates a pickup in our leasing and services businesses in the second half of the year, particularly now that the Sprint/ T-Mobile merger has closed. Our customers have a ton to do, and it is apparent to us in our backlogs, and in our discussions with them. As a result, we remain excited about not only 2020, but the next several years of activity.  I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Well, we have MLAs in place with both T-Mobile and Sprint, which continue to be in place. Now I don't know that they're entirely perfect or totally all covering the things that now need to be covered, but they do cover quite a bit. So the answer is no. We don't need any of that to do the things that we've reflected in our outlook. Well, it could be done a lot quicker than that. Yes, I would certainly think it would be months and not quarters. Yes. No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you've already suggested spencer that you've calculated based on the revenue bridge and our supplemental package, what the full year number is. And if you're looking at it domestically, that number is lower than what we reported for the first quarter. And that's because you will see a lot of the impact that Jeff was just talking about that's happening in the first quarter and into the second quarter, it will continue to drive a trailing 12 months number down, even though we expect activity levels from a leasing standpoint to pick up in the second half of the year, the financial impact of that will not be felt until we get to next year. So I think you should assume that the exit rate is somewhere around what we have projected there for the full year, maybe slightly below that, actually, but accelerating from that point forward would be our expectation. Yes. You should expect that it will continue to decline, because that's, again, a trailing 12-month number as well. So it will continue to step down because there's not that much left. We've probably got about $4 million or so of annualized revenue from them that we expect to churn off over the next few quarters, I'd say. So it's stepping down already. So that percentage will be lower by the end of the year. Well, we actually reduced that number slightly to 47, Walt, in the... Yes. But we -- if you look at that, obviously, it implies that, that number goes down. And again, that's trailing 12 months. So if you calculate it out for the balance of the year, we're expecting that 7.6% to be lower in future quarters. And it is lower than it was -- that is a step down. In the fourth quarter, that gross number was 8.2%, and I think the quarter before that was 8.6%. So it's stepping down basically based on what we've seen since mid third quarter last year, which was kind of a stop by T-Mobile, in particular. Yes. I mean, where Jeff is going, they don't commence until later. You said in the third and fourth quarter. But we're just now starting to have activity pick back up with them. We've not been signing anything with T-Mobile basically year-to-date, including going back a quarter and a half of last year. So all the things that start to happen now, even if we become very busy from this point forward and you layer on a commencement date to that, that's typically several months after it's signed up. It's very limiting in its impact for this year. But we do it--. I mean, listen, it could be. They could be more aggressive and faster than what it's historically been, but we're not projecting that because we don't have that -- any evidence of that at this point in terms of a timing. We sign a $1 million... It usually commences paying once they've installed and turned it on usually when they usually sync up. It doesn't always work that way. It could be that they are paying earlier because there's a drop-dead date. But typically, those 2 things align. Now we also think that there will be some more willing sellers. We do try to -- at this time, there's limited repatriation of money, and we are -- where we see opportunities trying to invest the cash flows that are being generated in these markets back into those markets. So with that, it's not really costing us at this point. It certainly is costing us in terms of what we report. But as Jeff said, it's somewhat cost prohibitive for what is basically fixing a paper loss right now. Yes, Colby, on the guidance changes, so net of the FX, there is an increase to several of our metrics that we guide to, including leasing revenue. And the organic lease-up we did reduce slightly. The increases as a result of some of the other things, particularly in the first quarter, we had a strong out-performance in a variety of things, including certain onetime fees, and out-of-period billings, those sorts of things that were higher than expected. So that allowed us to increase the guidance for the full year, net of it. No. I mean we always have some of that stuff every quarter. And so one of the challenges is certainly for us to pinpoint exactly what it's going to be because it's not the typical recurring monthly payments that we get under the leases, which is the majority of our revenue. But there will be some amount of it, whether our assumptions in the first quarter were a little bit low, and it continues a little bit higher or that's the new normal, I don't know yet. But I think if you're modeling it out and you keep it in the same ballpark as what we saw in the first quarter, you'd be okay.  And then on the churn side, there wasn't really a material shift in the non-big 3 churn from what we talked about last quarter. In fact, our reported numbers, I think, quarter-over-quarter were very similar. They were flat. Yes. For the U.S., 2020 would be somewhere around 2%."

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark Derussy: Good evening. And thank you for joining us for SBA's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeffrey Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations.

In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our fourth-quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA finished 2021 with our best quarter of the year. The quarter included financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into 2022. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $539.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $529.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a headwind, though, on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $2.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.7% of churn.  On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.7%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.3% on a gross basis and 3.9% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was at its highest level of the year, this was the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of executions, we continued to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at year-end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 48% of our domestic bookings, with 52% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.  In the fourth quarter, reported domestic site leasing revenue was slightly impacted by the timing of revenue commencements versus our internal estimates, primarily with regard to new DISH leases. This is a timing issue only as the number of leases executed exceeded our expectations. During the quarter, we also had slightly less domestic churn than our internal estimates due to delays in timing versus our prior estimates. Internationally on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.3% net, including 4.4% of churn or 8.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again and was at the highest level of the year. As anticipated, the impact of international churn increased in the quarter as we began to see greater impacts from carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. Although there were some churn timing delays that resulted in slightly lower reported international churn for 2021 than we previously forecasted.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.8% on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter, 84.9% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.3% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $434.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remained very strong, with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.1% or 91.6%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $409.1 million.  The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.5%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business produced record results for the third quarter in a row with $55.9 million in revenue and $12.9 million of segment operating profit. Notwithstanding these record results, we were able to completely replenish our services backlogs finishing the year at an equal level to our company all-time high backlog from September 30th. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we are projecting another very strong contribution from our services business in 2022, AFFO in the fourth quarter was $310.8 million. AFFO per share was $2.81, an increase of the 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2020 on a constant currency basis.  During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 59 communication sites for total cash consideration of $38.4 million. We also built 88 new sites in the quarter, including our first seven sites built in our new markets the Philippines. Jeff will touch on our expansion into the Philippines in a moment. Subsequent to quarter end on January fourth, we closed on our previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. This transaction added 1445 sites to our tower portfolio at a cash purchase price of a $176.1 million. And the impact of this transaction is fully included in our 2022 full year outlook. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 371 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $137.1 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter.  In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $13.6 million to buy land and easements, and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2022. Our outlook reflects a significant increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments. This increased organic leasing contribution is largely due to the increased pace of new leasing activity we experienced during 2021, as well as some contributions from anticipated continued strong organic leasing activity during 2022.  Our outlook for contributions from new leases and amendments is based in part on estimates of lease commencement timing with each of our customers, and shifts in the timing of equipment installations may have minor impacts on these estimates as they did in the fourth-quarter. We are also projecting increases in contributions from contractual escalations. Most of the increase is projected in our international markets, where inflationary increases are expected to drive increased rental escalations. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2022. The primary increases in connection with anticipated Sprint related decommissioning. Our outlook incorporates a current estimate of approximately $30 million of churn in 2022 related to legacy Sprint leases. And our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remains unchanged. Our total churn projections for 2022 are based in part on internal estimates of a variety of factors that can impact the timing of actual revenue cease dates.  To the extent that there are variances from these internal estimates, there may be impacts on our reported 2022 churn. However, any differences reported 2022 churn from these variances is a tiny issue and does not change our expectations for long-term aggregate churn. In addition to Sprint churn, our outlook includes increased churn in our international markets, primarily due to carrier consolidation in Central America. Our full-year 2022 outlook includes the projected impact of the Tanzania acquisition, but it does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. The outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today.  However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022, however, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and our cost of debt. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $110 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We're very excited about 2022, our customers are all very active and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. And with that, I will now turn things back over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark Derussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt, and $12 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times. Our fourth-quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was five times -- 5.0 times, the highest in the company's history. During the fourth quarter, the company, through an existing trust, issued $895 million of 1.84% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-2C, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 9th, 2027, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2051. In addition, $895 million of 2.593% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-3C, which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9th, 2031, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2056. The aggregate $1.79 billion of these Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.217%, and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 7.8 years.  Also during the fourth quarter, the company repaid at par the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-2C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of April 11th, 2023. And we also redeem the entire aggregate $1.1 billion principal amount of the 2016, 4.875% senior notes, as well as paid all premiums and costs associated with such redemption. As of the end of the year, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years. And the interest rate on 97% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $560 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 786,000 shares of our common stock for $263.6 million at an average price per share of $335.26. Subsequent to year-end, we repurchased an additional 1.047 million shares for $350 million at an average price per share of $334.40.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average price of $318.59 per share. All of the shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $586.4 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 were $109 million compared to $109.8 million at December 31, 2020, a reduction of 0.8%. Pro forma for the repurchases after year-end, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7%. In addition, during the fourth quarter we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.1 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, an increase of 22. 4% over last quarter payable on March 25, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2022. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 25% of fourth-quarter AFFO per share. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a very strong finish to the year, again, generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. We produced record results in several categories, and we're set up well for a very strong 2022. 2021 lease up activity levels were ahead of plan in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. market was particularly strong with the highest level of organic new leasing revenue per tower signed up in over seven years during the fourth-quarter, T-Mobile remained extremely busy investing in their continued nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. DISH continued signing up a large number of new lease agreements in support of their brand-new nationwide 5G network. Verizon continued its ramp up for their C-band deployments and AT&T remained a steady contributor.  These significant activity levels have also translated into meaningful use services results, where we produced record services, revenue and margin results for the third quarter in a row. Domestic activity has remained strong through the first two months of 2022. And both our leasing and services backlogs have remained very healthy. Not withstanding the solid fourth quarter results we produced in both segments of the business. Based on this backlog commentary from our largest U.S. customers disclosing robust capital expenditure plans for 2022 and the size and scope of our customers 5G deployment plans, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing and services activities throughout 2022 into 2023, and perhaps beyond. Internationally, we had our strongest leasing quarter of the year. Demand remains high in many of our largest international markets, and we expect to continue to see it remains strong throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we signed up 68% of new international revenue through new leases, and 32% through amendments to existing leases. We had strong leasing results in Central America, Brazil, and South Africa.  In addition, the recent 5G spectrum auction in Brazil and the upcoming 5G spectrum auction and South Africa give us confidence that we will continue to see increasing network investment, and thus leasing demand throughout our largest international markets. We're also excited about the potential from our two newest international markets. In early January, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of over 1400 sites from Airtel Tanzania. We believe this market has great promise for us not only in terms of organic lease-up on our acquired sites, but also in terms of new tower build opportunities. Significant wireless investment will be needed over the upcoming years. And we are well-positioned to support our customers in Tanzania, and participate in the growth of wireless throughout this market. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we built our first brand-new greenfield sites in the Philippines. The Philippines is a market that we have studied for a number of years, and we're very excited about the prospects for favorable growth over the next few years. We have established operations in the market, opening a local office, hiring staff, working with the appropriate government agencies for all necessary permits, and establishing strong positive relationships with each of the three major mobile network operators in the market. We are initially and primarily focused on a greenfield new build strategy in the Philippines, and we anticipate the demand to support significant new tower build numbers for the next several years. We believe are significant long-standing tower operation expertise will provide meaningful value to our customers in this market and will give us a competitive advantage. I look forward to sharing results with you in the future as we continue to grow in the Philippines.  Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we believe 2022 will be a very good year. Throughout the last year, we have done an excellent job with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. During the last year, we have completed a number of significant low-cost refinancings which have meaningfully improved our balance sheet positioning, particularly ahead of a period with potentially increasing interest rates. Our early refinancing of several of our outstanding debt securities during 2021 extended out maturity dates and produced the lowest weighted average interest rate in our company's history at 2.6%. The substantial majority of our interest costs has also locked in at fixed rates. We have continued to target our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage in a range of 7 to 7.5 earns, and have invested the available capital produced by that strategy into portfolio growth and share repurchases.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have grown our site portfolio by over 8%, and we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our outstanding stock. We have also been able to continue to meaningfully increase our quarterly dividend. Today, announcing an increase in our dividend of over 22%, while still retaining over 75% of our projected AFFO for additional discretionary investment. We believe that all of these factors will be additive to AFFO per share. And as a result, shareholder value creation. I'd like to take a moment to reflect on full-year results. They were very good. Year-over-year, we grew cash site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO per share by 6.3%, 6.5%, 7.6%, and 13.9% respectively. We posted industry-leading tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins of 81.7% and 70.5%. Beyond the impressive growth rates and margins, the quality of revenue and cash flow shine through backed by predominately U.S. macro towers in our services segment, we had a banner year finishing 2021 with $205 million in revenue and $46 million in gross profit among the highest in company history.  Each quarter throughout the year, SBA posted sequentially higher results are a reflection of the tremendous activity we're seeing from our customers with little signs of slowing. We allocated over $2 billion in 2021 with Alliance Share going towards acquisitions and new builds, share repurchases and dividends. We added 991,335 sites through acquisitions and new builds, respectively in the year, following that, on January 4th, with over 1400 sites acquired in Tanzania. Finally, we published our second corporate sustainability report at the end of the year. Evidencing our continued focus on and success in environmental, social, and governance matters. We take great pride in our performance throughout 2021 and we're very excited about the upcoming year.  The current operating environment for our industry and our internal excellence of operational execution combined to give us great confidence that we will produce very strong results this year. And I believe our full year 2022 outlook provided in today's earnings release supports that confidence. Our customers are all very busy, and we believe we are well-positioned to help them achieve their operational and network goals. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and contributions to our success, and I look forward to sharing our 2022 results with you as we move through the year. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Okay. . Our first question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Two things. So for -- can you just talk about what's built-in for DISH and AT&T in the current guide.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, we're not going to get too specific, Phil, but we -- there will -- DISH has rolled over quite a bit of activity that will be in our outlook as revenues for 2022. I'll speak generally with AT&T and really just track their public comments, which is that they anticipate a step-up in their level of activity when the 3.45 equipment becomes available midyear, so that they can combine that with C-band equipment and do a one-stop or a one truck roll stop. So if -- I mean, knowing our history and knowing that you really need all your leasing activity in the first nine months of the year to impact that fiscal year's results. I would say you have more probably in there from DISH as opposed to any kind of incremental step-up this fiscal year for AT&T, although we would certainly expect to see that quite a bit greater in 2023.\nPhil Cusick: Okay. And then second, if I can, anything we should think about in terms of site development, either front-loaded or back-loaded, and the current guide anywhere? Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: I think it's matching up pretty well with anticipating where leasing revenue is and will be headed for at least the next couple of quarters. So I think it's a current to two quarter forward look at activity.\nPhil Cusick: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks. To about M&A, if you don't mind. And first now that you're in the Philippines, I understand you're mostly going to be doing that through greenfield builds, but how are you thinking about that as maybe a beachhead for broader expansion across Asia and what is the M&A opportunities look like over there? And then just on the data center side of things you've gotten further into operating a very small portfolio. We've clearly seen some of your peers get bigger, a few M&A in the data center space. Are you at a point where you're thinking that might become a more interesting priority for your capital allocation, or do you still think that this is mostly a bit of a niche period for as you understand the synergy between those assets and your tower assets? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. In Southeast Asia, there's a number of opportunities, Brett. Carrier dispositions we think will be coming. And just like anywhere else in the world, we will look at that mostly from its financial sensibilities, not that anything strategic as we know necessarily combines North America with the Far East or anywhere in between. So just like with every other decision we make, it will be primarily made on its financial attributes. But having said that, we would love to continue to grow, and that is our goal and remains our number one priority is using capital to grow the portfolio. The second question --\nBrett Feldman: Data centers.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. I think we're going to -- you're going to continue to see our current pattern of behavior remaining there. We like data centers. But in terms of a big investment, much bigger than kind of what we've been doing it, we'd really have to get to the point where it was absolutely clear that there were great synergies and the data centers would lead to expanded activity at tower site. And while there are certain pieces of evidence to force that, it has not really been proven out yet. So I think it's going to be the latter of the two pass that you framed in your question. And we will continue to learn the business and grow the business very, very modestly. It actually has turned out to be very good so far in the two that we've had. We've had demands for increased capacity. We're actually investing additional capital to grow the capacity in both Jacksonville and Chicago, and that's based on contracted tenant demand. So I mean, so far so good, but not -- it's not material today. It won't be material this year. And we'll see where it goes in the future.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, over line of Michael Rollins with Citi, please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Well, thanks and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, Jeff, you're describing some of the visibility and the demand picture in 2023 and beyond. Just curious how's your visibility today different maybe from times in the past. And if there's a sense of the type of average growth, investors should be expecting over the next few years. And then just on the balance sheet on target leverage, just given some of the recent changes in rate, just curious what your current perspective is on target net debt leverage, maybe in the current year and then over time.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah, in terms of visibility, Mike, it hasn't really changed that much in our views around -- and the comments really about this year's activity going into 2023 really are a combination of what our customers have said as to how many sites that they're going to be able to get to this year. What their capital plans are, and what our own internal backlogs are showing. And basically to over simplify it, there's going to be a lot of work still left to do by the end of this year. So that's what gives us confidence about 2023 and not sure it will all be done by the end of 2023. So average growth rates over the next year. I mean, I think on a gross basis, you're still looking at the mid-to-high single. The budgets that we've been, we've been talking about, we feel good about that.  And in terms of leverage, we've talked about this a lot over time. 60 basis point movement in the 10-year, while it seemingly had done quite a bit of impact to our trading multiple. It really doesn't impact the way we think about structure and capital allocation and balance sheet. So we're not really changed anything today based on where the 10-year is now if -- hopefully it doesn't. But if it goes up materially from here, we have to revisit that. The fact that we do pay a dividend puts a little bit more caution and conservatism and where we ultimately want to take leverage or maintain leverage and an increasing rate environment. But the movement that we've seen so far this year really has it caused us to rethink any of the big picture balance sheet structural points.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James, please go ahead.\nRichard Prentiss: Good afternoon everybody.\nJeffrey Stoops: Hey, Rick.\nRichard Prentiss:  questions. Jeff, on Dish's call last week, Charlie Ergen mentioned how in the future maybe there is some ability to share spectrum, particularly in that 3.45 DoD spectrum band, but maybe some of the other spectrum bands as well. How do you guys look at that, and how do you actually even monitor it.\nJeffrey Stoops: There are certain filings that would allow you to monitor it. You have to work at it. But there is a certain reliance on customer transparency, because all the leases really talk only about deploying and using spectrum that is owned or controlled by the lessee. So that's really not -- it's not something that would be allowed under our current leases without some additional discussions and modifications to the lease. But in terms of actually -- it's not like there's necessarily going to be new equipment on the tower to do that. But you would be able to figure that out through RF tests based on each customer's signal strength in that particular area. And if they're not on the tower officially, but for some reason they're broadcasting as a strong signal of 3.45, you know you've got a sharing issue.\nRichard Prentiss: I think you also called out that obviously CPI is going to be up, escalators in LatAm. Quickly, math suggests, instead of being in the fours, you might be in the sixes. But where does CPI go and how should we think about the pacing in Latin America or all your international markets on what we should think I've been CPI in escalators, Brendan?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Rick, I mean, they're obviously the majority of our international escalators are in Brazil. Brazil and South Africa being our largest markets. We do have some concentration of leases and a couple of time periods during the year based on acquisitions that we've done over the years and the leaseback associated with those. But otherwise over time, it's fairly well evenly spread in. So we've put in certain basic assumptions for purposes of guidance, obviously, some of those are our best estimate today as to where it will be at the point that the biggest escalator concentration happens. But I think that they are reasonable, if not, maybe a touch conservative.\nRichard Prentiss: And those concentration points, are they more in the middle of the year? I'm trying to remember back from some of those old acquisitions.\nJeffrey Stoops: I mean, one of them is in the late spring and one is in the late fall.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And last one for me, you also touched on that Sprint churn is not going to be as low in the current calendar year '22 as might have been first thought. Can you update us and just remind us, what is the cumulative Sprint churn you're expecting and can you give us a feeling as far as how much you're thinking right now, might hit '23 or '24?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. Our assumptions right now are pretty much the same as what we've disclosed before. When we talked about '22 in last year when we gave our projections for it, we said we'd be somewhere in the $30 or $35 million range. We actually are thinking we're somewhere on the lower end of that right now based on just some slight movements in timing around various decommissionings and stuff. So all that means is that that probably rolls into next year, our projections for '23 and '24 that we've given before are $10 million to $20 million in each year. That's still the case. But obviously if numbers shift in '22 at all, that would slightly affect '23. But really, we have a fairly small level of churn expected for the next couple of years. Before we see our bigger years, which --\nRichard Prentiss: After this year?\nJeffrey Stoops: -- yes, after this year, which '25 and '26 are the bigger years where we expect to see the majority of our Sprint related churn.\nRichard Prentiss: Makes sense. Thanks for the extra color, we'll see you guys next week.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed, please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Jeff, I just paid like $600 to have Roto-Rooter clear a drain for me, which I'm pretty sure was double the last time I had to do it. Can you give us a sense of the labor market and whether that's having any impact and all the construction activities of these telcos out there and whether you think that has any impact on their speed at the moment?\nJeffrey Stoops: Walter, that is more information than I needed to hear.\nWalter Piecyk: But it was amazing. At $600 to have a drain , I couldn't fucking believe it. The point is that we're all seeing this. We're all seeing our expenses go up. It\u2019s not -- who knows how transitory it is. But are the operators, are they playing these games? When you look at the services, businesses, do you think this has any impact on the business? A lot of times you in the last couple of quarters, you guys meaning collectively the tower industry and to all, it's not a big deal everything fine. It's just hard to believe given what we see in the market right now that that's not having some impact on it.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. And it is having some impact in absolute terms, but we are -- I think we're managing it pretty well. So here's what's going on. So there is wage pressure everywhere. So in the services business, we generally work on fixed fees. In the site consulting business, which is the zoning business. In the construction business, though, which was most of the revenue, and will be this year, that's all bid. And it's bid contemporaneously, so we're able to pass a lot of that on, assuming we win the bid. So we're actually managing it okay. I mean, it has started over a year ago and we're very happy with the profits and the margins that we're producing in that business and our outlook implies that we're going to do it again. So yes, it is happening, but we are managing it in a good way, some of which gets passed on through to the customer because of the bid process than the way the work is awarded.\nWalter Piecyk: When you said I think it was Phil at asked about dish and I think you used the term rolled over to did that. When you say rolled over to that, does that mean that that was lease revenue that maybe a little while ago you thought would have hit in 2021 analysis going to be hitting in 2022 instead, is that what you mean by rolled over?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Yes, it means we the leases -- the leasing activity has been tremendous. The revenue recognition on those leases lags based on either a fixed end day or the earlier of construction. So that's where we managed and estimate that, we were estimating a little bit higher last year. But the reality is the leases are signed up, they rolled over into this year, and it gives us obviously, solid confidence for where DISH's revenue contribution will be this year.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. My last question is --\nJeffrey Stoops: Leases that were signed up that had not been done accruing revenue in 2021?\nWalter Piecyk: Right. So just better visibility for '22.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah.\nWalter Piecyk: So my last question on the  policy, I think you had mentioned in the prepared comments, you highlighted 25% of AFFO per share. Obviously 20% growth was good. So I think about like a company like Cogent, which gets a very elevated evaluation. It's because they --  goes out there and predictably says like the same dividend increase every quarter. So is the 25% of AFFO per share, is that what we should just use as kind of a benchmark and then yield investors can just look at AFFO and then just predict the dividend growth as a result of the growth of the AFFO per share? Or does that make more sense maybe --\nJeffrey Stoops: No, I think we will grow. I think what we have done we will continue to do, which is grow our dividend faster than our AFFO per share growth. Now we have that luxury because we started with a low payout. And on a yield basis, it's still low. But as we've always said, going back to before we paid a dividend, while we want to pay a dividend to expand the base of our Investor universe. We believe that we will make our shareholders more money by keeping the money inside the company and compounding it through portfolio growth and stock repurchases.\nWalter Piecyk: Right. So why not then, rather than like try to say, hey, we're growing at faster . Just put -- like just tell the yield investor it will grow minimum x percent, whether that's 10%,15%, whatever the number is you want to pick. And then just give them a very predictable growth rate that you can bring all these people in in order to drive the stock.\nJeffrey Stoops: We have talked about a -- an amount of growth in five-year increments. And I think we've talked about 20% annually.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. We've said, I mean, in the past, we've been pretty clear that we expect to grow it for the next several years by at least 20% per year. And I guess we've done --\nWalter Piecyk: I guess you just need to repeat it on your prepared remarks every quarterly like Dave does, and then you can get that benefit. Okay. Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Del Deo: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. I guess, first, Jeff, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about your aspirations for the Philippines. Maybe a bit more about the magnitude of the Greenfield opportunity over the coming years, and maybe describe a little the competition you are seeing or expect to see because if I'm not mistaken, several other tower codes have jumped into that market too since it opened up. And then second -- sorry, go ahead.\nJeffrey Stoops: I was going to answer your question, but.\nNicholas Del Deo: Oh, sure. Sure.\nJeffrey Stoops: So the Philippines has a 110 million people and growing. And they have about 24,000 cell sites. So there is a huge opportunity based on those numbers to expand wireless networks. And a lot of greenfield sites will need to be built. The market we like it from a stability point of view, from a land use or regulation point of view, there are over 20 tower companies in country. We know that because you have to get a license to operate as a tower company in the Philippines. But we think there's only five or six of them, including us, that are strong and have the confidence of the customers to get meaningful build-to-suit opportunities going forward. We found the customers in the Philippines to be very smart and very careful in terms of who they partner with. And I think those are the kinds of relationships where our history, experience, and our people on the ground will distinguish themselves and we will excel. So I think thousands of towers will be built in the Philippines every year for the next 10 years. And I think if we get our fair share, that will build a nice business there.\nNicholas Del Deo: Okay, that's terrific, and it sounds like the headline competition may not be as intense as it first seems, which is good to hear.\nJeffrey Stoops: The numbers are higher. The folks with real capabilities, though, are much lower.\nNicholas Del Deo: Got it. And then maybe second question. You've repurchased a lot of stock so far in 2022, maybe just some updated thoughts on the relative appeal of M&A versus repurchases here? And maybe any general observations about trends in the M&A market and what you are saying?\nJeffrey Stoops: Based on $303 stock price in the midpoint of our guidance, that's a 26 times AFFO per share multiple if I'm not mistaken. And that currently -- while I think there is some rationalization going on in the markets, both domestic and internationally. There are a number of transactions that are selling for quite a bit more than that on a multiple basis. So that should lead you to conclude that while we continue to want to grow our portfolio and we'll make every effort to do that. We will do it only in those circumstances where it makes financial sense. And that stock repurchases at today's price relative to private market values are extremely attractive.\nNicholas Del Deo: Got it, that's great. Thank you, Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Greg Williams with Cowen please go ahead.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one just on the international guide, looks like Tanzania is contributing about $45 million in revenue. But how much is being contributed in terms of EBITDA and AFFO per share for Tanzania? Second question is just more philosophical on the telco versus cloud debate. There's an ongoing debate of cloud providers offering network-as-a-service  in the fray. Does that lighten up the equipment load for you guys? Maybe not the top of the towers, but at the bottom of the towers, and how do you see that dynamic unfolding? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: The contribution from Tanzania is approximately $22 million to EBITDA, and will be very similar to AFFO.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And on your second question, I mean, we have always thought of ourselves, first and foremost, as houses and housing antennas, radios. So while there is some movement as to the compute, that's going on at the tower site, we really haven't seen that impacted and it really doesn't impact our thoughts in terms of antenna and radio locations so far lots going on there. We really don't see or expect a material impact, at least in terms of the way we structure leases and think about our business.\nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I have two questions. So the first one is regarding just the wage inflation conversation you had earlier. Now, we all are operating with this idea that prices and costs of labor are going to be reduced or normalize. But what if they don't. What measures will you have to take if they don't actually normalize and this new pricing level is actually the new normal.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, we will do what we always do, which is take a fine pencil and work through the aspects of our costs where we can do something about it. In some cases, we may be able to improve upon that and in some cases we won't. What is good though in this conversations is people to realize how small, frankly for us compared to other businesses that these changes can really have in our bottom line because of the 70% plus EBITDA margin. We have great operating leverage in this business, and thankfully we've demonstrated over the years and that continues to be true about that a little amount of people can manage and operate a lot of towers. So we have that going for us, but we'll do what we always do, we'll execute and make changes as necessary to make sure we have the best team on the field at the best possible expense levels for the company.\nSami Badri: And then maybe just for us to know because there are some new contracts in place with the amylase and all the telcos more formalizing what they plan on spending or what they prefer to spend. So does the fact that there are MLA s in place make the renegotiation process more complex or no difference at all?\nJeffrey Stoops: It makes things much less complex in terms of the business that you're doing with your counterparty during the life of the MLA. Not sure I got your question. The renegotiation of what? With employees or the renegotiation of an MLA?\nSami Badri: Renegotiation of the MLA, and the fees you're getting, the contributing payments from your customer, and relatively matching the wage inflation against price. So just managing your margin just to get an idea on where you're going to be turning the levers.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, when we get to that point, that certainly will be a consideration. But I would just say, I think you focused on something that we don't believe will be a material issue at all. And I think if you look at our outlook, you'll see increasing margins.\nSami Badri: Maybe I can just add to that, that our actual cash SGNA is about 6% of our total revenues. So it's impact from a personnel standpoint is not that much. Our largest expense on our tower business or our ground leases, which also have -- they have fixed escalators. So that's an expense that can be controlled. It doesn't adjust with any of these inflationary pressures that you're talking about.\nJeffrey Stoops: I hope you can tell from our comments, Sami, that we don't really worry about that that much, and we're fully aware of where the market is today and where it might go.\nSami Badri: Absolutely. I just -- these are questions that I get on my side, so I was just hoping I could run them by you guys. The other kind of question I actually do get as well from investors. I was hoping you could share your take on is you are very focused on emerging market opportunities, seen by the acquisitions and the announcements you've made. And then there are just -- your competitors going after, or your competitor going after developing -- or developed markets, sorry, within the European region. And that seems to be a very compelling and digestible opportunity in the wake of international and geopolitical dynamics. Is there a reason why you guys haven't really tilted on the European side as an opportunity for M&A, rather than sticking to emerging markets.\nJeffrey Stoops: It's entirely due to our assessment of return on invested capital for those opportunities versus what we believe we will achieve in Tanzania, Philippines, and markets like that. We've talked a lot, Sami, over the years about how we liked the European market. But when you look at what -- who is competing for assets over there. And the fact that a number of them are -- they denominate their investors and their results in euros, and you can borrow euros, at least you could. I'm not sure what today is, but you could borrow at less than zero. It just became a market that we did not find compelling from an investment perspective and from shareholder value creation perspective. Is it otherwise a good market, sure.\nSami Badri:  Well, thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street, please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hey, thanks. On the $65 million of domestic new leasing activity this year, I believe if you hit that, that'd be a record for the company. Just want to know, do you think that's a sustainable pace going forward or is '22 just an outsized year?\nJeffrey Stoops: There's 2023, we think it's going to be really good too. And that's kind of as far as the crystal ball goes right now.\nDavid Guarino: Okay.\nJeffrey Stoops: So while we're not making any promises or guaranteeing anything, we don't -- we would not sit here today and tell you that we were sure that 2022 will be the high watermark. It may not be.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. It's definitely encouraging. Maybe going back to the Philippines comment. I don't think you mentioned it, but could you share which M&A would bring their tenant on your new builds? That would be interesting to know just in light of the tower dispositions that several of the carriers have into that recently. And then with the opportunity --\nJeffrey Stoops: It's both globe and smart.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. That's very helpful. Could you just tell us what's the day one yield that you are going to achieve on the tower build, given that large opportunities that you talked about?\nJeffrey Stoops: Double-digit.\nDavid Guarino:  better than what you would get in LatAm or is it comparable to the other emerging markets you're in?\nJeffrey Stoops: It's comparable. And that's on a tower cash flow yield. But that's kind of what we look for when we're putting new towers up.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good evening, Jeff you talked a little bit about the M&A environment. You grew your side portfolio about 8% since last February, how are you thinking about the 5% to 10% long-term guidance? Is that still something you see as achievable even in this M&A environment or my debt more be through M&A or is it more maybe some built-to-suit to hit those sort of numbers?\nJeffrey Stoops: We would definitely go to need some build-to-suit, Simon, to get to any number. But I still feel pretty good about the 5% to 10%. Certainly the 5% and that is still a goal mark. We will need to do a little bit of work around that. like we do every year. But we managed to look a lot and find some things that workforce. We certainly did that between the PG&E deal in Tanzania. We're going to build a lot more towers this year than we built in the prior year. And if we get one good-sized acquisition out there somewhere, we'll hit at least the bottom end of that range.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And on the Philippines, you talked about the large market opportunity. What is critical mass for you in a market like that? Is that 500 towers, a thousand towers? Because is that \nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. Those are good guesses. It's at least 500, so we have gone in there and with the belief and the expectation that we will get to at least 500 towers in that market.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And the final question we have in queue comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Awesome. Maybe two questions for Brendan. Could you share what the backlog of lease applications, what that was up year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Then going back on the $65 million in new leasing in 2022, I would imagine that that is predominantly second-half-weighted. Is it possible that you could exit the year with say, $20 million in new leases on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Brian, I don't want to be too specific on the backlog. It's obviously up a good bit from where it was last year, but we came out of last year with a reasonably good backlog. We had a slow first quarter and then it began to ramp and it's been at a pretty high level that's been fairly consistent throughout at least the second half of the year and as much as back into the second quarter of last year. I don't want to get into the specifics too much.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, if you looked at who was in that backlog in December of 2020, you didn't really have DISH.\nBrendan Cavanagh: We had no DISH. Yes.\nJeffrey Stoops: And you really didn't have Verizon C-band, so it's up big. December 31 to December 31.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, the question is how much of it was sitting there at the time that hadn't yet been signed. If you look at the growth though and the actual number that $65 million that we just printed versus $38, I believe for last year. That percentage from the time that activity was down to when it started to pick up. That's representative of what we saw on the growth in the backlog. So that's almost doubling the backlog in terms of dollars. And then I'm sorry, the second question. I apologize.\nBrandon Nispel: I guess just looking at the new leasing again my numbers, you're at $11 million in new leasing today to get to the guide to $65 million would suggest that you need to get to something like a high teens, low $20 million  for the fourth-quarter and just making sure that that's \nJeffrey Stoops: That's right. Yes. No, that's accurate. I expect that it's going to get -- it's going to go up every single quarter I would expect during the course of this year just based on what we've already signed up and the timing of when we're estimating the commencements. So your numbers are in the right range.\nBrandon Nispel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions in queue.\nJeffrey Stoops: Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us to wrap up our 2021 results, and we greatly look forward to reporting as we move through 2022. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a very strong finish to the year, again, generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. We produced record results in several categories, and we're set up well for a very strong 2022. 2021 lease up activity levels were ahead of plan in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. market was particularly strong with the highest level of organic new leasing revenue per tower signed up in over seven years during the fourth-quarter, T-Mobile remained extremely busy investing in their continued nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. DISH continued signing up a large number of new lease agreements in support of their brand-new nationwide 5G network. Verizon continued its ramp up for their C-band deployments and AT&T remained a steady contributor.  These significant activity levels have also translated into meaningful use services results, where we produced record services, revenue and margin results for the third quarter in a row. Domestic activity has remained strong through the first two months of 2022. And both our leasing and services backlogs have remained very healthy. Not withstanding the solid fourth quarter results we produced in both segments of the business. Based on this backlog commentary from our largest U.S. customers disclosing robust capital expenditure plans for 2022 and the size and scope of our customers 5G deployment plans, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing and services activities throughout 2022 into 2023, and perhaps beyond. Internationally, we had our strongest leasing quarter of the year. Demand remains high in many of our largest international markets, and we expect to continue to see it remains strong throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we signed up 68% of new international revenue through new leases, and 32% through amendments to existing leases. We had strong leasing results in Central America, Brazil, and South Africa.  In addition, the recent 5G spectrum auction in Brazil and the upcoming 5G spectrum auction and South Africa give us confidence that we will continue to see increasing network investment, and thus leasing demand throughout our largest international markets. We're also excited about the potential from our two newest international markets. In early January, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of over 1400 sites from Airtel Tanzania. We believe this market has great promise for us not only in terms of organic lease-up on our acquired sites, but also in terms of new tower build opportunities. Significant wireless investment will be needed over the upcoming years. And we are well-positioned to support our customers in Tanzania, and participate in the growth of wireless throughout this market. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we built our first brand-new greenfield sites in the Philippines. The Philippines is a market that we have studied for a number of years, and we're very excited about the prospects for favorable growth over the next few years. We have established operations in the market, opening a local office, hiring staff, working with the appropriate government agencies for all necessary permits, and establishing strong positive relationships with each of the three major mobile network operators in the market. We are initially and primarily focused on a greenfield new build strategy in the Philippines, and we anticipate the demand to support significant new tower build numbers for the next several years. We believe are significant long-standing tower operation expertise will provide meaningful value to our customers in this market and will give us a competitive advantage. I look forward to sharing results with you in the future as we continue to grow in the Philippines.  Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we believe 2022 will be a very good year. Throughout the last year, we have done an excellent job with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. During the last year, we have completed a number of significant low-cost refinancings which have meaningfully improved our balance sheet positioning, particularly ahead of a period with potentially increasing interest rates. Our early refinancing of several of our outstanding debt securities during 2021 extended out maturity dates and produced the lowest weighted average interest rate in our company's history at 2.6%. The substantial majority of our interest costs has also locked in at fixed rates. We have continued to target our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage in a range of 7 to 7.5 earns, and have invested the available capital produced by that strategy into portfolio growth and share repurchases.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have grown our site portfolio by over 8%, and we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our outstanding stock. We have also been able to continue to meaningfully increase our quarterly dividend. Today, announcing an increase in our dividend of over 22%, while still retaining over 75% of our projected AFFO for additional discretionary investment. We believe that all of these factors will be additive to AFFO per share. And as a result, shareholder value creation. I'd like to take a moment to reflect on full-year results. They were very good. Year-over-year, we grew cash site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO per share by 6.3%, 6.5%, 7.6%, and 13.9% respectively. We posted industry-leading tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins of 81.7% and 70.5%. Beyond the impressive growth rates and margins, the quality of revenue and cash flow shine through backed by predominately U.S. macro towers in our services segment, we had a banner year finishing 2021 with $205 million in revenue and $46 million in gross profit among the highest in company history.  Each quarter throughout the year, SBA posted sequentially higher results are a reflection of the tremendous activity we're seeing from our customers with little signs of slowing. We allocated over $2 billion in 2021 with Alliance Share going towards acquisitions and new builds, share repurchases and dividends. We added 991,335 sites through acquisitions and new builds, respectively in the year, following that, on January 4th, with over 1400 sites acquired in Tanzania. Finally, we published our second corporate sustainability report at the end of the year. Evidencing our continued focus on and success in environmental, social, and governance matters. We take great pride in our performance throughout 2021 and we're very excited about the upcoming year.  The current operating environment for our industry and our internal excellence of operational execution combined to give us great confidence that we will produce very strong results this year. And I believe our full year 2022 outlook provided in today's earnings release supports that confidence. Our customers are all very busy, and we believe we are well-positioned to help them achieve their operational and network goals. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and contributions to our success, and I look forward to sharing our 2022 results with you as we move through the year. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions. Well, we're not going to get too specific, Phil, but we -- there will -- DISH has rolled over quite a bit of activity that will be in our outlook as revenues for 2022. I'll speak generally with AT&T and really just track their public comments, which is that they anticipate a step-up in their level of activity when the 3.45 equipment becomes available midyear, so that they can combine that with C-band equipment and do a one-stop or a one truck roll stop. So if -- I mean, knowing our history and knowing that you really need all your leasing activity in the first nine months of the year to impact that fiscal year's results. I would say you have more probably in there from DISH as opposed to any kind of incremental step-up this fiscal year for AT&T, although we would certainly expect to see that quite a bit greater in 2023. I think it's matching up pretty well with anticipating where leasing revenue is and will be headed for at least the next couple of quarters. So I think it's a current to two quarter forward look at activity. Yeah. In Southeast Asia, there's a number of opportunities, Brett. Carrier dispositions we think will be coming. And just like anywhere else in the world, we will look at that mostly from its financial sensibilities, not that anything strategic as we know necessarily combines North America with the Far East or anywhere in between. So just like with every other decision we make, it will be primarily made on its financial attributes. But having said that, we would love to continue to grow, and that is our goal and remains our number one priority is using capital to grow the portfolio. The second question -- Yeah. I think we're going to -- you're going to continue to see our current pattern of behavior remaining there. We like data centers. But in terms of a big investment, much bigger than kind of what we've been doing it, we'd really have to get to the point where it was absolutely clear that there were great synergies and the data centers would lead to expanded activity at tower site. And while there are certain pieces of evidence to force that, it has not really been proven out yet. So I think it's going to be the latter of the two pass that you framed in your question. And we will continue to learn the business and grow the business very, very modestly. It actually has turned out to be very good so far in the two that we've had. We've had demands for increased capacity. We're actually investing additional capital to grow the capacity in both Jacksonville and Chicago, and that's based on contracted tenant demand. So I mean, so far so good, but not -- it's not material today. It won't be material this year. And we'll see where it goes in the future. Yeah, in terms of visibility, Mike, it hasn't really changed that much in our views around -- and the comments really about this year's activity going into 2023 really are a combination of what our customers have said as to how many sites that they're going to be able to get to this year. What their capital plans are, and what our own internal backlogs are showing. And basically to over simplify it, there's going to be a lot of work still left to do by the end of this year. So that's what gives us confidence about 2023 and not sure it will all be done by the end of 2023. So average growth rates over the next year. I mean, I think on a gross basis, you're still looking at the mid-to-high single. The budgets that we've been, we've been talking about, we feel good about that.  And in terms of leverage, we've talked about this a lot over time. 60 basis point movement in the 10-year, while it seemingly had done quite a bit of impact to our trading multiple. It really doesn't impact the way we think about structure and capital allocation and balance sheet. So we're not really changed anything today based on where the 10-year is now if -- hopefully it doesn't. But if it goes up materially from here, we have to revisit that. The fact that we do pay a dividend puts a little bit more caution and conservatism and where we ultimately want to take leverage or maintain leverage and an increasing rate environment. But the movement that we've seen so far this year really has it caused us to rethink any of the big picture balance sheet structural points. Hey, Rick. There are certain filings that would allow you to monitor it. You have to work at it. But there is a certain reliance on customer transparency, because all the leases really talk only about deploying and using spectrum that is owned or controlled by the lessee. So that's really not -- it's not something that would be allowed under our current leases without some additional discussions and modifications to the lease. But in terms of actually -- it's not like there's necessarily going to be new equipment on the tower to do that. But you would be able to figure that out through RF tests based on each customer's signal strength in that particular area. And if they're not on the tower officially, but for some reason they're broadcasting as a strong signal of 3.45, you know you've got a sharing issue. I mean, one of them is in the late spring and one is in the late fall. Yeah. Our assumptions right now are pretty much the same as what we've disclosed before. When we talked about '22 in last year when we gave our projections for it, we said we'd be somewhere in the $30 or $35 million range. We actually are thinking we're somewhere on the lower end of that right now based on just some slight movements in timing around various decommissionings and stuff. So all that means is that that probably rolls into next year, our projections for '23 and '24 that we've given before are $10 million to $20 million in each year. That's still the case. But obviously if numbers shift in '22 at all, that would slightly affect '23. But really, we have a fairly small level of churn expected for the next couple of years. Before we see our bigger years, which -- -- yes, after this year, which '25 and '26 are the bigger years where we expect to see the majority of our Sprint related churn. Walter, that is more information than I needed to hear. Yeah. And it is having some impact in absolute terms, but we are -- I think we're managing it pretty well. So here's what's going on. So there is wage pressure everywhere. So in the services business, we generally work on fixed fees. In the site consulting business, which is the zoning business. In the construction business, though, which was most of the revenue, and will be this year, that's all bid. And it's bid contemporaneously, so we're able to pass a lot of that on, assuming we win the bid. So we're actually managing it okay. I mean, it has started over a year ago and we're very happy with the profits and the margins that we're producing in that business and our outlook implies that we're going to do it again. So yes, it is happening, but we are managing it in a good way, some of which gets passed on through to the customer because of the bid process than the way the work is awarded. Yes. Yes, it means we the leases -- the leasing activity has been tremendous. The revenue recognition on those leases lags based on either a fixed end day or the earlier of construction. So that's where we managed and estimate that, we were estimating a little bit higher last year. But the reality is the leases are signed up, they rolled over into this year, and it gives us obviously, solid confidence for where DISH's revenue contribution will be this year. Leases that were signed up that had not been done accruing revenue in 2021? Yeah. No, I think we will grow. I think what we have done we will continue to do, which is grow our dividend faster than our AFFO per share growth. Now we have that luxury because we started with a low payout. And on a yield basis, it's still low. But as we've always said, going back to before we paid a dividend, while we want to pay a dividend to expand the base of our Investor universe. We believe that we will make our shareholders more money by keeping the money inside the company and compounding it through portfolio growth and stock repurchases. We have talked about a -- an amount of growth in five-year increments. And I think we've talked about 20% annually. Yes. I was going to answer your question, but. So the Philippines has a 110 million people and growing. And they have about 24,000 cell sites. So there is a huge opportunity based on those numbers to expand wireless networks. And a lot of greenfield sites will need to be built. The market we like it from a stability point of view, from a land use or regulation point of view, there are over 20 tower companies in country. We know that because you have to get a license to operate as a tower company in the Philippines. But we think there's only five or six of them, including us, that are strong and have the confidence of the customers to get meaningful build-to-suit opportunities going forward. We found the customers in the Philippines to be very smart and very careful in terms of who they partner with. And I think those are the kinds of relationships where our history, experience, and our people on the ground will distinguish themselves and we will excel. So I think thousands of towers will be built in the Philippines every year for the next 10 years. And I think if we get our fair share, that will build a nice business there. The numbers are higher. The folks with real capabilities, though, are much lower. Based on $303 stock price in the midpoint of our guidance, that's a 26 times AFFO per share multiple if I'm not mistaken. And that currently -- while I think there is some rationalization going on in the markets, both domestic and internationally. There are a number of transactions that are selling for quite a bit more than that on a multiple basis. So that should lead you to conclude that while we continue to want to grow our portfolio and we'll make every effort to do that. We will do it only in those circumstances where it makes financial sense. And that stock repurchases at today's price relative to private market values are extremely attractive. Yes. The contribution from Tanzania is approximately $22 million to EBITDA, and will be very similar to AFFO. Yes. Well, we will do what we always do, which is take a fine pencil and work through the aspects of our costs where we can do something about it. In some cases, we may be able to improve upon that and in some cases we won't. What is good though in this conversations is people to realize how small, frankly for us compared to other businesses that these changes can really have in our bottom line because of the 70% plus EBITDA margin. We have great operating leverage in this business, and thankfully we've demonstrated over the years and that continues to be true about that a little amount of people can manage and operate a lot of towers. So we have that going for us, but we'll do what we always do, we'll execute and make changes as necessary to make sure we have the best team on the field at the best possible expense levels for the company. It makes things much less complex in terms of the business that you're doing with your counterparty during the life of the MLA. Not sure I got your question. The renegotiation of what? With employees or the renegotiation of an MLA? Well, when we get to that point, that certainly will be a consideration. But I would just say, I think you focused on something that we don't believe will be a material issue at all. And I think if you look at our outlook, you'll see increasing margins. I hope you can tell from our comments, Sami, that we don't really worry about that that much, and we're fully aware of where the market is today and where it might go. It's entirely due to our assessment of return on invested capital for those opportunities versus what we believe we will achieve in Tanzania, Philippines, and markets like that. We've talked a lot, Sami, over the years about how we liked the European market. But when you look at what -- who is competing for assets over there. And the fact that a number of them are -- they denominate their investors and their results in euros, and you can borrow euros, at least you could. I'm not sure what today is, but you could borrow at less than zero. It just became a market that we did not find compelling from an investment perspective and from shareholder value creation perspective. Is it otherwise a good market, sure. There's 2023, we think it's going to be really good too. And that's kind of as far as the crystal ball goes right now. So while we're not making any promises or guaranteeing anything, we don't -- we would not sit here today and tell you that we were sure that 2022 will be the high watermark. It may not be. It's both globe and smart. Double-digit. It's comparable. And that's on a tower cash flow yield. But that's kind of what we look for when we're putting new towers up. We would definitely go to need some build-to-suit, Simon, to get to any number. But I still feel pretty good about the 5% to 10%. Certainly the 5% and that is still a goal mark. We will need to do a little bit of work around that. like we do every year. But we managed to look a lot and find some things that workforce. We certainly did that between the PG&E deal in Tanzania. We're going to build a lot more towers this year than we built in the prior year. And if we get one good-sized acquisition out there somewhere, we'll hit at least the bottom end of that range. Yeah. Those are good guesses. It's at least 500, so we have gone in there and with the belief and the expectation that we will get to at least 500 towers in that market. Well, if you looked at who was in that backlog in December of 2020, you didn't really have DISH. And you really didn't have Verizon C-band, so it's up big. December 31 to December 31. That's right. Yes. No, that's accurate. I expect that it's going to get -- it's going to go up every single quarter I would expect during the course of this year just based on what we've already signed up and the timing of when we're estimating the commencements. So your numbers are in the right range. Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us to wrap up our 2021 results, and we greatly look forward to reporting as we move through 2022. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA finished 2021 with our best quarter of the year. The quarter included financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into 2022. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $539.4 million and cash site leasing revenues were $529.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a headwind, though, on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $2.1 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.7% of churn.  On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.7%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.3% on a gross basis and 3.9% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was at its highest level of the year, this was the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of executions, we continued to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at year-end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 48% of our domestic bookings, with 52% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.  In the fourth quarter, reported domestic site leasing revenue was slightly impacted by the timing of revenue commencements versus our internal estimates, primarily with regard to new DISH leases. This is a timing issue only as the number of leases executed exceeded our expectations. During the quarter, we also had slightly less domestic churn than our internal estimates due to delays in timing versus our prior estimates. Internationally on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.3% net, including 4.4% of churn or 8.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again and was at the highest level of the year. As anticipated, the impact of international churn increased in the quarter as we began to see greater impacts from carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. Although there were some churn timing delays that resulted in slightly lower reported international churn for 2021 than we previously forecasted.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.8% on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter, 84.9% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.3% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 8.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $434.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remained very strong, with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.1% or 91.6%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $409.1 million.  The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.5%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business produced record results for the third quarter in a row with $55.9 million in revenue and $12.9 million of segment operating profit. Notwithstanding these record results, we were able to completely replenish our services backlogs finishing the year at an equal level to our company all-time high backlog from September 30th. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we are projecting another very strong contribution from our services business in 2022, AFFO in the fourth quarter was $310.8 million. AFFO per share was $2.81, an increase of the 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2020 on a constant currency basis.  During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 59 communication sites for total cash consideration of $38.4 million. We also built 88 new sites in the quarter, including our first seven sites built in our new markets the Philippines. Jeff will touch on our expansion into the Philippines in a moment. Subsequent to quarter end on January fourth, we closed on our previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. This transaction added 1445 sites to our tower portfolio at a cash purchase price of a $176.1 million. And the impact of this transaction is fully included in our 2022 full year outlook. Additionally, subsequent to year-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 371 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $137.1 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter.  In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $13.6 million to buy land and easements, and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2022. Our outlook reflects a significant increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments. This increased organic leasing contribution is largely due to the increased pace of new leasing activity we experienced during 2021, as well as some contributions from anticipated continued strong organic leasing activity during 2022.  Our outlook for contributions from new leases and amendments is based in part on estimates of lease commencement timing with each of our customers, and shifts in the timing of equipment installations may have minor impacts on these estimates as they did in the fourth-quarter. We are also projecting increases in contributions from contractual escalations. Most of the increase is projected in our international markets, where inflationary increases are expected to drive increased rental escalations. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2022. The primary increases in connection with anticipated Sprint related decommissioning. Our outlook incorporates a current estimate of approximately $30 million of churn in 2022 related to legacy Sprint leases. And our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remains unchanged. Our total churn projections for 2022 are based in part on internal estimates of a variety of factors that can impact the timing of actual revenue cease dates.  To the extent that there are variances from these internal estimates, there may be impacts on our reported 2022 churn. However, any differences reported 2022 churn from these variances is a tiny issue and does not change our expectations for long-term aggregate churn. In addition to Sprint churn, our outlook includes increased churn in our international markets, primarily due to carrier consolidation in Central America. Our full-year 2022 outlook includes the projected impact of the Tanzania acquisition, but it does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. The outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today.  However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022, however, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and our cost of debt. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $110 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We're very excited about 2022, our customers are all very active and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. And with that, I will now turn things back over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Rick, I mean, they're obviously the majority of our international escalators are in Brazil. Brazil and South Africa being our largest markets. We do have some concentration of leases and a couple of time periods during the year based on acquisitions that we've done over the years and the leaseback associated with those. But otherwise over time, it's fairly well evenly spread in. So we've put in certain basic assumptions for purposes of guidance, obviously, some of those are our best estimate today as to where it will be at the point that the biggest escalator concentration happens. But I think that they are reasonable, if not, maybe a touch conservative. Yeah. We've said, I mean, in the past, we've been pretty clear that we expect to grow it for the next several years by at least 20% per year. And I guess we've done -- And on your second question, I mean, we have always thought of ourselves, first and foremost, as houses and housing antennas, radios. So while there is some movement as to the compute, that's going on at the tower site, we really haven't seen that impacted and it really doesn't impact our thoughts in terms of antenna and radio locations so far lots going on there. We really don't see or expect a material impact, at least in terms of the way we structure leases and think about our business. Brian, I don't want to be too specific on the backlog. It's obviously up a good bit from where it was last year, but we came out of last year with a reasonably good backlog. We had a slow first quarter and then it began to ramp and it's been at a pretty high level that's been fairly consistent throughout at least the second half of the year and as much as back into the second quarter of last year. I don't want to get into the specifics too much. We had no DISH. Yes. Yeah, I mean, the question is how much of it was sitting there at the time that hadn't yet been signed. If you look at the growth though and the actual number that $65 million that we just printed versus $38, I believe for last year. That percentage from the time that activity was down to when it started to pick up. That's representative of what we saw on the growth in the backlog. So that's almost doubling the backlog in terms of dollars. And then I'm sorry, the second question. I apologize."

Later, we will have a question-and-answer session. . As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 1, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had another great quarter with financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into the end of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $535.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $525.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a tailwind though on comparisons to the third quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.2 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% over the third quarter of 2020 including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.3% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was at a similar level to the second quarter, which had represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog continued to grow during the quarter and finished the quarter higher and at a new multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year and into 2022. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 45% of our domestic bookings with 55% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.2% net, including 2.7% of churn or 7.9% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again quarter-over-quarter and was the highest in over a year. Churn grew some in the quarter as well and is anticipated to increase further as we experience the impacts of carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another quarter of increased leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.5% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 84.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.7% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $428.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 90.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $407 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.7%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business produced record results for the second quarter in a row with $53.8 million in revenue and $12.5 million of segment operating profit. Activity levels remained very high in the quarter, and backlogs also continued to grow, finishing the quarter at another all-time high level in our company's history. Based on our strong third quarter and the growing backlog, we have increased our full year 2021 outlook for site development revenue for the third quarter in a row, now expecting $200 million of site development revenue at the midpoint of our outlook range. AFFO in the third quarter was $302.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.71, an increase of 13.9% over the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 144 communication sites for total cash consideration of $57.1 million. We also built 87 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 1,700 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $231 million, including approximately 1,400 sites and approximately $175 million related to the previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of next year, and we anticipate the Airtel Tanzania transaction to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Consistent with our prior outlook, our updated 2021 outlook assumes that the Airtel acquisition closes at the end of the year. And thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these assets. In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the lands under our sect. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend our lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Notwithstanding our assumption of weaker fourth quarter foreign exchange rates, our updated outlook includes increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases result from high services activity levels with our carrier customers, anticipated timing shifts in domestic consolidation churn, reduced cash interest expense as a result of recent refinancings and the impact of recent share repurchases. We anticipate that our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second and third quarters will be supportive of improved incremental organic domestic leasing revenue in 2022, which we will share on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of total debt and $11.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.2x. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.6x, the highest in the company's history. On July 7, the company amended its revolving credit facility. Among other things, the amendment increased the total commitment under the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date of the facility through July 7, 2026, lowered the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the facility and incorporated sustainability link targets into the facility, allowing for interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on how we perform against those targets. As of today, we have no amounts outstanding under our revolver. On October 14, the company repaid at par the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-2C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of April 11, 2023. On October 27, the company through an existing trust issued 895 million of 1.84% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-2C, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 9, 2027, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2051. And $895 million of 2.593% secured tower revenue securities Series 2021-3C, which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9, 2031, and a final maturity date of October 10, 2056. The aggregate $1.79 billion of these Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.217% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 7.8 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and remaining proceeds will be used to redeem the entire aggregate $1.1 billion principal amount of the 2016 4.875% senior notes and to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption. Pro forma for these financing activities, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt drops to 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 5 years. And the interest rate on 97% of our outstanding debt is fixed.  During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of our common stock for $150 million at an average price per share of $340.70. Subsequent to September 13, we repurchased an additional 601,000 shares for $200 million at an average price per share of $332.72. Combined, the average purchase price for the $350 million of repurchases was $336.09 per share. All the shares we purchased were retired. After these repurchases, we had $125 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our subsequently replaced $1 billion stock repurchase plan. On October 28, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase plan replacing the prior plan. The new plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the company's Board of Directors at any time in its sole discretion. As of today, the company has the full $1 billion of authorization remaining under the new plan. The company shares outstanding at September 30, 2021, were 109.5 million, compared to 111.4 million at September 30, 2020, a reduction of 1.8%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.6 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.58 per share payable on December 16, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2021. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 21% of third quarter AFFO per share, which leaves us ample room for material future dividend growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had another very good quarter in the third quarter, exceeding our own expectations. As you've heard, we continue to see very high levels of carrier activity in our U.S. business. Each of our major customers was busy in the quarter. Verizon beginning their C-band deployments; T-Mobile continuing their ubiquitous deployment of their 600 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum; DISH continuing their torrid pace from the second quarter, signing up new agreements to facilitate the build-out of their brand-new nationwide 5G network; and AT&T remaining steady. Notwithstanding the high levels of new leasing revenue that we signed up during the third quarter, we still finished the quarter adding new multiyear high backlog of pending leases and amendment applications. Based on this backlog and conversations with our customers, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing activities through the balance of this year and well into 2022. In addition to high domestic leasing activity levels, we produced record services revenue in the third quarter, surpassing our second quarter record. Our customers are all focused on building out their 5G networks, particularly targeting upgrades to their macro networks. Similar to our domestic leasing backlogs, our services backlog continued to grow during the quarter and reached a new all-time time for the company at quarter end. The strong third quarter performance and growing backlogs have allowed us to increase our full year outlook for all revenue-related line items. Internationally, we began to see our markets starting to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. We again produced quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and ended up with solid leasing results in the third quarter that were ahead of plan. During the quarter, we signed up 55% of new international revenue through new leases and 45% through amendments to existing leases. Our largest contributors to our leasing results came from Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest international markets. As our international markets continue to recover from the pandemic, and upcoming spectrum auctions across a number of our markets are planned, including Brazil, which will put more spectrum into the hands of our customers, we expect to continue to see growth in the level of network investment made by our carrier customers over the next several years. We executed very well for our customers in the quarter, and we are committed to continue to do so during these future expected periods of increased demand. In addition to our strong third quarter operating results, we continue to improve our positioning with regard to our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility, extended the term and improved the pricing. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a new $1.79 billion securitization financing, refinancing some existing securitization debt and using the remaining proceeds to shortly repay our $1.1 billion of 4.875% 2024 unsecured notes. The weighted average interest rate of these new securities is 2.2% and the weighted average term is 7.8 years. The net result of these financing activities will be annual cash interest savings of approximately $35 million. This financing was a particularly positive outcome for SBA as we also achieved the highest debt capacity in our long history of ABS financing. As Mark mentioned earlier, our pro forma weighted average interest rate across all of our debt dropped to 2.6%, our lowest ever, and we ended the quarter at 7.2x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA well in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 terms. Our ability to continue to drive our liquidity position higher, lower our cost of debt and extend out our maturity dates, gives us great flexibility in operating the business and allocating capital into additional investments for the benefit of our shareholders. The combination of low-cost debt and our expectations around future AFFO per share growth should make stock repurchases at the levels we have been buying very accretive to future AFFO per share. During the quarter, we continued to add to our portfolio through both building and acquiring new sites. We also signed up agreements to purchase additional sites and anticipate closing on the majority of our Tanzania transaction by year-end. In addition to portfolio growth, we continue to opportunistically buy back stock, repurchasing over 1 million shares since our last earnings call, and our announced fourth quarter dividend represents an increase of 25% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. We feel very good about our current capital structure and ability to allocate capital to generate incremental value for our shareholders. We're in a very good time for the industry and for SBA specifically. Our customers are very busy. Our financial position is very strong and the future continues to hold many opportunities for us. We're excited about pursuing those opportunities, and I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success. I look forward to sharing our year-end results with you next quarter. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRichard Prentiss: A couple of questions. Obviously, you guys are pretty excited with the backlog, services business, leasing business. If I look specifically at the implied change to new lease amendment activity in the fourth quarter in the U.S., it looks like a pretty nice step up. How should we think about -- I know you're not giving guidance yet, but how should we think about how that plays into '22 as far as does it build throughout '22? Is it fairly level loaded, now that we're sitting here in November, you probably have some pretty good visibility to what the pacing of '22 looks like, not the actual number?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I mean, given the fact that we report those things on a trailing 12 basis and knowing what we had in the fourth quarter a year ago and first quarter of this year, I think it's going to build, Ric, as we -- at least as we move into the middle of next year. And then we'll see what happens with lease-up then because that will start to have some year-over-year comps that we're going to be working off some pretty good numbers for the back half of this year.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And then on the escalator side, is there anything that varies the escalators quarter-to-quarter that causes any swings on the way you guys have your contracts set up. We've seen some bouncing around some of the other tower guys in the U.S., specifically where you have more fixed.\nJeffrey Stoops: Not in the U.S.\nRichard Prentiss: Fairly consistent, obviously, maybe 3%, 3.3%, sound pretty consistent.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. Again, in the U.S., I mean, a lot of our international stuff is CPI-based.\nRichard Prentiss: Last one for me. Can you update us on Sprint churn, what kind of magnitude you're looking at? Have you gotten any indication yet from T-Mobile? Is it mostly going to just be the co-located sites? Is it going to be nearby side? So just kind of maybe frame for us size and timing and kind of how you're having those discussions with T-Mobile and Sprint?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Ric, it's Brendan. So first of all, you may have noticed in our bridge that we made an adjustment to actually reduce our domestic churn impact for '21. That's basically all due to Sprint. It's a timing issue, though. It's taking them perhaps a little bit longer than we were anticipating because we're making some estimates, obviously, around that heading into it. That doesn't change our view on the total potential exposure for churn, but it shifts the timing back to slightly. So I would expect that to kind of move to next year. In terms of what we expect today, we've given some ranges in the past, and I'll kind of reiterate that. They move a little bit, obviously, as we learn more about it. But this year, in '21, we would expect the total impact to end up being somewhere around $7 million. Next year is a higher year for us based on the timing of when leases hit the end of their terms. We expect it to be probably at the higher end of our previously stated range of $30 million to $35 million. I'd say it's closer to $35 million, mostly because of the shift in timing I just mentioned. And then in 2023 and 2024, we would estimate somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range for impact in each of those years. And our biggest years of exposure are 2025 and '26 where the range would be somewhere in that $45 million-ish range, $40 million to $50 million, say, to put brackets around it for each of those years. And then some de minimis amount after that. In terms of where it's coming from, a lot of it is on overlap sites, but some of it is certainly on sites that are proximity sites. And then in some cases, it's not always totally clear to us. I think they're still working through that. We don't have total vision on what they're doing with other neighboring sites. But I would say it's a mix of the two. But obviously, the greatest focus as it relates to our portfolio will be the sites where they have direct overlap.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: So you talked about the strong leasing end that DISH had this torrid pace. Can you help us understand how the bookings to billings will go? And are we seeing much of DISH in the fourth quarter guide or then you revised full year guide? Or is that really going to flow through more in 2022? And then you talked about the benefits of recent spectrum auctions or ongoing spectrum auctions, I guess, here and in Brazil and elsewhere, maybe on the 3.45 specifically in the U.S. Do you think that's going to create much incremental leasing? Or do you think a lot of that can be encompassed by the carriers in their C-band deployments? And any sense of when you might start to see that 3.45 get deployed? Could it pull forward some of that second phase of C-band builds to put up this spectrum?\nJeffrey Stoops: Our understanding, Simon, on your last question is that the 3.45 will require new radios. So there will be some incremental activity there that the industry should benefit from. What was your first question?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It's timing.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. So I think we've explained this before. But we have a master deal with DISH, and there's commitments and a lot of benefits going back and forth between each parties. I mean one of the things, Simon, that was in there is DISH has a payments schedule such that after signing, they have until a date certain for installation of their equipment on that site before we begin to start collecting revenue. So the vast, vast, vast notwithstanding the tremendous amount of lease-ups that we've had, the vast majority of all that recognition doesn't start until 2022. So the answer as to is there much, if anything, ambition in the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the activity, the answer is no. I think you had a third question. Did I miss the...\nSimon Flannery: It was on the 3.45, any sense on the timing of when that you might start to see that deployment relative to the C-band?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, I mean, my understanding is decisions get made. Final auction results are known and decisions get made in the first quarter of next year. I do not believe there's the same clearing requirements that you have with the C-band. So I don't see any reason why we wouldn't start to see some activity in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC.\nJonathan Atkin: Yes. So I had a question about international exposure and basically EMEA and maybe tackle Europe and Africa separately, thoughts on how those regions might be appealing to you going forward? And then domestically, wanted to find out about the timing of revenue. You talked about DISH, but more generally, as you think about the availability of workforce and people to actually construct sites. What's your thinking with respect to any pressures that the industry might see in 2022 that might affect leasing revenue recognition as opposed to just bookings?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the globe, Jonathan, I mean we look all over and we look to find areas that fit our criteria. And we found a lot of that, obviously, in the Western Hemisphere, some of that in Africa. And I believe we will continue to find those opportunities as we go forward on a country-by-country basis. Africa has a lot of growth, certainly has some risk. But if you get into the right price and you operate well as we believe we do, you will do well. Europe is a fine market. We just have not found opportunities that are at prices that we think makes sense for us given our other opportunities to deploy capital. But we keep looking. I mean, we look at everything. That's what people expect us to do. In terms of the labor market, we watch that carefully because obviously, a lot of other industries are suffering right now. We are not. We have a large internal workforce in cruise. We also use outsourced crews for some of the work. And right now, it's all working out okay. There's a number of training resources and opportunities that we think will increase the available workforce over the next several years. So I think generally, we feel okay, but I mean, that really is a quarter-by-quarter question that you asked. So the best I can tell you today is this quarter, next quarter, we feel okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk: Jeff, can you -- to the extent you can provide us a little bit more color about the Sprint like the churn delay, I guess. I mean is there any indication that as they go through the portfolio, they're recognizing that maybe they're not going to turn off as many sites as originally. I know you talked about the next 2 years, and they were generally all in the same ballpark. But qualitatively, is there -- are they still, I think, targeting overall the same amount, maybe more, maybe less? Any thoughts on that?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Walt, this is Brendan. Yes, it seems like thus far, from what we've seen in our communications with them that it's generally still targeting the same thing that we thought originally more or less. I think the shift here is really just the timing on moving off of some of the sites. You may have even seen they talked about some delay in shutting down the CDMA network. I think that probably is a factor in it. So I don't think that the overall focus is shifting at all, but the timing might be slightly different. That's all.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. And then on the inorganic stuff, this year was a pretty big year although it seems like with the guidance, Q4 is whatever, you're still obviously up versus last year. But when you think about '22 in terms of new sites, M&A, that type of stuff, any sense on kind of what that market will look like for you?\nJeffrey Stoops: I think it will continue to look challenging from an acquisition perspective really based on price wall. Prices continue to remain high, and in our opinion, without much differentiation for quality, which is where we end up being very selective and picking our spots carefully. I do think there's enough out there for us to certainly hit the low end of our historical targeted range of 5% portfolio growth. I imagine with Tanzania and some increased activity that we expected some of our existing markets that we will build more towers next year as well. So all in all, that will be -- the 5% to 10% portfolio growth will be the goal again next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on the international side, you mentioned that churn should remain elevated for some time. Can you provide more color on that? And capital allocation priorities, can you help us think about maybe discretionary CapEx, excluding M&A, does that stay elevated as you ramp maybe augmentation CapEx to support higher growth? Yes. That's it.\nBrendan Cavanagh: So on the international churn, we've been -- as you probably seen and we talked about, I think, on previous calls that we expected some elevated international churn this year. We haven't experienced most of that yet through the year. But in the fourth quarter, we expect to see that jump. Largely due -- the primary reason is due to consolidation-related churn, particularly with Claro and Telef\u00f3nica combining in Guatemala, a lot of the impacts of that are starting to be felt here in the fourth quarter, which is what's going to drive the full year number that we provided. And obviously, with it being so late in the year, it has an impact on what we would expect to report not just in the fourth quarter but in the next -- into next year. In addition, there are -- we are dealing with a number of our customers in Central America. We have some that are working through network changes due to various issues that they face. And others where the terms of the agreements are starting to come to an end, and we're working through what their future plans might look like. So we expect there might be some incremental churn associated with that, but we also would expect longer-term commitments and other business commitments as well as part of that. So it really was an indication mostly though, about the consolidation churn that we're going to experience in Q4.\nJeffrey Stoops: So Batya, on your other question about discretionary CapEx, the way you asked that question, you implied that our non-M&A discretionary CapEx was going up. I don't really think it is in terms of augmentations per tower. We don't really see anything material there. And keep in mind, there's a historical practice, which continues that our customers tend to pay most, if not all, of those augmentation dollars. Would there be something else besides the tower side, Brendan, in the discretionary CapEx?\nBrendan Cavanagh: There's been some CapEx spent on the data centers that we acquired. So that might be the incremental piece that we obviously hadn't had in the past.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. And that -- just to be clear, that's in response to demand for increased megawattage and capacity at these data centers. So that is CapEx that we're extremely pleased to be able to invest.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson.\nNicholas Del Deo: The first, if my math is right, it looks like your implied site leasing revenue and tower cash flow guidance for Q4 are about equal to what you generated in Q3, at least at the midpoint. But was there anything that helped Q3 results that won't carry through into Q4, like back billings or anything similar?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, FX.\nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. All right. Simple enough. And then I guess in terms of U.S. activity, are you seeing the incumbents deploy their mid-band spectrum and DISH with its de novo build? You're kind of engaging with you even -- relatively evenly across your portfolio. Or is there a noticeable skew towards more urban or the denser suburban markets that you serve?\nJeffrey Stoops: I don't think it's noticeably skewed. I think we're seeing activity pretty much everywhere.\nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. If I can squeeze in one last one. If I look at other revenue for international, that was up by about $6 million versus your prior guidance. Is that mostly fuel, pass-through fuel or is something else going on there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No, it is mostly pass-through expenses. It's actually -- a lot of it is actually related to ground leases, in particular, in Brazil, where we pass those through to the carriers. And that -- part of that is CPI that we didn't -- while we projected CPI increases across our tenant leases, we didn't necessarily include that on the ground leases because it's a pass-through. But as that's starting to come along with the increased inflation down there, it's pushing ground rents higher, which obviously pushes the pass-through rents higher as well, plus there is some power costs, as you mentioned as well. That's the main driver.\nOperator: Next, we're going to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: I wanted to follow up. You said, I think, in the prepared remarks that you assume that AT&T is steady from here. Do you think AT&T is at a full run rate? Or are you just assuming that they haven't ramped up by the fourth quarter guidance period?\nJeffrey Stoops: No. I think to be clear, Phil, we said that they were steady relative to kind of last quarter. I believe that they will ramp up in the times to come.\nPhil Cusick: Okay. And is the conversation is building toward that already?\nJeffrey Stoops: Let me -- I'll just leave it the way I said it. I believe that their activity levels will ramp as we move into next year.\nPhil Cusick: That's more than I expected. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: I don't know I can follow up on that belly laugh, Jeff. So I guess I had 2 questions. One was in the prepared remarks, Brendan, you called out the Big 4, which we haven't heard in a while, and maybe wonder if the magnitude to which DISH is spending is roughly on par with what the actual Big 3 are spending in terms of your business. And then the second question I had was you also referenced some spectrum auctions that are happening in the coming months in not just domestically, but international markets. Specifically, I'm interested in South Africa. That's been a problem market from a spectrum perspective, a little messy over the last little while. I was wondering if you could kind of give us some picture as to what you thought the outlook would be for South African spectrum auctions in 2022?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. And I mean when you really parse out our comments, David, and you look at the domestic split between leasing and amendments, and you think about historically how networks get upgraded mostly through amendments. So where are all those new leases coming from? Well, they're mostly coming from DISH. So yes, for this quarter and last quarter, they're right up there in terms of quarterly contributions with the other Big 3. So that's why we said what we said. In terms of South Africa, those spectrum auctions have been pushed back a little bit. There's a lot of interplay between the wireless carriers and the government. The best that we can tell is that the auctions will be not this year, but in 2022, now are scheduled for the first half but they will be the full suite of 5G spectrum. I think it's 600 or 700 rather, 2.5 and 3.5. So you're going to have all the tools necessary for the carriers in that country to pick up what they need to move into 5G. So obviously, we're excited about that. It will mean similar to what it means in the U.S. when customers move from 4G to 5G.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. That was exactly what I thought you would say, Jeff. So, just exactly. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Since you seem to be in such a generous mood to share some new information, I'll take a crack at this. So you mentioned multiyear highs for services and leasing backlog. And I was thinking back to your 10-Ks where in '19, you had a leasing backlog of about $22 million; in 2018, you had about $16 million. And on the services side, it was about over those 2 years, $55 million and $76 million. Can you share some context on how the current backlog compares to these couple of years? And then just secondly, curious if you could delve further into what you're learning from your data centers and how you're thinking about the edge and the role SBA is going to play in that in the future?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. The 10-K disclosures, Mike, are -- it's apples and oranges to what we were talking about in our earnings script and the press release. That disclosure is signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue. And when we talk about backlog, it\u2019s applications. So those 2 things really are not correlating. But I'll give you a little more color on the backlogs. It's not multiyear high for services, it's all-time high ever. For leasing, it is a multiyear high, going back probably to the heady 4G days. But it's good. And it took a big jump up in the quarter, notwithstanding a very high degree of signings. So that's why we say what we said and why we feel good about next year. What was your second question?\nMichael Rollins: What you're learning from the data centers and the edge?\nJeffrey Stoops: What we're learning is that -- it's generally a good business, data centers in general, not that anybody needs me to tell them that. But one that we like and we see synergies with the micro edge facilities where we have now -- we've got 4 or 5 of these things more being built. And in many cases, the sale was made because we were able to provide data center space in addition to the micro edge space. So there's a big demand for redundancy, for disaster recovery, for backup. So the hub-and-spoke model that we talked about earlier as to where we think this makes the most sense from our perspective is playing out, albeit a little bit slowly because I'm not sure the edge has really quite moved yet to the tower site, but it is headed in that direction.\nMichael Rollins: And so where do you think this goes over time? Are towers partners to data centers are towers owners of a lot more data centers? Where does this evolve into?\nJeffrey Stoops: It could evolve in either of those directions. But it does evolve into a more converged universe. And I think ultimately, the degree of that convergence, Mike, will be how much computing power is truly needed right at the cell site. And I don't think we know yet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: I guess I'll have a follow-up on that one. I mean, we know your historical views on investing in fiber in the U.S. But if you were to start to see real synergy between the connectivity, between your data center assets and the edge facilities you can offer at sites. Would you maybe reconsider deploying the fiber between those locations? And then just a second question. I would imagine the big uptick in the backlog is from what we're going to start calling the Big 4 again. But I'm curious whether you're seeing anything in there from nontraditional tenants, maybe enterprises looking to deploy CBRS-based systems using your infrastructure? And if it's not in the backlog, is there anything going on from a conversation standpoint to suggest that could be percolating?\nJeffrey Stoops: On your first question, it could make sense where we control both ends of the destination to have fiber running between that we actually own. We do think, over time, Brett, that a full suite of product offerings and solutions to the customer will be good. I mean it's hard to sell someone -- it's not as easy rather, to sell someone micro edge space when at the same time you said, well, you've got to go funding a fiber. So we'll see and never say never. But we -- I don't think the way fiber has been traditionally bought, developed and deployed -- that's a business I don't know that we would enter. It's going to be more when it joins 2 ends of things that we control.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And then in terms of the nontraditional tenants in the backlog, there are some certainly, Brett, but as a percentage of the total backlog it's pretty small, partially because the big carriers are so active right now that we have huge backlogs with them. And so it's pretty immaterial in terms of its overall impact.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. But there's some in there, but it in the lion's share is clearly from Big 4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael: Great. One quick follow-up and then another one. As it relates to the international churn you've highlighted you expect it to be elevated in the fourth quarter. Is that just a 1 quarter thing? Or would you anticipate churn being elevated in 2022 versus what we\u2019ll ultimately see in 2021? And then secondly, in the press release, you guys mentioned, I think this was quoted to Jeff. We expect elevated domestic leasing activities to continue through 2022 and perhaps beyond. I was wondering if you could just expand on that. Is that really just tied to some of the comments you've already made as it relates to DISH? Or is there really more than that? And maybe even how does AT&T in particular factor into that?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Jeff, I'll start on the international churn side. I do expect it to be elevated not only in the fourth quarter but into next year, in part because the fourth quarter -- especially when we report our same-tower churn numbers, it's obviously on a trailing 12 months basis. So what happens in Q4 will be carried with us throughout the balance of the year. So next year will certainly be higher in terms of its full year impact than this year because of the concentration late in the year.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. And on the length of the activity, Colby, comments really reflect just the historical norms of the life cycle of the G upgrade going from 1G to the next. Mean when you think about where Verizon is and where AT&T is on C-band, the 3.45 stuff that's not even out yet, and where DISH is, I mean it's pretty easy to see that activity is going to move into 2023.\nColby Synesael: Do you think then that we could actually be in a situation where we just continue to see that acceleration? I mean I think one of the big debates that investors are having now is, do we start to flat line in '22? Or is there an opportunity for another step-up?\nJeffrey Stoops: I mean at some point, that has to flat line. I don't know I don't know specifically how to answer that question for next year until we see more about the 3.45 auction and understand some more of the timing. But I think flat line or not, I understand the importance of that from an investor perspective. But I mean we see years of elevated activity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Just curious on Brazil, if you could maybe provide us some color, you mentioned that same tower growth stepped up there in the quarter, and there's a spectrum auction coming up later this week. Do you think that could drive another wave of amendment activity across the Brazilian market?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. I clearly do because the spectrum that they're being -- that's being put forth is what's really necessary for the carriers to offer a 5G solution, which they have not yet really embarked up. So much like what's going on here in the U.S. when that spectrum is auctioned and put into use, you're going to have similar activity levels. In terms of the -- you want to speak, Brendan to the increase lease-up?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, so the growth rate stepped up, it's really a combination of 2 things. One is the escalators are higher because of the CPI-based increases. And as inflation has increased in Brazil, that's caused our escalators to be increasing. And then we have in addition, seeing increased actual leasing activity over the last 2 quarters where it's sequentially increased over what it had been at the beginning of the year. I think really, as we come out of some of the more serious COVID-related periods in Brazil, we're starting to see the carriers moving back more towards traditional spending levels. And so that's encouraging as well.\nEric Luebchow: And just one follow-up for me. You mentioned building more towers next year. Just could you remind us which markets you're seeing build-to-suit opportunities and then perhaps like what you're kind of underwriting today for return or yield requirements for building new sites in terms of NOI or development yield?\nJeffrey Stoops: We will build sites next year in every market in which we are currently active. So -- and in most of those markets, more sites than we build today. And we're looking at generally 10%-ish tower cash flow yield on day 1.\nEric Luebchow: Got it. So that includes the U.S. where newbuilds have been fairly slow the last few years?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. That does.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino: I was wondering if you could provide any updates on Oi. And specifically, I was wondering if you have any updates on the land underlying I think it was around 2,000 sites in Brazil that are up for renewal in \u201825, feel like there's a lot of moving pieces. So just trying to understand if there's any risk of loss revenue from those sites?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. There's -- now you're talking about the concession sites, I think, from the acquisition that we did. Yes. No, there's really not, and we expect that we'll -- those will actually be continued on. And actually, those leases extend out, I believe, longer than that with us as a commitment from Hawaii that goes out beyond the...\nJeffrey Stoops: Two-thirds to 2035, I believe.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. That transaction is supposed -- now the latest thinking is that, that doesn't get consummated until sometime next year. And then with the network rationalization aspects that come out of that not starting until sometime in 2023.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. Maybe switching gears then, going back to an earlier question about you guys talking about DISH as part of the Big 4 carriers. Does that mean that you're going to update your customer concentration table to reflect DISH once the revenue starts commencing on the tower sites?\nJeffrey Stoops: Sure. Yes, of course.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, once they reach a level, I mean that -- we're giving the concentrations above 10% of revenue. Obviously, they'd have to achieve that. Their contributions to leasing activity are significant and on par with the other carriers now. But obviously, the total sum of revenue, considering they're starting at zero, is at a much lower percentage. So we ultimately will do that if they achieve that level of contribution.\nOperator: And our final question in queue at this time comes from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Two questions. One, could you comment just on leasing PG&E assets. Any additional comments you could provide there? I don't think anybody asked. And then on the balance sheet, I think you guys called out blended interest costs of 2.25% or so and then some incremental run rate savings. Could you -- what else is to be done there going forward? Do you guys see interest expense coming down?\nJeffrey Stoops: PG&E is ahead of plan, benefiting from all of the U.S. activity from all the contributors that we earlier discussed in general. So we're extremely pleased with that. And...\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the balance sheet, the -- just to correct what you said, the average interest rate is now on a pro forma basis, 2.6%. There are potentially some other possibilities. We obviously have maturity dates that come up over the next several years. Really, we'll have to see where interest rates are as we hit those dates. There's probably some opportunity to refinance and have some additional improvement, but I think we've done the vast majority of that now with the last deal that we just completed this past month.\nJeffrey Stoops: Ryan, is that it? Or is there another question?\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue.\nJeffrey Stoops: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening, and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter sometime in February. Have a great day.\nOperator: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. I'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had another very good quarter in the third quarter, exceeding our own expectations. As you've heard, we continue to see very high levels of carrier activity in our U.S. business. Each of our major customers was busy in the quarter. Verizon beginning their C-band deployments; T-Mobile continuing their ubiquitous deployment of their 600 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz spectrum; DISH continuing their torrid pace from the second quarter, signing up new agreements to facilitate the build-out of their brand-new nationwide 5G network; and AT&T remaining steady. Notwithstanding the high levels of new leasing revenue that we signed up during the third quarter, we still finished the quarter adding new multiyear high backlog of pending leases and amendment applications. Based on this backlog and conversations with our customers, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing activities through the balance of this year and well into 2022. In addition to high domestic leasing activity levels, we produced record services revenue in the third quarter, surpassing our second quarter record. Our customers are all focused on building out their 5G networks, particularly targeting upgrades to their macro networks. Similar to our domestic leasing backlogs, our services backlog continued to grow during the quarter and reached a new all-time time for the company at quarter end. The strong third quarter performance and growing backlogs have allowed us to increase our full year outlook for all revenue-related line items. Internationally, we began to see our markets starting to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. We again produced quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and ended up with solid leasing results in the third quarter that were ahead of plan. During the quarter, we signed up 55% of new international revenue through new leases and 45% through amendments to existing leases. Our largest contributors to our leasing results came from Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest international markets. As our international markets continue to recover from the pandemic, and upcoming spectrum auctions across a number of our markets are planned, including Brazil, which will put more spectrum into the hands of our customers, we expect to continue to see growth in the level of network investment made by our carrier customers over the next several years. We executed very well for our customers in the quarter, and we are committed to continue to do so during these future expected periods of increased demand. In addition to our strong third quarter operating results, we continue to improve our positioning with regard to our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility, extended the term and improved the pricing. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a new $1.79 billion securitization financing, refinancing some existing securitization debt and using the remaining proceeds to shortly repay our $1.1 billion of 4.875% 2024 unsecured notes. The weighted average interest rate of these new securities is 2.2% and the weighted average term is 7.8 years. The net result of these financing activities will be annual cash interest savings of approximately $35 million. This financing was a particularly positive outcome for SBA as we also achieved the highest debt capacity in our long history of ABS financing. As Mark mentioned earlier, our pro forma weighted average interest rate across all of our debt dropped to 2.6%, our lowest ever, and we ended the quarter at 7.2x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA well in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 terms. Our ability to continue to drive our liquidity position higher, lower our cost of debt and extend out our maturity dates, gives us great flexibility in operating the business and allocating capital into additional investments for the benefit of our shareholders. The combination of low-cost debt and our expectations around future AFFO per share growth should make stock repurchases at the levels we have been buying very accretive to future AFFO per share. During the quarter, we continued to add to our portfolio through both building and acquiring new sites. We also signed up agreements to purchase additional sites and anticipate closing on the majority of our Tanzania transaction by year-end. In addition to portfolio growth, we continue to opportunistically buy back stock, repurchasing over 1 million shares since our last earnings call, and our announced fourth quarter dividend represents an increase of 25% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of last year. We feel very good about our current capital structure and ability to allocate capital to generate incremental value for our shareholders. We're in a very good time for the industry and for SBA specifically. Our customers are very busy. Our financial position is very strong and the future continues to hold many opportunities for us. We're excited about pursuing those opportunities, and I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success. I look forward to sharing our year-end results with you next quarter. And with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions. Well, I mean, given the fact that we report those things on a trailing 12 basis and knowing what we had in the fourth quarter a year ago and first quarter of this year, I think it's going to build, Ric, as we -- at least as we move into the middle of next year. And then we'll see what happens with lease-up then because that will start to have some year-over-year comps that we're going to be working off some pretty good numbers for the back half of this year. Not in the U.S. Yes. Again, in the U.S., I mean, a lot of our international stuff is CPI-based. Our understanding, Simon, on your last question is that the 3.45 will require new radios. So there will be some incremental activity there that the industry should benefit from. What was your first question? Yes. So I think we've explained this before. But we have a master deal with DISH, and there's commitments and a lot of benefits going back and forth between each parties. I mean one of the things, Simon, that was in there is DISH has a payments schedule such that after signing, they have until a date certain for installation of their equipment on that site before we begin to start collecting revenue. So the vast, vast, vast notwithstanding the tremendous amount of lease-ups that we've had, the vast majority of all that recognition doesn't start until 2022. So the answer as to is there much, if anything, ambition in the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the activity, the answer is no. I think you had a third question. Did I miss the... Well, I mean, my understanding is decisions get made. Final auction results are known and decisions get made in the first quarter of next year. I do not believe there's the same clearing requirements that you have with the C-band. So I don't see any reason why we wouldn't start to see some activity in the second half. Yes. In terms of the globe, Jonathan, I mean we look all over and we look to find areas that fit our criteria. And we found a lot of that, obviously, in the Western Hemisphere, some of that in Africa. And I believe we will continue to find those opportunities as we go forward on a country-by-country basis. Africa has a lot of growth, certainly has some risk. But if you get into the right price and you operate well as we believe we do, you will do well. Europe is a fine market. We just have not found opportunities that are at prices that we think makes sense for us given our other opportunities to deploy capital. But we keep looking. I mean, we look at everything. That's what people expect us to do. In terms of the labor market, we watch that carefully because obviously, a lot of other industries are suffering right now. We are not. We have a large internal workforce in cruise. We also use outsourced crews for some of the work. And right now, it's all working out okay. There's a number of training resources and opportunities that we think will increase the available workforce over the next several years. So I think generally, we feel okay, but I mean, that really is a quarter-by-quarter question that you asked. So the best I can tell you today is this quarter, next quarter, we feel okay. I think it will continue to look challenging from an acquisition perspective really based on price wall. Prices continue to remain high, and in our opinion, without much differentiation for quality, which is where we end up being very selective and picking our spots carefully. I do think there's enough out there for us to certainly hit the low end of our historical targeted range of 5% portfolio growth. I imagine with Tanzania and some increased activity that we expected some of our existing markets that we will build more towers next year as well. So all in all, that will be -- the 5% to 10% portfolio growth will be the goal again next year. So Batya, on your other question about discretionary CapEx, the way you asked that question, you implied that our non-M&A discretionary CapEx was going up. I don't really think it is in terms of augmentations per tower. We don't really see anything material there. And keep in mind, there's a historical practice, which continues that our customers tend to pay most, if not all, of those augmentation dollars. Would there be something else besides the tower side, Brendan, in the discretionary CapEx? Yes. And that -- just to be clear, that's in response to demand for increased megawattage and capacity at these data centers. So that is CapEx that we're extremely pleased to be able to invest. I don't think it's noticeably skewed. I think we're seeing activity pretty much everywhere. No. I think to be clear, Phil, we said that they were steady relative to kind of last quarter. I believe that they will ramp up in the times to come. Let me -- I'll just leave it the way I said it. I believe that their activity levels will ramp as we move into next year. Yes. And I mean when you really parse out our comments, David, and you look at the domestic split between leasing and amendments, and you think about historically how networks get upgraded mostly through amendments. So where are all those new leases coming from? Well, they're mostly coming from DISH. So yes, for this quarter and last quarter, they're right up there in terms of quarterly contributions with the other Big 3. So that's why we said what we said. In terms of South Africa, those spectrum auctions have been pushed back a little bit. There's a lot of interplay between the wireless carriers and the government. The best that we can tell is that the auctions will be not this year, but in 2022, now are scheduled for the first half but they will be the full suite of 5G spectrum. I think it's 600 or 700 rather, 2.5 and 3.5. So you're going to have all the tools necessary for the carriers in that country to pick up what they need to move into 5G. So obviously, we're excited about that. It will mean similar to what it means in the U.S. when customers move from 4G to 5G. Yes. The 10-K disclosures, Mike, are -- it's apples and oranges to what we were talking about in our earnings script and the press release. That disclosure is signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue. And when we talk about backlog, it's applications. So those 2 things really are not correlating. But I'll give you a little more color on the backlogs. It's not multiyear high for services, it's all-time high ever. For leasing, it is a multiyear high, going back probably to the heady 4G days. But it's good. And it took a big jump up in the quarter, notwithstanding a very high degree of signings. So that's why we say what we said and why we feel good about next year. What was your second question? What we're learning is that -- it's generally a good business, data centers in general, not that anybody needs me to tell them that. But one that we like and we see synergies with the micro edge facilities where we have now -- we've got 4 or 5 of these things more being built. And in many cases, the sale was made because we were able to provide data center space in addition to the micro edge space. So there's a big demand for redundancy, for disaster recovery, for backup. So the hub-and-spoke model that we talked about earlier as to where we think this makes the most sense from our perspective is playing out, albeit a little bit slowly because I'm not sure the edge has really quite moved yet to the tower site, but it is headed in that direction. It could evolve in either of those directions. But it does evolve into a more converged universe. And I think ultimately, the degree of that convergence, Mike, will be how much computing power is truly needed right at the cell site. And I don't think we know yet. On your first question, it could make sense where we control both ends of the destination to have fiber running between that we actually own. We do think, over time, Brett, that a full suite of product offerings and solutions to the customer will be good. I mean it's hard to sell someone -- it's not as easy rather, to sell someone micro edge space when at the same time you said, well, you've got to go funding a fiber. So we'll see and never say never. But we -- I don't think the way fiber has been traditionally bought, developed and deployed -- that's a business I don't know that we would enter. It's going to be more when it joins 2 ends of things that we control. Yes. But there's some in there, but it in the lion's share is clearly from Big 4. Yes. And on the length of the activity, Colby, comments really reflect just the historical norms of the life cycle of the G upgrade going from 1G to the next. Mean when you think about where Verizon is and where AT&T is on C-band, the 3.45 stuff that's not even out yet, and where DISH is, I mean it's pretty easy to see that activity is going to move into 2023. I mean at some point, that has to flat line. I don't know I don't know specifically how to answer that question for next year until we see more about the 3.45 auction and understand some more of the timing. But I think flat line or not, I understand the importance of that from an investor perspective. But I mean we see years of elevated activity. Yes. I clearly do because the spectrum that they're being -- that's being put forth is what's really necessary for the carriers to offer a 5G solution, which they have not yet really embarked up. So much like what's going on here in the U.S. when that spectrum is auctioned and put into use, you're going to have similar activity levels. In terms of the -- you want to speak, Brendan to the increase lease-up? We will build sites next year in every market in which we are currently active. So -- and in most of those markets, more sites than we build today. And we're looking at generally 10%-ish tower cash flow yield on day 1. Yes. That does. Two-thirds to 2035, I believe. Yes. That transaction is supposed -- now the latest thinking is that, that doesn't get consummated until sometime next year. And then with the network rationalization aspects that come out of that not starting until sometime in 2023. Sure. Yes, of course. PG&E is ahead of plan, benefiting from all of the U.S. activity from all the contributors that we earlier discussed in general. So we're extremely pleased with that. And... Ryan, is that it? Or is there another question? Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening, and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter sometime in February. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. SBA had another great quarter with financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into the end of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $535.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $525.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a tailwind though on comparisons to the third quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.2 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% over the third quarter of 2020 including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.3% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was at a similar level to the second quarter, which had represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog continued to grow during the quarter and finished the quarter higher and at a new multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year and into 2022. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 45% of our domestic bookings with 55% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.2% net, including 2.7% of churn or 7.9% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased again quarter-over-quarter and was the highest in over a year. Churn grew some in the quarter as well and is anticipated to increase further as we experience the impacts of carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another quarter of increased leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.5% on a constant currency basis. During the third quarter, 84.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.7% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $428.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 90.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $407 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.7%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business produced record results for the second quarter in a row with $53.8 million in revenue and $12.5 million of segment operating profit. Activity levels remained very high in the quarter, and backlogs also continued to grow, finishing the quarter at another all-time high level in our company's history. Based on our strong third quarter and the growing backlog, we have increased our full year 2021 outlook for site development revenue for the third quarter in a row, now expecting $200 million of site development revenue at the midpoint of our outlook range. AFFO in the third quarter was $302.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.71, an increase of 13.9% over the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 144 communication sites for total cash consideration of $57.1 million. We also built 87 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 1,700 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $231 million, including approximately 1,400 sites and approximately $175 million related to the previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of next year, and we anticipate the Airtel Tanzania transaction to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Consistent with our prior outlook, our updated 2021 outlook assumes that the Airtel acquisition closes at the end of the year. And thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these assets. In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the lands under our sect. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend our lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Notwithstanding our assumption of weaker fourth quarter foreign exchange rates, our updated outlook includes increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases result from high services activity levels with our carrier customers, anticipated timing shifts in domestic consolidation churn, reduced cash interest expense as a result of recent refinancings and the impact of recent share repurchases. We anticipate that our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second and third quarters will be supportive of improved incremental organic domestic leasing revenue in 2022, which we will share on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Ric, it's Brendan. So first of all, you may have noticed in our bridge that we made an adjustment to actually reduce our domestic churn impact for '21. That's basically all due to Sprint. It's a timing issue, though. It's taking them perhaps a little bit longer than we were anticipating because we're making some estimates, obviously, around that heading into it. That doesn't change our view on the total potential exposure for churn, but it shifts the timing back to slightly. So I would expect that to kind of move to next year. In terms of what we expect today, we've given some ranges in the past, and I'll kind of reiterate that. They move a little bit, obviously, as we learn more about it. But this year, in '21, we would expect the total impact to end up being somewhere around $7 million. Next year is a higher year for us based on the timing of when leases hit the end of their terms. We expect it to be probably at the higher end of our previously stated range of $30 million to $35 million. I'd say it's closer to $35 million, mostly because of the shift in timing I just mentioned. And then in 2023 and 2024, we would estimate somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range for impact in each of those years. And our biggest years of exposure are 2025 and '26 where the range would be somewhere in that $45 million-ish range, $40 million to $50 million, say, to put brackets around it for each of those years. And then some de minimis amount after that. In terms of where it's coming from, a lot of it is on overlap sites, but some of it is certainly on sites that are proximity sites. And then in some cases, it's not always totally clear to us. I think they're still working through that. We don't have total vision on what they're doing with other neighboring sites. But I would say it's a mix of the two. But obviously, the greatest focus as it relates to our portfolio will be the sites where they have direct overlap. It's timing. Yes. Walt, this is Brendan. Yes, it seems like thus far, from what we've seen in our communications with them that it's generally still targeting the same thing that we thought originally more or less. I think the shift here is really just the timing on moving off of some of the sites. You may have even seen they talked about some delay in shutting down the CDMA network. I think that probably is a factor in it. So I don't think that the overall focus is shifting at all, but the timing might be slightly different. That's all. So on the international churn, we've been -- as you probably seen and we talked about, I think, on previous calls that we expected some elevated international churn this year. We haven't experienced most of that yet through the year. But in the fourth quarter, we expect to see that jump. Largely due -- the primary reason is due to consolidation-related churn, particularly with Claro and Telefo\u0301nica combining in Guatemala, a lot of the impacts of that are starting to be felt here in the fourth quarter, which is what's going to drive the full year number that we provided. And obviously, with it being so late in the year, it has an impact on what we would expect to report not just in the fourth quarter but in the next -- into next year. In addition, there are -- we are dealing with a number of our customers in Central America. We have some that are working through network changes due to various issues that they face. And others where the terms of the agreements are starting to come to an end, and we're working through what their future plans might look like. So we expect there might be some incremental churn associated with that, but we also would expect longer-term commitments and other business commitments as well as part of that. So it really was an indication mostly though, about the consolidation churn that we're going to experience in Q4. There's been some CapEx spent on the data centers that we acquired. So that might be the incremental piece that we obviously hadn't had in the past. Well, FX. No, it is mostly pass-through expenses. It's actually -- a lot of it is actually related to ground leases, in particular, in Brazil, where we pass those through to the carriers. And that -- part of that is CPI that we didn't -- while we projected CPI increases across our tenant leases, we didn't necessarily include that on the ground leases because it's a pass-through. But as that's starting to come along with the increased inflation down there, it's pushing ground rents higher, which obviously pushes the pass-through rents higher as well, plus there is some power costs, as you mentioned as well. That's the main driver. And then in terms of the nontraditional tenants in the backlog, there are some certainly, Brett, but as a percentage of the total backlog it's pretty small, partially because the big carriers are so active right now that we have huge backlogs with them. And so it's pretty immaterial in terms of its overall impact. Jeff, I'll start on the international churn side. I do expect it to be elevated not only in the fourth quarter but into next year, in part because the fourth quarter -- especially when we report our same-tower churn numbers, it's obviously on a trailing 12 months basis. So what happens in Q4 will be carried with us throughout the balance of the year. So next year will certainly be higher in terms of its full year impact than this year because of the concentration late in the year. Yes. I mean, so the growth rate stepped up, it's really a combination of 2 things. One is the escalators are higher because of the CPI-based increases. And as inflation has increased in Brazil, that's caused our escalators to be increasing. And then we have in addition, seeing increased actual leasing activity over the last 2 quarters where it's sequentially increased over what it had been at the beginning of the year. I think really, as we come out of some of the more serious COVID-related periods in Brazil, we're starting to see the carriers moving back more towards traditional spending levels. And so that's encouraging as well. Yes. There's -- now you're talking about the concession sites, I think, from the acquisition that we did. Yes. No, there's really not, and we expect that we'll -- those will actually be continued on. And actually, those leases extend out, I believe, longer than that with us as a commitment from Hawaii that goes out beyond the... Yes. Yes. I mean, once they reach a level, I mean that -- we're giving the concentrations above 10% of revenue. Obviously, they'd have to achieve that. Their contributions to leasing activity are significant and on par with the other carriers now. But obviously, the total sum of revenue, considering they're starting at zero, is at a much lower percentage. So we ultimately will do that if they achieve that level of contribution. On the balance sheet, the -- just to correct what you said, the average interest rate is now on a pro forma basis, 2.6%. There are potentially some other possibilities. We obviously have maturity dates that come up over the next several years. Really, we'll have to see where interest rates are as we hit those dates. There's probably some opportunity to refinance and have some additional improvement, but I think we've done the vast majority of that now with the last deal that we just completed this past month."

[Operator Instructions] \n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead. \nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Caroline. \n Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. \n In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. \n In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks, Mark. Good evening. \n SBA had a tremendous quarter with results for the second quarter, ahead of our expectations in most key areas. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $524.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $514.6 million. Foreign exchange rates were ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, contributing $3.1 million of incremental site leasing revenue in the second quarter. They were also a tailwind in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.5 million on a year-over-year basis. \n Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.4% over the second quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 5.9%. \n Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.5% on a gross basis and 3% on a net basis, including 2.5% of churn. \n Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was up significantly from the prior quarter and represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog finished the quarter at a multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. \n During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 34% of our domestic bookings with 66% coming from new leases, the first time in many years the bookings from new leases outpaced that from amendments. \n The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 97% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. \n Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.3% net, including 2.2% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased modestly from the first quarter. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had an improved quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 8.9% on a constant currency basis. \n During the second quarter, 84.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. \n Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $421.2 million. Our tower cash flow margins continue to be very strong, with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.7% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.8% or 91% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. \n Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $400.2 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. \n During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the company with $51.4 million in revenue and over $11 million of segment operating profit. The very high activity levels we saw in the first quarter strengthened further in the second quarter, resulting in a quarter end services backlog that was 30% above first quarter levels and was also the highest in our company's history. We expect to see continued high levels of services activity throughout the rest of the year, and as a result, have increased our full year outlook for site development revenue by $25 million from last quarter and by $40 million from our initial outlook. \n AFFO in the second quarter was $293.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.64, an increase of 15.3% over the second quarter of 2020. \n During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 57 communication sites for total cash consideration of $67 million. We also built 98 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase approximately 400 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $95 million, and we anticipate closing on the majority of the sites under contract by the end of the year. \n In addition, during the second quarter, we announced that through a new joint venture arrangement, we have entered into a contract with Airtel Tanzania, a subsidiary of Airtel Africa, to purchase their approximately 1,400 towers in Tanzania. Under this agreement, Airtel will lease back space on each of the towers and will also provide a fixed minimum number of build-to-suit towers during the first 5 years following the closing of the acquisition. \n The total purchase price for the acquisition is expected to be approximately $175 million, and the acquisition is anticipated to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter. For our updated 2021 outlook, we have assumed that the acquisition closes at the end of the year, and thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures, but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these events. \n We expect the assets to produce approximately $18 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first full year of operations under the joint venture. SBA will be the majority partner of the joint venture, and we are partnering with Paradigm Infrastructure Limited, a U.K. company founded by former senior executives of American Tower, which is focused on developing, owning and operating shared path of wireless infrastructure in selected growth markets. \n We believe the combined international tower industry operating experience of SBA and Paradigm will allow us to maximize the opportunity in this new rapidly growing market. \n In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. \n In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Our updated increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases are driven by outperformance across our business, increased network investment activities by our customers, improved foreign exchange rates, reduced nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures and reduced cash interest expense as a result of timely refinancings. \n Notwithstanding our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second quarter, which were ahead of our expectations, we have not increased our 2021 outlook for incremental organic domestic leasing revenue. New bookings typically begin to accrue revenue at the earlier of a date certain or commencement of construction. For outlook purposes, unless we have received notice of construction commencement, we only consider the date certain, which, for the second quarter bookings outperformance generally ranges from late in the fourth quarter to sometime in the first half of 2022. \n As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate our reported gross domestic same-tower revenue growth will begin to increase in the second half of the year and that we will exit 2021 at the highest rate of the year. As is always the case, our full-year 2021 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, when opportunities present, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. \n Our outlook for net cash interest expense does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2021. \n Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 111.5 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. \n With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. \nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. \n We ended the quarter with $12 billion of total debt and $11.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, a return to our target range of 7 to 7.5x, faster than originally anticipated after the PG&E acquisition during the first quarter. \n Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.4x. On May 14, the company, through existing trust, issued $1.165 billion of secured tower revenue securities Series 21-1c, which has an anticipated repayment date of November 9, 2026, and a final maturity date of May 9, 2051. These securities have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.631%, payable monthly. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2017-1c tower securities and for general corporate purposes. \n Then on July 7, the company amended its existing revolving credit facility. Among other things, this amendment increased the total commitments under the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion; in addition, extended the maturity date of the facility to July 7, 2026; lowered the applicable interest rate margins and commitment fees under the facility; and incorporated sustainability-like targets into the facility, allowing for interest rate and commitment fee adjustments based on how we perform against those targets. We are pleased to be one of the first companies to include such sustainability-focused provisions in our credit facility. \n As of today, we have no amounts outstanding under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 2.9% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.5 years. \n During the second quarter, we did not purchase any share of our common stock. As of today, we have $475.1 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase price. The company's shares outstanding at June 30, 2021, were 109.5 million compared to 111.9 million at June 30, 2020, a reduction of 2.1%. \n In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.5 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, which is payable on September 23, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 26, 2021. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 22% of second quarter AFFO per share, which leaves us ample room for material future dividend growth. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone.\n As you have heard, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter, one of our best in quite some time. Domestically, our customers were extremely active. This quarter, we signed up more new leasing revenue than we have in any quarter in 7 years. We believe the second quarter was the start of a multiyear increase in U.S. wireless carrier CapEx. \n Our backlogs of lease and amendment applications ended up near record highs at the end of the quarter, notwithstanding the high levels of bookings, which obviously bodes well for activity levels throughout the rest of the year and into next. \n Our customers are focused on building out their 5G networks with a particular focus on upgrading their macro networks. Leasing activity levels were driven by initial C-band initiatives, 2.5 gigahertz deployments, FirstNet amendments, general coverage expansion and the beginning of DISH's network build-out. These initiatives also drove our services volumes to record highs. \n Last quarter, I was pleased to discuss how our first quarter services results were the best in 7 years, but that didn't last long as we reported 18% more services revenue in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, producing over $51 million of quarterly revenue, the highest in our company's history. We also finished the quarter with the highest services backlog in our history. These results allowed us to increase our full-year services outlook by $25 million. As you could tell, our domestic customers are very busy right now. That sets us up for a very good 2021 and 2022. \n Internationally, the second quarter was also very solid for us, with quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and increasing CPI-based escalators in a number of our markets. During the quarter, we signed up 45% of new international revenue through new leases and 55% through amendments to existing leases. Our increased leasing results were driven by our 2 largest markets, Brazil and South Africa. These markets are still being affected at a greater level than here in the U.S. by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Our local teams, though, continue to perform very well and we believe we remain well positioned to benefit from increased network investment from our carrier customers as conditions improve and new spectrum auctions take place over the next year, including, for example, the just completed 3.5 gigahertz auction in Canada, which raised proceeds well above expectations. Similar options of 5G-suitable spectrum are planned in the near term in a number of our markets, including Brazil. \n Even with this positive momentum, perhaps the most exciting international news from the quarter was regarding our pending acquisition from Airtel Tanzania. We have partnered with Paradigm Infrastructure for this opportunity. Paradigm was founded by and is run by several former American Tower executives well known to us, including those that were responsible for their initial African expansion and operations. Paradigm will be both the financial investor and an operational partner in this venture. \n As a market, Tanzania provides many opportunities. The country has a large growing population and has consistently produced good GDP growth, and the new president has indicated a greater commitment to policies that encourage foreign business investment. Despite Tanzania's growth, the mobile penetration rate is still only 41% today, creating significant opportunity for incremental wireless investment and expansion. \n The wireless market is predominantly made up of 3 major carriers who are relatively well balanced in terms of market share, Vodacom, Airtel and Axian, who recently bought Tigo's operations in Tanzania. Each of these MNOs are focused on expanding their infrastructure in Tanzania. Airtel will be using a substantial amount of the proceeds from the sale of its sites to increase CapEx spending. \n Likewise, Axian is an African-focused and experienced operator whose plans include a strong investment in the country to improve the existing Tigo network. We are purchasing Airtel's approximately 1,400 wireless towers, which have a current tenancy ratio of just under 1.5 tenants per tower, including Airtel, and the majority of the existing revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.  Approximately 3/4 of the sites are located on the power grid. And for those that are not requiring provision of energy, the cost will be passed through to the tenants. \n We believe there will be opportunities to not only organically grow our revenues on existing towers, but also to expand our tower portfolio in Tanzania, including through a build-to-suit commitment from Airtel over the next 5 years, which was part of the transaction. The combination of our partnership with Paradigm, the attractive price paid for the assets and the growth characteristics of the Tanzanian market support our belief that this will be a value-creating new market for SBA in the same way we have created material value in South Africa and Latin America on a country-specific basis without any requirement for further regional or geographic expansion. We're very excited about this new SBA market. \n In addition to our strong second quarter operating results, our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended the quarter at 7.3x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 turns, 1 quarter after absorbing the large first quarter PG&E transaction, demonstrating the ability of our business to rapidly organically delever. \n During the quarter, we completed a new asset-backed financing at the lowest fixed cost interest rate for any non-equity-linked security in our history. Shortly after quarter end, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $250 million and extended the term. These activities continue to drive our liquidity position higher and our weighted average borrowing cost lower for the first time below 3% to 2.9%. \n We have no debt maturities until 2023, and we continue to have access to low-cost debt with additional opportunities to continue to improve our overall cost of debt financing. Our liquidity position and balance sheet and our approach with regard to leverage have allowed us to drive incremental AFFO per share and incremental value for our shareholders. We feel really good about our capital structure. \n Things are going very well right now here at SBA. Our customers are pleasing. Our financial position is strong, and our team members are the best in the industry. We are excited about the opportunities that lay ahead. \n I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success, and we look forward to sharing our results with you as we move through the year. \n And with that, Caroline, we are ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. \nRic Prentiss: A couple of questions. First, obviously, PG&E was a big transaction. We saw a story come out in the last few weeks that they plan to bury like 10,000 miles of electric line. Is there going to be any changes to the sites you've got, where they might be taking electrical lines down, making it obviously easier to couple on them? And what kind of interest activity have you seen on those sites? \nJeffrey Stoops: We've seen great activity. We're ahead of plan, and there's a lot of demand in terms of application backlogs. \n And in terms of that story, Ric, that relates primarily to the lower wood poles, the ones that are closer to the end user as opposed to the high-power transmission poles that are the ones that were really are part of our transaction. \n So we don't see a lot of issues related with that. But if, in fact, there are poles or assets that were part of our transaction, there's a fairly elaborate -- if anything should happen to those in terms of being no longer needed or used by PG&E, there's a fairly complex set of rules that deal with that. So something that we're covered on and feel very good about. But for the most part, it's going to be the shorter wood poles that they're talking about. \nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. Okay. Also, the Tanzania joint venture, one of your peers recently, doing a big private equity transaction in Europe, has started giving consolidated AFFO per share as well as attributable to common AFFO per share. \n Have you guys considered, as now you get a little more joint ventures going, that you might move to, obviously, EPS stories. They are -- always take out minority interest. But any thought about moving towards a measure of a more proportionate AFFO to common? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Ric, to this point, obviously, nothing has been material enough to do that. We do always back out -- we've previously identified when we haven't consolidated something. Obviously, the JV piece of the AFFO per share. But it's something we'll look at. If it becomes material, we'll highlight it for you guys. We just haven't had any, really, to date. \nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. Final one, obviously, we make that adjustment from AFFO to funds available for distribution. We've been watching, I think you guys call it, amortization of capital contributions, which is still very low. I think it was $13 million in the first half of this year, $33 million all of last year. One of your peers has almost 20x that level of noncash items that get put into AFFO. \n Any thoughts of any changes coming from you that would take it up higher? Or is it fairly low? Because it's obviously one of the big noncash items that kind of is different between the tower companies. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean I don't think so, Ric. The things that would drive it up is obviously more augmentation activity of the towers, which is certainly possible, given the increased amount of activity in general that we're seeing. But the offset to that is that as we have longer terms to our leases, particularly the Verizon MLA, which we talked about last quarter, and some of the new agreements that come with longer term, that tends to stretch out the period over which you're amortizing and actually reduces the amount. \n Plus just -- it's a factor of which towers are getting hit, whether work needs to be done at the site, how much cost is being reimbursed, all those kind of things. So I don't expect it to actually move up materially at any point in the next year or 2. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. It's very different, Ric, when you're not doing small cell fiber work where it's more common that your customer contributes a large amount of the initial CapEx upfront, then you amortize it into that amount. I mean, that's never really been a big issue in the macro tower side of the business other than just the regular augmentation stuff, which is -- we don't foresee any material changes in that. \nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. Obviously, I always like going back to cash and the ability to pay dividends. So I appreciate that, and you guys stay well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: I was wondering if you've had any more clarity from T-Mobile about their plans for the Sprint towers. Do you think the churn is going to be consistent with the current contracts? Or do you think there's the potential to either keep some of those towers or have them pushed out? \n And any updates on the Oi restructuring and how we should think about the impact maybe opening up the potential for more investment in Brazil once that goes through? \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the T-Mobile-Sprint question, Simon, T-Mobile is very organized and very, I think, ahead of what people thought in terms of their network planning. So there's a lot of crisp communications going back and forth. But I don't know that it materially has changed our prior statements on what we expect in terms of decommissioning. And we don't have any additional news on the uptake of the potential Sprint sites. But I would just say that T-Mobile is very prepared in their work in this area. \n In terms of Oi, I believe the latest is that we're not expecting anything until at least the fourth quarter of this year, maybe into next. And our prior statements in terms of our exposures to both -- or to all 3 of TIM, Tigo and Claro, those have not changed. \nSimon Flannery: Okay. Great. And do you think there's an opportunity for you to do more on build-to-suit? I think you did about 100 in the quarter. And then it sounds like it's part of the Tanzania story as well, but you haven't done a huge amount relative to what we've been hearing from some of your peers. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. I think there's always an opportunity. The question is does it represent the terms and the financial returns that we're looking for. I think the universe of opportunities would allow us to do more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. \nPhilip Cusick: It's Phil Cusick. Start with the Paradigm deal. Was this the team you worked with from South Africa? Or is this a different team? \nJeffrey Stoops: No. We didn't work with any of the AMT guys in South Africa, Phil. This is Steve Marshall and Hal Hess and Steve Harris, guys that I've known forever. And worked very closely with Steve Marshall at WIA. So that's really just through the industry, this all came together. \nPhilip Cusick: Okay. What's your potential capital commitment over time for this? \nJeffrey Stoops: Well, it's not much beyond the $175 million. I mean, Brendan what's... \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, that's the total purchase price, the $175 million plus a few incremental costs. So that represents everything. So it wouldn't be materially more than that. I mean down the road, we'll have to see how things... \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean we've modeled in some upgrade CapEx and some refurbishment CapEx, but talking about material numbers there as well. \nPhilip Cusick: Okay. It just sounds like if you're going to do something like this in a whole bunch of new countries, it's -- I would think you have a sort of number that you'd be willing to invest alongside them to make these more interesting over time. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. The JV, Phil, is specific to Tanzania. There's no obligation to do anything alongside them going forward. So there's no commitment as far as that goes. \nJeffrey Stoops: If we could find more opportunities like Tanzania, though, we'd be excited. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. \nMichael Rollins: With respect to the domestic leasing activity that you were highlighting just earlier in the call, how does this compare with the internal expectations that you've had? And what does this mean to the levels of gross leasing growth that you can achieve in the domestic business over the next couple of years? \n And then just separately, I just wanted to follow up on another thing that was said earlier. I was just curious if you could unpack why the mix of leasing activity had a greater amount of new sites versus amendments in the domestic business? \nJeffrey Stoops: Well, the last one is an easy one to answer, Mike, and it's DISH. Because DISH is coming online in the form of entirely new leases, and they're very busy. So that's the answer to that. \n In terms of the second quarter, we achieved results that were ahead of our expectations. We did have some fairly robust expectations, but even those were exceeded by the level of second quarter activity. \n And in terms of the growth rate going forward, I don't want to get too specific other than to say it's going up. \nMichael Rollins: In the past, I think, and you can correct me if I don't have this right, were you talking, I think, high single digits of where you expect the gross domestic growth to get over the next few years? I'm just curious if you could just revisit that perspective. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Mike, from a growth standpoint, we certainly expect it to be mid- to high single digits in the future given what's going on now. So yes, when you're talking about going out a lot of years, obviously, we're getting bigger and bigger, so you have to add that many more dollars to make that happen. But given the activity levels today, I think as we get a year or so out, you'll start to see us return to levels that are similar to what we've reported in the past when we were busier. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. \nNicholas Del Deo: First, for the question that Mike just asked, it sounds like DISH was really an outsized contributor to leasing this quarter. Can you just -- if you back that out, can you talk about how activity from the big 3 carriers, in particular, has changed over recent quarters? Was it DISH in particular that really drove the outperformance in leasing versus your expectation? Or was that outperformance more broad-based? \nJeffrey Stoops: I would say that the ones that had kind of step function changes in their levels of activity were DISH and Verizon. And the Verizon story is very understandable. It's coming off the C-band auctions, their public statements and our MLA with them. \nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then one on Tanzania and the partnership with Paradigm, do you have an option to eventually buy out their stake or vice versa? Or is there no mechanism in place to do that? \nJeffrey Stoops: No, there is a mechanism that gives us the right to buy them out. \nNicholas Del Deo: Can you talk about the time frame or any other parameters? Or is that proprietary? \nJeffrey Stoops: It's not proprietary. It's 5 years-ish. Might be a reason why it gets accelerated a year or extended a year, but that's generally the time frame that we're looking at. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. \nBrett Feldman: Following up a little bit on C-band. Now that you're starting to see what some of the carriers are doing with C-band, how much visibility do you have and to the extent to which that's mostly going to be a significant amendment project versus any visibility into a new site project? Because for all of the operators that you already have as tenants are on 1 C-band. This would be a higher frequency than anything they've ever historically used on a macro site. So it would apply that they might need densification, but I don't know if you have that visibility at this point in time. \n And then just following up on the services backlog, I'm just curious, is all of that services work being done on your towers, meaning is it a fairly good leading indicator of what your own leasing is? Or are you actually winning a degree of the business across other portfolios as well? \nJeffrey Stoops: The answer to your last question is yes. It is mostly all on our towers, which is why we have the confidence we have. \n And in terms of your first question, Brett, there will be some leases in there. But for T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T, it's going to be mostly amendments. And for DISH, it's going to all be new leases. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from LightShed. \nWalter Piecyk: Jeff, I'll preface this question by noting that last quarter, your average -- price of your share repurchases, I think, $258, and the stock is now $340 or $342. But in this quarter, you didn't buy anything. \n So I'm just kind of curious, is this -- I mean, I know this acquisition was, whatever, $175 million, is kind of in the ballpark of what you spent last quarter. Is that the connection that we should draw? Or is it maybe where the stock price is in terms of the activity this quarter? \nJeffrey Stoops: No. We wanted to come down off the 7.6%, and we came down quicker than we thought. And by the time we knew that, we were blacked out. \nWalter Piecyk: Got it. And then on the domestic ramp, when you look at your guidance for new lease activity, it's obviously very high, so there's going to be a ramp. Can you give us a sense of Q3 versus Q4? \n I mean obviously, we're going to have to see some type of jump in Q3, but is the bigger jump really going to occur in Q4 in terms of the new lease activity? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. You're talking about the same-tower growth rate, Walt, alright? Yes. \nWalter Piecyk: Yes, right. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We expect it to step up sequentially each of the next 2 quarters, but certainly, the fourth quarter would be a bigger step-up is our expectation based on the timing of when this -- the stuff we're signing... \nWalter Piecyk: Orders and stuff came in, yes. That makes sense. And then, I mean if -- T-Mobile is got to be a component of that. I mean, doesn't this kind of speak to the timing of how their integration is going, if it's still like more of a Q4 event? \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. I mean they're busy. They're busy and... \nWalter Piecyk: But they're not getting them activated in Q3, right? It's still not happening until Q4 for them. \nBrendan Cavanagh: They're getting stuff activated in Q3 as well. So I mean, it's a mix question, Walt, but they're busy in activating stuff in both -- we expect in both quarters. \nWalter Piecyk: It's just interesting given that C-band is right around the corner for Verizon, and they're still kind of back-end loaded, but whatever. \n And then international, that's also a big number. So that's going to be a big ramp second half, then, for international as well, right? To hit that $13 million target? \nJeffrey Stoops: It will be a slight ramp. I don't know if I would call it a big ramp. we can walk through that number... \nWalter Piecyk: Slight relative to the overall company for sure, but for international -- for what your levels have been in the first half of the year, it seems like it's kind of big now? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's increasing. I mean, certainly, the lease-up has been a little bit better just recently, and we expect it to be better as we move through the year. I don't know that I would agree with your characterization, though, so we should probably talk about that separately. \nWalter Piecyk: Sure. Okay. One last one then, sorry. But T-Mobile's use of DISH's 600 megahertz spectrum, did that generate an amendment or a colocation or anything? \nJeffrey Stoops: It will when it happens. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. \nBatya Levi: A couple of follow-ups. First, can you provide some color on the pacing of Sprint churn for this year? I think it was close to $2 million in the first quarter. How do we think about it for the rest of the year and maybe a color if that $13 billion still holds for next year? \n And another question on the services side. The margins are coming in a little bit lighter than historical levels. Is there any opportunity to improve the services margins? And how do we think about the '22 services revenues? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Batya, on the Sprint churn piece, it's expected -- we had, I think, what we reported last time was about $1.7 million or so in the first quarter. We expect the full year to be somewhere between $8 million, maybe $8 million to $9 million or so for the year, the fourth quarter impact. And this is, again, on a full-year, year-over-year basis. Will be a little bit bigger because, obviously, there are some of those leases that are going away as we move through the year. \n In terms of next year, right now, we still think maybe $30 million to $35 million or so is appropriate. I have to hedge a little bit only because the timing of when we get notice is, what they specifically decided to do, is a little bit of a fluid situation. But based on what we know today and lease expiration dates, that we think that's a reasonable estimate. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. In terms of the services margins, I mean, our services business is comprised of 2 distinct offerings. One is site acquisition, zoning, kind of soft work; and then the second is construction. Construction typically produces about half the margin of site ac and zoning. So the mix between site ac, zoning and construction is what drives the margin. And the margins have actually been, based on the type of work being provided, historically strong compared to QR experience. \n In terms of next year, I mean, we'll give you next year's guidance when we get there, but there's no reason why the services business, because it is primarily on our own towers, should materially slow down. It's going to reflect leasing activity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: Just a follow-up on a couple of things. So I guess, first, Jeff, I think last quarter, when we were talking about the services business, you said you didn't see any reason for there to be a material change to Q-on-Q. Obviously, there was a change. \n You kind of listed off a number of things that were contributing factors, but was it really like how quickly the C-band deployment came out of the gates? Or was it really how quickly maybe T-Mobile came out of the gates? Or was it just everything just turned out to be better than expected? \nJeffrey Stoops: Really more of the latter. I mean C-band came out quicker. DISH came out quicker. T-Mobile continues to be extremely strong. \nDavid Barden: And just with respect to the disappointment, maybe you can comment on this, maybe you can't. But is it -- they've obviously publicly announced what their plan is, to build out the Vegas market. Is this the kind of bump that you saw specifically related to that? Or is there something grander that's going on that maybe we haven't heard about yet? \nJeffrey Stoops: Our work is pretty well spread out, David. I'm not sure exactly how they geographically define those comments you made, but we're seeing a fair spread to the geography. \nDavid Barden: Okay, interesting. So just a couple of housekeeping ones. The Tanzania contract, is that all denominated in shillings? \nBrendan Cavanagh: The purchase price? Are you asking about the purchase price or the leaseback? \nDavid Barden: The leasing, the leasing contract. \nBrendan Cavanagh: It's roughly -- well, this includes the other third parties, so I don't know the exact breakdown. But the total leasing revenue that's contracted is about 67% in U.S. dollars, when you exclude the pass-through stuff. \nJeffrey Stoops: Most of the space is rented in U.S. dollars, the energy pass-through is all shillings. \nDavid Barden: Got it. Got it. Okay. Then my last one, if I could, sorry. The roughly $100 million, $95 million, that's not Tanzania that you guys invested. Where did you guys put that money this quarter? \nJeffrey Stoops: I'm sorry, the what? \nDavid Barden: Sorry, the $95 million to $100 million that you guys -- that's not part of the Tanzania deal that got spent this quarter, where did that go? \nJeffrey Stoops: The $95 million discretionary CapEx? \nDavid Barden: Correct. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, yes. Went into various acquisitions, also some new builds. We mentioned, we built about 100 sites during the quarter, so the total CapEx was up for a number of deals. The deals -- if you're asking where the deals were located, it was a mix. They were mostly deals in the U.S. in this quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: I was wondering on AT&T, you didn't mention them as one of the customers that had a step-change function in activity. Have you seen any change from them since they announced the WarnerMedia spin-off around C-band urgency? \n And you mentioned FirstNet as well in your comments. We have presumed that was starting to wind down, but maybe you could comment how much longer you expect FirstNet amendment to persist. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, AT&T is relatively steady. Did not have the same change in velocity that some of the others that we mentioned did. \n And the FirstNet stuff, I think we are past -- well past the halfway point, but not close to being finished. \nEric Luebchow: Okay. Fair enough. And just wondering, too, is there any update or anything to point out on SBA Edge, the data center platform, in terms of deal activity? And any update on timing when that could potentially become a modestly more material part of the business? \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. I believe, and I just heard this today internally that we've now gotten our third contract for a true mobile edge computing site, so that would give us 2 data centers and 3 or 4 mobile edge facilities. So moving forward, but quite a bit of ways away for reaching that materiality point you referred to. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen. \nColby Synesael: You mentioned the JV's $175 million. I'm just curious what's your ownership stake of that. And why the JV? You obviously can afford to do that straight up on your own. Is that meant to signal some type of shift in strategies or simply they're the ones that brought the deal to you and therefore, were allowed to take a piece of it? \n And then secondly, the new AT&T-DISH partnership. I'm curious if you view that as incrementally negative or positive to your business and I guess just the broader tower industry. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. The Paradigm folks were responsible for bringing the deal to us, Colby, and had a long relationship with Airtel in Tanzania with their former employer. So that's why we're where we are. I don't think we're disclosing the exact split, other than we are clearly the majority owner in all facets. \n In terms of the AT&T-DISH deal, it doesn't really change DISH's requirements with the FCC, which is for their own fixed network. Arguably, it could impact their growth beyond that to just roll on AT&T's network. But we'll have to see. I mean, pruning never is the first economic choice. But I mean, it certainly hasn't in any way impacted DISH's case out of the blocks here in 2021. \nColby Synesael: I just had a quick follow-up. One of the parts of that agreement is the ability for DISH to effectively give some of its spectrum to AT&T to deploy in its behalf, to which then, DISH can use. \n Do you know if that would meet the threshold that the FCC has in terms of their 70% coverage requirement by 2023, i.e., they could effectively just go on AT&T's towers using their spectrum and that would meet the requirement wherever they may choose to do that? \nJeffrey Stoops: I don't know the answer to that. \nColby Synesael: Neither do I, but thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew Niknam: Just on capital allocation, now that you're back within your target leverage range, I'm wondering how you're thinking about that and how you're sort of prioritizing uses of excess cash post the dividend? \n And then specifically on the M&A front as well, if you can talk about the latest you're seeing, both in terms of valuations and number of opportunities, particularly internationally. \nJeffrey Stoops: Well, the number of opportunities internationally is high. Prices are high. You need to be very selective. I don't know that we will be able to do a bunch of things like we're doing in Tanzania. I hope we can, but I don't know that, that will be the case. \n In terms of capital allocation, generally, we continue to believe our shareholders are best suited by a \"lower dividend, higher dividend growth strategy\". Gives us the most flexibility, produces very good growth numbers. So that's what we will continue to pursue there. \n And given our access to capital and interest rates, we will look to stay fully invested within our target leverage range, whether that be portfolio growth or stock repurchases. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research. \nJeffrey Kvaal: Yes. I guess, first, would you mind offering us an update on how close you are to bumping up against supply or labor challenges in this market? \nJeffrey Stoops: So far, so good. We really haven't seen any issues on the labor side. I mean the fact that we maintain a sizable in-house crew gives us some flexibility there. \n And in terms of the equipment side, we've not heard any issues around our customers delivering the equipment to the sites for installation. Now we read about all the same semiconductor issues that you read about, so I guess that could change, but it has not manifested itself so far. \nJeffrey Kvaal: Okay. And then secondly, I think Brett asked earlier about potential for densification on the higher frequencies of C-band. What are you hearing from your carrier partners about their propensity to add some cells? Or do you think that they will figure it out with better antennas, et cetera, et cetera? \nJeffrey Stoops: There'll be densification. But just like every generational upgrade, you go first to your existing sites because that's the quickest, the best bang for your buck. So this is happening exactly like it always does. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino from Green Street. \nDavid Guarino: Can you remind us of the company's views on expanding into new markets and if there's any off limits? And then assuming you are open to expanding into new markets, how do you determine whether or not to utilize a JV partner? \nJeffrey Stoops: The last part of your question is based on what they would bring to the table and mostly operational context as opposed to capital, at least so far. And in terms of -- there are certainly ones that are off-limits, either by choice or by legal necessity, places like Cuba and China. I mean, we're just not allowed to go there. \n And then there will be others where the analysis of the risks outweigh the rewards. In a country where you have very little rule of law and you have the potential for nationalization of assets, those are not going to be markets where we're most excited about. \nDavid Guarino: That makes sense. And then how do you handicap the risk in those markets? And I guess, particularly with the Tanzania acquisition, is there a model you guys have internally that you use? Just with -- curious how you think about... \nJeffrey Stoops: We look at all kinds of things. And when you get into markets in Africa, most of the work is not around the assets as much as it is around political, regulatory, tax, government. And we spend a lot of time and taking a lot of resources before we make those decisions. \nDavid Guarino: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one last quick one. On the unoccupied towers, the 28,000 as part of the PG&E transaction, is any activity from those sites showing up in your service revenue yet? Or is it still too early for that? \nJeffrey Stoops: It wouldn't show up in our services revenue. The way that, that would -- that would be leasing revenue. I'm just not -- I know we have some interest. I don't know if we've actually booked anything or not. Do you know, Brendan? \nBrendan Cavanagh: I don't believe so. Not yet. \nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBrandon Nispel: You mentioned backlog a couple of times, Jeff. Can you quantify the year-over-year change in backlog of signed but not commenced new leases this quarter? \n And then just more broadly on build-to-suit, one of your peers has large-scale build-to-suit program going on. Can you share with us how many towers you plan on building in Tanzania and maybe how you're thinking about build-to-suit more broadly over the next 2 to 3 years? \nJeffrey Stoops: Brendan, do we have the answer to the last part? \nBrendan Cavanagh: I don't have the exact number for you, Brandon. It's materially higher, I can say, generally. But we can actually look for something to maybe put a percentage increase or something on that for you after the call. \nJeffrey Stoops: Yes. And in terms of the new-builds in Tanzania, we're committed to build hundreds of towers over the next 5 years. The hope is we increase that. \n I would point to South Africa, which we -- which is now, I believe, over 1,500 towers, most of which were built. So there's a lot of opportunity there, and we will continue to press it in those areas where we think it's going to provide great returns. \nBrandon Nispel: And remind us what you are generally looking for in terms of returns from like an NOI yield perspective on build-to-suit sites. \nJeffrey Stoops: Well, we're looking for towers that, ultimately, either with the first, although that's more unlikely, but with the second get to a 15% cash on investment yield or higher. \n I want to thank everyone for tuning in today. And stay tuned, and we look forward to the next time we're together with third quarter results. Thank you. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone.\n As you have heard, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter, one of our best in quite some time. Domestically, our customers were extremely active. This quarter, we signed up more new leasing revenue than we have in any quarter in 7 years. We believe the second quarter was the start of a multiyear increase in U.S. wireless carrier CapEx. \n Our backlogs of lease and amendment applications ended up near record highs at the end of the quarter, notwithstanding the high levels of bookings, which obviously bodes well for activity levels throughout the rest of the year and into next. \n Our customers are focused on building out their 5G networks with a particular focus on upgrading their macro networks. Leasing activity levels were driven by initial C-band initiatives, 2.5 gigahertz deployments, FirstNet amendments, general coverage expansion and the beginning of DISH's network build-out. These initiatives also drove our services volumes to record highs. \n Last quarter, I was pleased to discuss how our first quarter services results were the best in 7 years, but that didn't last long as we reported 18% more services revenue in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, producing over $51 million of quarterly revenue, the highest in our company's history. We also finished the quarter with the highest services backlog in our history. These results allowed us to increase our full-year services outlook by $25 million. As you could tell, our domestic customers are very busy right now. That sets us up for a very good 2021 and 2022. \n Internationally, the second quarter was also very solid for us, with quarter-over-quarter sequential increases in new lease and amendment executions and increasing CPI-based escalators in a number of our markets. During the quarter, we signed up 45% of new international revenue through new leases and 55% through amendments to existing leases. Our increased leasing results were driven by our 2 largest markets, Brazil and South Africa. These markets are still being affected at a greater level than here in the U.S. by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Our local teams, though, continue to perform very well and we believe we remain well positioned to benefit from increased network investment from our carrier customers as conditions improve and new spectrum auctions take place over the next year, including, for example, the just completed 3.5 gigahertz auction in Canada, which raised proceeds well above expectations. Similar options of 5G-suitable spectrum are planned in the near term in a number of our markets, including Brazil. \n Even with this positive momentum, perhaps the most exciting international news from the quarter was regarding our pending acquisition from Airtel Tanzania. We have partnered with Paradigm Infrastructure for this opportunity. Paradigm was founded by and is run by several former American Tower executives well known to us, including those that were responsible for their initial African expansion and operations. Paradigm will be both the financial investor and an operational partner in this venture. \n As a market, Tanzania provides many opportunities. The country has a large growing population and has consistently produced good GDP growth, and the new president has indicated a greater commitment to policies that encourage foreign business investment. Despite Tanzania's growth, the mobile penetration rate is still only 41% today, creating significant opportunity for incremental wireless investment and expansion. \n The wireless market is predominantly made up of 3 major carriers who are relatively well balanced in terms of market share, Vodacom, Airtel and Axian, who recently bought Tigo's operations in Tanzania. Each of these MNOs are focused on expanding their infrastructure in Tanzania. Airtel will be using a substantial amount of the proceeds from the sale of its sites to increase CapEx spending. \n Likewise, Axian is an African-focused and experienced operator whose plans include a strong investment in the country to improve the existing Tigo network. We are purchasing Airtel's approximately 1,400 wireless towers, which have a current tenancy ratio of just under 1.5 tenants per tower, including Airtel, and the majority of the existing revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars.  Approximately 3/4 of the sites are located on the power grid. And for those that are not requiring provision of energy, the cost will be passed through to the tenants. \n We believe there will be opportunities to not only organically grow our revenues on existing towers, but also to expand our tower portfolio in Tanzania, including through a build-to-suit commitment from Airtel over the next 5 years, which was part of the transaction. The combination of our partnership with Paradigm, the attractive price paid for the assets and the growth characteristics of the Tanzanian market support our belief that this will be a value-creating new market for SBA in the same way we have created material value in South Africa and Latin America on a country-specific basis without any requirement for further regional or geographic expansion. We're very excited about this new SBA market. \n In addition to our strong second quarter operating results, our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended the quarter at 7.3x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 turns, 1 quarter after absorbing the large first quarter PG&E transaction, demonstrating the ability of our business to rapidly organically delever. \n During the quarter, we completed a new asset-backed financing at the lowest fixed cost interest rate for any non-equity-linked security in our history. Shortly after quarter end, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility by $250 million and extended the term. These activities continue to drive our liquidity position higher and our weighted average borrowing cost lower for the first time below 3% to 2.9%. \n We have no debt maturities until 2023, and we continue to have access to low-cost debt with additional opportunities to continue to improve our overall cost of debt financing. Our liquidity position and balance sheet and our approach with regard to leverage have allowed us to drive incremental AFFO per share and incremental value for our shareholders. We feel really good about our capital structure. \n Things are going very well right now here at SBA. Our customers are pleasing. Our financial position is strong, and our team members are the best in the industry. We are excited about the opportunities that lay ahead. \n I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and their contributions to our success, and we look forward to sharing our results with you as we move through the year. \n And with that, Caroline, we are ready for questions. We've seen great activity. We're ahead of plan, and there's a lot of demand in terms of application backlogs. \n And in terms of that story, Ric, that relates primarily to the lower wood poles, the ones that are closer to the end user as opposed to the high-power transmission poles that are the ones that were really are part of our transaction. \n So we don't see a lot of issues related with that. But if, in fact, there are poles or assets that were part of our transaction, there's a fairly elaborate -- if anything should happen to those in terms of being no longer needed or used by PG&E, there's a fairly complex set of rules that deal with that. So something that we're covered on and feel very good about. But for the most part, it's going to be the shorter wood poles that they're talking about. Yes. It's very different, Ric, when you're not doing small cell fiber work where it's more common that your customer contributes a large amount of the initial CapEx upfront, then you amortize it into that amount. I mean, that's never really been a big issue in the macro tower side of the business other than just the regular augmentation stuff, which is -- we don't foresee any material changes in that. Yes. In terms of the T-Mobile-Sprint question, Simon, T-Mobile is very organized and very, I think, ahead of what people thought in terms of their network planning. So there's a lot of crisp communications going back and forth. But I don't know that it materially has changed our prior statements on what we expect in terms of decommissioning. And we don't have any additional news on the uptake of the potential Sprint sites. But I would just say that T-Mobile is very prepared in their work in this area. \n In terms of Oi, I believe the latest is that we're not expecting anything until at least the fourth quarter of this year, maybe into next. And our prior statements in terms of our exposures to both -- or to all 3 of TIM, Tigo and Claro, those have not changed. Yes. I think there's always an opportunity. The question is does it represent the terms and the financial returns that we're looking for. I think the universe of opportunities would allow us to do more. No. We didn't work with any of the AMT guys in South Africa, Phil. This is Steve Marshall and Hal Hess and Steve Harris, guys that I've known forever. And worked very closely with Steve Marshall at WIA. So that's really just through the industry, this all came together. Well, it's not much beyond the $175 million. I mean, Brendan what's... Yes. I mean we've modeled in some upgrade CapEx and some refurbishment CapEx, but talking about material numbers there as well. If we could find more opportunities like Tanzania, though, we'd be excited. Well, the last one is an easy one to answer, Mike, and it's DISH. Because DISH is coming online in the form of entirely new leases, and they're very busy. So that's the answer to that. \n In terms of the second quarter, we achieved results that were ahead of our expectations. We did have some fairly robust expectations, but even those were exceeded by the level of second quarter activity. \n And in terms of the growth rate going forward, I don't want to get too specific other than to say it's going up. I would say that the ones that had kind of step function changes in their levels of activity were DISH and Verizon. And the Verizon story is very understandable. It's coming off the C-band auctions, their public statements and our MLA with them. No, there is a mechanism that gives us the right to buy them out. It's not proprietary. It's 5 years-ish. Might be a reason why it gets accelerated a year or extended a year, but that's generally the time frame that we're looking at. The answer to your last question is yes. It is mostly all on our towers, which is why we have the confidence we have. \n And in terms of your first question, Brett, there will be some leases in there. But for T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T, it's going to be mostly amendments. And for DISH, it's going to all be new leases. No. We wanted to come down off the 7.6%, and we came down quicker than we thought. And by the time we knew that, we were blacked out. Yes. I mean they're busy. They're busy and... It will be a slight ramp. I don't know if I would call it a big ramp. we can walk through that number... It will when it happens. Yes. In terms of the services margins, I mean, our services business is comprised of 2 distinct offerings. One is site acquisition, zoning, kind of soft work; and then the second is construction. Construction typically produces about half the margin of site ac and zoning. So the mix between site ac, zoning and construction is what drives the margin. And the margins have actually been, based on the type of work being provided, historically strong compared to QR experience. \n In terms of next year, I mean, we'll give you next year's guidance when we get there, but there's no reason why the services business, because it is primarily on our own towers, should materially slow down. It's going to reflect leasing activity. Really more of the latter. I mean C-band came out quicker. DISH came out quicker. T-Mobile continues to be extremely strong. Our work is pretty well spread out, David. I'm not sure exactly how they geographically define those comments you made, but we're seeing a fair spread to the geography. Most of the space is rented in U.S. dollars, the energy pass-through is all shillings. I'm sorry, the what? The $95 million discretionary CapEx? Yes, yes. Went into various acquisitions, also some new builds. We mentioned, we built about 100 sites during the quarter, so the total CapEx was up for a number of deals. The deals -- if you're asking where the deals were located, it was a mix. They were mostly deals in the U.S. in this quarter. Yes, AT&T is relatively steady. Did not have the same change in velocity that some of the others that we mentioned did. \n And the FirstNet stuff, I think we are past -- well past the halfway point, but not close to being finished. Yes. I believe, and I just heard this today internally that we've now gotten our third contract for a true mobile edge computing site, so that would give us 2 data centers and 3 or 4 mobile edge facilities. So moving forward, but quite a bit of ways away for reaching that materiality point you referred to. Yes. The Paradigm folks were responsible for bringing the deal to us, Colby, and had a long relationship with Airtel in Tanzania with their former employer. So that's why we're where we are. I don't think we're disclosing the exact split, other than we are clearly the majority owner in all facets. \n In terms of the AT&T-DISH deal, it doesn't really change DISH's requirements with the FCC, which is for their own fixed network. Arguably, it could impact their growth beyond that to just roll on AT&T's network. But we'll have to see. I mean, pruning never is the first economic choice. But I mean, it certainly hasn't in any way impacted DISH's case out of the blocks here in 2021. I don't know the answer to that. Well, the number of opportunities internationally is high. Prices are high. You need to be very selective. I don't know that we will be able to do a bunch of things like we're doing in Tanzania. I hope we can, but I don't know that, that will be the case. \n In terms of capital allocation, generally, we continue to believe our shareholders are best suited by a \"lower dividend, higher dividend growth strategy\". Gives us the most flexibility, produces very good growth numbers. So that's what we will continue to pursue there. \n And given our access to capital and interest rates, we will look to stay fully invested within our target leverage range, whether that be portfolio growth or stock repurchases. So far, so good. We really haven't seen any issues on the labor side. I mean the fact that we maintain a sizable in-house crew gives us some flexibility there. \n And in terms of the equipment side, we've not heard any issues around our customers delivering the equipment to the sites for installation. Now we read about all the same semiconductor issues that you read about, so I guess that could change, but it has not manifested itself so far. There'll be densification. But just like every generational upgrade, you go first to your existing sites because that's the quickest, the best bang for your buck. So this is happening exactly like it always does. The last part of your question is based on what they would bring to the table and mostly operational context as opposed to capital, at least so far. And in terms of -- there are certainly ones that are off-limits, either by choice or by legal necessity, places like Cuba and China. I mean, we're just not allowed to go there. \n And then there will be others where the analysis of the risks outweigh the rewards. In a country where you have very little rule of law and you have the potential for nationalization of assets, those are not going to be markets where we're most excited about. We look at all kinds of things. And when you get into markets in Africa, most of the work is not around the assets as much as it is around political, regulatory, tax, government. And we spend a lot of time and taking a lot of resources before we make those decisions. It wouldn't show up in our services revenue. The way that, that would -- that would be leasing revenue. I'm just not -- I know we have some interest. I don't know if we've actually booked anything or not. Do you know, Brendan? Brendan, do we have the answer to the last part? Yes. And in terms of the new-builds in Tanzania, we're committed to build hundreds of towers over the next 5 years. The hope is we increase that. \n I would point to South Africa, which we -- which is now, I believe, over 1,500 towers, most of which were built. So there's a lot of opportunity there, and we will continue to press it in those areas where we think it's going to provide great returns. Well, we're looking for towers that, ultimately, either with the first, although that's more unlikely, but with the second get to a 15% cash on investment yield or higher. \n I want to thank everyone for tuning in today. And stay tuned, and we look forward to the next time we're together with third quarter results. Thank you."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good evening. \n SBA had a tremendous quarter with results for the second quarter, ahead of our expectations in most key areas. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $524.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $514.6 million. Foreign exchange rates were ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, contributing $3.1 million of incremental site leasing revenue in the second quarter. They were also a tailwind in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, positively impacting revenues by $3.5 million on a year-over-year basis. \n Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.4% over the second quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.5% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 5.9%. \n Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.5% on a gross basis and 3% on a net basis, including 2.5% of churn. \n Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was up significantly from the prior quarter and represented the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog finished the quarter at a multiyear high. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. \n During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 34% of our domestic bookings with 66% coming from new leases, the first time in many years the bookings from new leases outpaced that from amendments. \n The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 97% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. \n Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.3% net, including 2.2% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. International leasing activity increased modestly from the first quarter. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had an improved quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 8.9% on a constant currency basis. \n During the second quarter, 84.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. \n Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $421.2 million. Our tower cash flow margins continue to be very strong, with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.7% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.8% or 91% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. \n Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $400.2 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. \n During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the company with $51.4 million in revenue and over $11 million of segment operating profit. The very high activity levels we saw in the first quarter strengthened further in the second quarter, resulting in a quarter end services backlog that was 30% above first quarter levels and was also the highest in our company's history. We expect to see continued high levels of services activity throughout the rest of the year, and as a result, have increased our full year outlook for site development revenue by $25 million from last quarter and by $40 million from our initial outlook. \n AFFO in the second quarter was $293.5 million. AFFO per share was $2.64, an increase of 15.3% over the second quarter of 2020. \n During the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 57 communication sites for total cash consideration of $67 million. We also built 98 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or agreed to purchase approximately 400 additional sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $95 million, and we anticipate closing on the majority of the sites under contract by the end of the year. \n In addition, during the second quarter, we announced that through a new joint venture arrangement, we have entered into a contract with Airtel Tanzania, a subsidiary of Airtel Africa, to purchase their approximately 1,400 towers in Tanzania. Under this agreement, Airtel will lease back space on each of the towers and will also provide a fixed minimum number of build-to-suit towers during the first 5 years following the closing of the acquisition. \n The total purchase price for the acquisition is expected to be approximately $175 million, and the acquisition is anticipated to close in stages starting in the fourth quarter. For our updated 2021 outlook, we have assumed that the acquisition closes at the end of the year, and thus, we have included the entire purchase price in our outlook for discretionary capital expenditures, but we have included no revenue or tower cash flow associated with these events. \n We expect the assets to produce approximately $18 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first full year of operations under the joint venture. SBA will be the majority partner of the joint venture, and we are partnering with Paradigm Infrastructure Limited, a U.K. company founded by former senior executives of American Tower, which is focused on developing, owning and operating shared path of wireless infrastructure in selected growth markets. \n We believe the combined international tower industry operating experience of SBA and Paradigm will allow us to maximize the opportunity in this new rapidly growing market. \n In addition to new tower assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.8 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years. \n In this afternoon's earnings press release, we included our updated outlook for full year 2021. Our updated increased expectations for site leasing revenue, site development revenue, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. These increases are driven by outperformance across our business, increased network investment activities by our customers, improved foreign exchange rates, reduced nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures and reduced cash interest expense as a result of timely refinancings. \n Notwithstanding our strong domestic leasing bookings during the second quarter, which were ahead of our expectations, we have not increased our 2021 outlook for incremental organic domestic leasing revenue. New bookings typically begin to accrue revenue at the earlier of a date certain or commencement of construction. For outlook purposes, unless we have received notice of construction commencement, we only consider the date certain, which, for the second quarter bookings outperformance generally ranges from late in the fourth quarter to sometime in the first half of 2022. \n As we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate our reported gross domestic same-tower revenue growth will begin to increase in the second half of the year and that we will exit 2021 at the highest rate of the year. As is always the case, our full-year 2021 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, when opportunities present, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. \n Our outlook for net cash interest expense does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2021. \n Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 111.5 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. \n With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Yes, Ric, to this point, obviously, nothing has been material enough to do that. We do always back out -- we've previously identified when we haven't consolidated something. Obviously, the JV piece of the AFFO per share. But it's something we'll look at. If it becomes material, we'll highlight it for you guys. We just haven't had any, really, to date. Yes. I mean I don't think so, Ric. The things that would drive it up is obviously more augmentation activity of the towers, which is certainly possible, given the increased amount of activity in general that we're seeing. But the offset to that is that as we have longer terms to our leases, particularly the Verizon MLA, which we talked about last quarter, and some of the new agreements that come with longer term, that tends to stretch out the period over which you're amortizing and actually reduces the amount. \n Plus just -- it's a factor of which towers are getting hit, whether work needs to be done at the site, how much cost is being reimbursed, all those kind of things. So I don't expect it to actually move up materially at any point in the next year or 2. Yes, that's the total purchase price, the $175 million plus a few incremental costs. So that represents everything. So it wouldn't be materially more than that. I mean down the road, we'll have to see how things... Yes. The JV, Phil, is specific to Tanzania. There's no obligation to do anything alongside them going forward. So there's no commitment as far as that goes. Yes. Mike, from a growth standpoint, we certainly expect it to be mid- to high single digits in the future given what's going on now. So yes, when you're talking about going out a lot of years, obviously, we're getting bigger and bigger, so you have to add that many more dollars to make that happen. But given the activity levels today, I think as we get a year or so out, you'll start to see us return to levels that are similar to what we've reported in the past when we were busier. Yes. You're talking about the same-tower growth rate, Walt, alright? Yes. Yes. We expect it to step up sequentially each of the next 2 quarters, but certainly, the fourth quarter would be a bigger step-up is our expectation based on the timing of when this -- the stuff we're signing... They're getting stuff activated in Q3 as well. So I mean, it's a mix question, Walt, but they're busy in activating stuff in both -- we expect in both quarters. Yes. It's increasing. I mean, certainly, the lease-up has been a little bit better just recently, and we expect it to be better as we move through the year. I don't know that I would agree with your characterization, though, so we should probably talk about that separately. Batya, on the Sprint churn piece, it's expected -- we had, I think, what we reported last time was about $1.7 million or so in the first quarter. We expect the full year to be somewhere between $8 million, maybe $8 million to $9 million or so for the year, the fourth quarter impact. And this is, again, on a full-year, year-over-year basis. Will be a little bit bigger because, obviously, there are some of those leases that are going away as we move through the year. \n In terms of next year, right now, we still think maybe $30 million to $35 million or so is appropriate. I have to hedge a little bit only because the timing of when we get notice is, what they specifically decided to do, is a little bit of a fluid situation. But based on what we know today and lease expiration dates, that we think that's a reasonable estimate. The purchase price? Are you asking about the purchase price or the leaseback? It's roughly -- well, this includes the other third parties, so I don't know the exact breakdown. But the total leasing revenue that's contracted is about 67% in U.S. dollars, when you exclude the pass-through stuff. I don't believe so. Not yet. I don't have the exact number for you, Brandon. It's materially higher, I can say, generally. But we can actually look for something to maybe put a percentage increase or something on that for you after the call."

At this time, all participant phone line are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. . Just a brief reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2021 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may include our future results or may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 26 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn the call over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you Mark. Good evening. SBA had a solid start to the year with first quarter results ahead of internal expectations for most of our key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $505.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $504.5 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the first quarter. They were however a significant headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $12.6 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.6% over the first quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.4% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.6% on a gross basis and 3.1% on a net basis, including 2.5% churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter was modestly lower sequentially than the prior quarter. But on the heels of our newly signed agreements with Verizon Wireless and Dish, we have seen substantial increases in our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs. These backlog increases are supportive of significant increases in domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 77% of our domestic bookings with 23% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 86% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.1 billion of total debt and $11.9 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.6 times. This leverage ratio is elevated slightly above our target range of 7.0 to 7.5 times due to the PG&E acquisition during the first quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.4 times. On January 29, the company issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2029. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.125% per year and interest is due semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fully redeem all the outstanding 4% senior notes, to pay all premiums and costs associated with such redemption and to repay the amounts outstanding at the time under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. As of today, we have $530 million outstanding under our revolver and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is 3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.3 years. During the first quarter, we repurchased 654,000 shares of our common stock for $160.9 million for an average price of $250.33 per share. All shares repurchased were retired. As of today, we have $475.1 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 30, 2021 were 109.3 million compared to 111.6 million at March 31, 2020, a reduction of 2%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.4 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.58 per share, payable on June 15, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2021. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. As you heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid financial and operating results. Activities in the first quarter provides a foundation for the rest of 2021 and for the next couple of years. During the quarter, each of our largest domestic customers provided public disclosures expanding upon their 5G deployment plans making it clear with upgrades to their existing background network should be a key component of their network investment strategies over the next several years. We have begun to see direct evidence of this with significant growth in our leasing application backlogs and increasing volumes in our services business.\nOperator: . First, we go to the line of John Atkin, RBC. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. So I was interested in whether you have seen any actual equipment installed on your U. S. towers? What kind is it, C-Band or L-Band variety? And then I had a kind of a bigger picture question about escalators which historically have been fixed and we get a lot of questions sometimes about why that could eventually become more CPI-based over time in kind of the core U.S. business? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: So on C-Band type things, I will just speak generically, Jon. Signed leases and amendments, yes, actually installs yet, no. And you shouldn't read anything more into that other than the typical time it takes to go from execution to installation. And on the fixed escalators versus variable, I mean that's an age old question. It obviously depends on which side of the historical inflation you fall as to what you prefer. It's been discussed and in every case that I know of that the U.S. is people have landed on a fixed escalator concept. So I don't know what really to tell you beyond it's a regular topic of discussion and fixed is the way folks have gone.\nJon Atkin: Got it. And then any more color you could provide on Brazil on just kind of macro topics, economy, carrier landscape, sector ?\nJeff Stoops: Brazil is strong still on progress. There is no question, the economy is feeling the effects like labor , employment rate Brazil is now currently around 15%. Our folks are optimistic that better times are shortly ahead. But we will need to see all that. I will say that notwithstanding the overall bleaker environment there, certainly compared to the U.S., our business and our operations continue to do just fine. So we are obviously thankful for that and communications continues to be a key need there and carriers continue to answer that need. But in general, everyone reads the same thing that I do and the same folks that I talk to, they still have some room to go in terms of improving their COVID position.\nJon Atkin: Lastly, just on the PG&E assets. Are there any kind of metrics around a portion of the portfolio that achieve a legitimate quality for lease up? What types of use cases you are finding when people do of these lease application? And just how to kind of think about the growth profile there?\nJeff Stoops: Well, obviously, all the ones that we talked about are in use. We have interest in some of the other 28,000 that are currently not in use. And the demand has been both for amendments by existing customers and new leases. So we are pretty pleased with how things have gone the first couple of months. Justin, I think we are ready for our next question.\nOperator: Next up, we have Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. Just first, just following up on your comments regarding the activity levels, with the Verizon on the book and you have had a couple more months of discussions and activity, is 1Q the trough for domestic organic growth by leasing growth that was reported at 5.6%? And how do you think about what the peak range could be for this metric again, now that you have a couple more months of conversations and agreement? And then just secondly, are there any updates on the possible timing for merger-related churn relating to the T-Mobile and Sprint deal? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. Hi Mike. On the same tower growth rates, Q1 is certainly right around the trough. It's possible that Q2 also would be at a similar level based on what we have got in mind today. A lot, just as a reminder, that metric is a calculation based on the trailing 12-months. So it's really backward-looking and a lot of the significant increases we have seen in the organic leasing activity has just started to happen recently here. And so I expect that it will start to increase in the second half of the year and we will exit the year at a higher rate and frankly continue to increase as we move into next year. As far as how could it be, I can't really say for sure. I think on our previous call, we talked about on a net basis getting to mid single digits. I think that is certainly achievable. A big question mark is the timing of the churn which now leads to your third question, which is about the Sprint and T-Mobile overhang. The numbers that we gave on our previous call are still pretty much the same. We don't have, nothings occurred that would make us change our expectations. Just as a refresher, this year, we have about $8 million or so of impact to 2021 is what we are anticipating. We have already incurred a decent portion of that. So that's probably about the right number for this year. Next year is expected to be a little bit bigger, closer to $30 million of impact next year before it steps down the following couple of years to somewhere around $10 million to $15 million per year. And so we see the biggest impact potentially in 2025 and 2026. Having said all that, that's an estimate based on the timing of when those leases, the overlapping leases come up for their maturity date. It's certainly possible that T-Mobile plans will change in terms of what sites they need to keep. And so we will have to keep eyes on that and we will certainly inform you if anything changes.\nOperator: Next up, we are going to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thanks. Can you help us think about activity ramping from this year to next year as we go from the guided activity and talking about an exit run rate accelerating from here? I just want to pull the churn discussion out and really think about what activity could be doing?\nJeff Stoops: Well, it's clearly going to accelerate, Phil, as the C-Band spectrum is clear. Verizon themselves stated that one of the reasons for the team that was able to get ahead of the actual clearing and have the equipment already in place and ready to go. But I think as a practical matter, there will be a fair amount of just-in-time delivery of new C-Band equipment as it relates to when they get the spectrum cleared. And AT&T's commentary was that much of their C-Band spending is not even going to occur until beginning of 2022. So if you think what our customers have said at face value, we should move through this year and continue to grow as we move through 2022.\nPhil Cusick: And if I were to assume 2019 as a good example of what happens when two carriers are really spending, do you think 2022 activity could be better than that $63 million or something that was in 2019?\nJeff Stoops: I mean it could. We don't want to too far ahead of ourselves but if you take your premise of all four carriers being very, very busy, I think 2022 will be that year.\nPhil Cusick: Yes. Okay. Last thing, the service this quarter, just really strong. Anything that we should think of just sort of like a one-time or not repeatable in the second quarter? Or is that a good new run rate?\nJeff Stoops: I don't know how long to take it out, but there is nothing that we know of today as to why Q2 should be materially different.\nPhil Cusick: Good. Thanks Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Yes.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Your line is open.\nSpencer Kurn: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the deal you struck with Verizon. One of your peers signed a more holistic deal where a certain amount of revenue was contracted annually and you guys didn't. So I was curious, why didn't you take that approach?\nJeff Stoops: We historically have thought it's best for all parties to operate on a more a la carte basis, Spencer. So you are correct. Our straight line only includes the results of the term extensions. It does not include any type of use rights, because that's a different deal. And that's just the way we historically have run the business and like to do things.\nSpencer Kurn: Got it. And If I could just --\nJeff Stoops: I don't know if it's any more complicated than chocolate versus vanilla.\nSpencer Kurn: Well, it's worked out favorably for you in the past. So we will have to see how things shape out. And one follow-up. In your prepared remarks, I think you said that you didn't include any benefit from the increase in your backlog that you saw this quarter because of the uncertainty around the commencement timing. Is it the case that you had already baked in some impact of the C-Band into the guide and the application that you saw this quarter basically met your expectation? Or is it the case that if these sites do commence, it could be incremental to your expectations that you laid out last quarter?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Hi Spencer. It's Brendan. We did certainly expect and included in our original guidance an increasing amount of leasing activity throughout the year. The backlogs are supportive of that. And the big question mark, which we did mention in our prepared remarks, it's just simply the timing of those applications turning into signed agreements and then the next step of the signed agreement getting dates at which the rents would kick in. And so we have got certain assumptions we have made around how that's going to play out. It certainly will be increasing as we move through the rest of the year, but that was already assumed. So to the extent that we are off at all and it is a little bit faster, I guess it could be higher. But I think as we get later in the year, the potential for that to be a material impact is very limited.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRick Prentiss: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon guys.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Hi Rick.\nJeff Stoops: Hi Rick.\nRick Prentiss: We were all surprised with the cash taxes mentioned. How did you get there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: You broke up a little bit. I think you are asking about the change in our cash taxes.\nJeff Stoops: Our cash taxes.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the cash taxes for the balance of the year, it's actually in part due to expected benefits that we have now from the PG&E acquisition in terms of amortization of that asset. That was not I think fully more when we gave the original guidance because that deal actually just closed right before we gave the last guidance. So that's something we are going to benefit from. Any other things that affected it are fairly minor differences in some of our international market. But PG&E was really the biggest difference.\nRick Prentiss: Because when we think longer term, how should we think about cash taxes will move around?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, obviously as a --\nRick Prentiss: I mean, they are going to go up.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. They are certainly going to go up. It's interesting because as a REIT, we obviously have limited federal cash taxes at any point, but there are currently state cash taxes that we do pay because we are not paying our full AFFO out as a dividend. So there is some opportunity to improve on that front. But on the other side, the more impactful thing will be our international taxes, which as we continue to grow in those markets and some of the depreciation shields run off, you will see the cash taxes in the international market decline.\nRick Prentiss: Makes sense. And how should we think about the CBRS opportunity? What's the timing and size available to put capital to work?\nJeff Stoops: The timing is now. The primary interest right now will come from municipalities, private networks. We are actually building some school systems to help bridge the digital divide that are focused on CBRS. And while some of our cable customers are also active, I think in terms of the national wireless carriers, they are going to focus really on the mid-band and use the CBRS stuff really as more of a niche solution for them. So the biggest opportunity is really, for CBRS in particular, are with outside of the national wireless carriers today.\nRick Prentiss: Makes sense. And then have you thought about giving us a table showing Sprint churn as far as colo versus other sites as more of your peers are doing the same?\nJeff Stoops: We haven't thought about it, but we will think about it.\nRick Prentiss: That would be great. All right. Thanks guys. Stay well.\nOperator: Next, we have line of Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is open.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. I think my first question ? How do you think this next big change organically be around maybe into next year or as C-Band becomes more of the mix down the road? And how does the amendment revenue compares to higher earnings? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Batya, you broke up on a lot of that. And I don't think any of the three of us here heard everything you said. Could you try that again?\nBatya Levi: Sure. I was asking that about the amendment revenue mix. I think it was 77% this quarter. How do you think about that trending towards the year-end and maybe with the C-Band deployments becoming a bigger part of the mix? And  average in terms of how do these amendment revenues compare on a monthly basis now versus prior upgrades?\nJeff Stoops: Okay. The 77% and this is purely a guess, but I am going to guess it goes down as we hit year-end, mostly because all the Dish business is going to be new leases. So that's probably going to, to the extent it changes, it will be for that reason, because most of the other activity is from the other three carriers is definitely going to be amendments. And in terms of the pricing, we really never get into that. But I will tell you that based on load and usage basis, the pricing is entirely consistent with what our history has been.\nBatya Levi: Okay. Got it. Maybe one quick follow-up. The new tower purchases 413, can you tell us where they were and how is the M&A activity in those markets?\nJeff Stoops: Those are actually under contract, most of those, Batya and they are mostly located internationally in existing markets of ours.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much. I guess, a few questions. So on the services activity, in the past we have had one or two carriers being the driver of that. I guess how democratically distributed would you describe services activity running ahead of expectations at this stage? I guess the second question was just on this commencement question, Mark and some of the comments that John Stankey made about \"skittishness\" with respect to supply chain. Any observations, Jeff, maybe that you guys have from your perch as to how you see the probability, the confidence interval around accelerating activity give those questions for the same? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. On your last one, well, your first one, it's still not too democratically spread out. Our services revenues are still disproportionately coming from a few actors, which actually is good, because we have the opportunity to expand that base as we move through the year. In terms of your second question, we haven't really seen any supply issues yet, David. That's not to say, if somebody says that they are out there and they are, we haven't seen them yet. And in terms of what it's going to mean for us, as I think we have explained many, many times, once a lease or amendment is executed, when it actually begins to accrue revenue is the earlier of the date certain or when we actually install the equipment. So we are all rooting for fast equipment availability and dates of install that are earlier than the specified the end date in the contract. If that happens, we begin to accrue greater revenue earlier. But I mean right now, as we think about life and how this year and next year is going to play out, we are not really thinking about equipment delays.\nDavid Barden: Okay. Great. And then if I could do one more follow-up. Just in light of the PG&E deal, obviously now that that's kind of ripened and closed, has there been an elevated or any amount of inbounds from other corners of the world looking to kind of do you have done? Or is that more a forced situation that was kind of unique?\nJeff Stoops: Well, PG&E had its own unique needs, but we have had many, frankly, inquiries from other utilities around the country.\nDavid Barden: Okay. Good. Thank you guys.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we have the line of Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nNick Del Deo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, returning to the PG&E sites. If you think back to other assets you have acquired that may not have been adequately marketed, is that's how long would it take them into kind of hit their stride and start seeing the benefits of being plugged into your sales engine? Was it basically right away? Or does it take a little time?\nJeff Stoops: No. It always takes time, always takes time. I mean six months to a year to really get to the point where it's just like a home-grown asset.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one on the M&A front. Obviously, a lot of talk of higher capital gains taxes this year. Would you expect that to potentially increase the pool of towers for sale in the U.S.? Or you are not hearing much on that front?\nJeff Stoops: It has historically, Nick. So I would expect it to do so again. But I don't know that the magnitude will be so great that it will be like a tsunami of deals. But clearly, there will be tax sensitivity, if the capital gains rates are increased.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. So maybe you pick up a few more, but not enough to really change the trajectory or anything?\nJeff Stoops: I wouldn't say we are going to get to 20% portfolio growth off the tax law changes.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you Jeff.\nOperator: Next, we have Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, I think you guys mentioned something on CBRS and kind of digital divide and some benefits there. Could you talk a little more broadly about some of the government push for more rural broadband? And what do you think that might mean overall for your business? And then second, can you just update us on any updated developments on kind of the whole edge compute data center world where we know you guys are kind of kicking the tires right now? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. The government involved in broadband and bringing broadband to more rural areas is right in the middle of that, Tim. The initial bills have been mostly focused on fiber because they are trying to establish a minimum uplink and downlink speed which for fixed wireless today is not available. And there is a tremendous amount of lobbying going on right now to basically free that money for wireless as well as fiber and that all remains to be seen. In addition, the other aspect of the legislation that's been proposed is mostly for CapEx. And we have tried to make it clear, if you are industry channels that surely not CapEx that you need, there's a lot of CapEx out here. If somehow the relief could be structured in a way that guarantees rental payments and OpEx for periods of time, then I think you really have something that's going to be impactful for our industry. So the work that we are doing so far actually has not revolved so much on any federal programs. There is an ERIC program that is for education that is federally administered that's a part of it. But mostly we have been working with county school districts and actually private funding that's interested in economic development to make this stuff happen. So we are excited about the potential. What we have done to-date hasn't really involved much of any federal funding because that cake is still not baked yet. The edge compute, it continues to be a focus of ours. I continue to think it's going to bear a lot of fruit. We actually have two new customers and two new facilities that are under construction since our last call. But what really needs to happen, right and we have been very clear on this, I think from day one is, you need to have a use case world where you need computing power right at the cell site. And we are not there yet. I think we are going to get there. But until we get there, that's when you really want to know that the edge computing opportunity is a good one that we think it's going to be.\nTim Long: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we have Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Your line is open.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Jeff, I wanted to go back to Phil's question. He was drilling on 2022. But do you think 2022 is the peak year for colo and amendments?\nJeff Stoops: I don't know. I mean, we will see. It all depends on how quickly our customers want to spend. . You had AT&T saying, they are not really going to start their C-Band work until 2022. So I mean, it could be, but it also may not be.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. But I think, Phil, had you drilled down pretty nicely and it's $60 million versus $63 million, whatever. So you have good sense where 2022 is and how much of Verizon and now with Dish and stuff like that in there. So I am just curious if you think there's much left over to take that number even higher in 2023?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I would disagree that we know enough now to have 2022 fully baked and compare that to what ultimately will be the full build-out plans for our customers. It's going to be multi-year. It's not just a two-year gig. And it's not even really starting until late this year at the earliest. So the more we talk, the less I am prepared to say 2022 will be the time.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. And then Brendan, I think, when you were talking about, I mean the last two quarters you gave us a good sense of the churn that was ordered out at T-Mobile and Sprint. So I think you reiterated that $8 million-ish number, $9 million-ish whatever. But I think, Brendan, you also mentioned a lot of that has already been loaded in the first quarter. So was it a couple of million in Q1 of that $8million-ish or $9 million that has already kind of hit your numbers?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. It was a little less than $2 million. It was probably about $1.8 million or so. So, it will be a little bit bigger. So yes, I mean we saw a bunch of these releases that ended right at the end of last year, beginning of this year. So that piece we already knew about and then there are some other extra pieces that we are assuming happened that may or may not, but they are relatively small.\nWalter Piecyk: So when you talk about, Brendan, the mid single digit growth, should we think about that including that Sprint number or Sprint Nextel or Nextel, T-Mobile number or is it after that?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Long term, the question I was answering was, what do we think it could get to in terms of being in a growth rate. So yes, that's a net number, but it's all --\nWalter Piecyk: Including Sprint, because obviously that Sprint churns are going to start cranking up?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. But obviously in any given year, it could be higher or lower, because the Sprint churn is lumpy. So depending on the year, some years will be below that. And I guess conceivably it could be higher than that if you had really low churn and high lease up.\nWalter Piecyk: I was just hoping it's like a Dave Schaeffer long term or it's like that number we are always waiting for. And then last question is on the Dish massive or Dish. Are they using massive MIMO antennas in terms of their new lease activity? Or are they using a more traditional approach?\nJeff Stoops: More traditional.\nWalter Piecyk: Got you. Thank you very much.\nJeff Stoops: Sure.\nOperator: Next, we have Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if you don't mind. We are talking a lot about C-Band and the historical conventional wisdom has always been higher frequencies are more useful in dense areas and less useful in less dense areas and your portfolio seems to skew a little more less dense. Now that you actually have insight from some conversations with carriers about how you are thinking about using the C-Band, what level of visibility or confidence do you have that they are actually going to go to all of the towers they currently use with you in markets where they hold C-Band licenses and upgrade and support C-Band? Or do you think there's some towers that won't fit and the other side of it, if you put your optimist hat on is, to what extent do you actually think they are going to increase their density if you begin going outside they maybe historically have not as they see that? And then the second question, if I just sort of think back on some of the earlier questions before, it sounds like you really haven't changed your approach to your leases. You are sitting with fixed escalators. You still like a la carte and there are some emerging operators who have signaled that maybe that has created opportunity for them that they have been able to get into some spaces where maybe you are not winning business because you haven't been as flexible. How have you gone comfortable with that trade-off that as you went through this vast iteration of major negotiations? It doesn't seem like you really budged a lot.\nJeff Stoops: Well, I would put out our historical results as the reason why we are comfortable with that and our first quarter results and where we will be this year and where we will be next year and kind of leave it at that. In terms of your first question on density, I think we have seen enough so far to know that it's going to be fairly broad. I mean I would never tell you to count on 100% of their release. But it is going to be broad. It's going to be closer to a 100% than it is to 50%. And we won't really know, I think, until we get into it a little bit, particularly with the existing carriers as to how much new leasing will come about this because clearly they are all pursuing colocations first because that's faster, cheaper, it's just a smart way to go about it. And it will be a little bit of time before we see the demand for new leases. But it would be like anything else. I mean if the demand is good enough and there's money to be made, they are going to collocate.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEric Luebchow: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that last point. You mentioned in the Verizon deal, there were some parameters around new site builds. And it seems like recently the big three wireless carriers haven't done as much with the public towerco's on new builds. So do you see an opportunity beyond just the initial amendment activity for new sites, either with Verizon or any of the other carriers? Or is it just too early to tell at this point?\nJeff Stoops: No, we definitely see an opportunity and this agreement will facilitate that.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great. And then just one more for me. I am just wondering in the initial discussions with the C-Band winners, your large customers, have you have seen any amendment opportunity beyond the C-Band radios, perhaps then looking at lower frequency spectrum upgrades to support uplink to allow them to get better propagation out of the mid-band spectrum?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean there is a variety of requests and equipment contents that go about this. It's not just strictly C-Band radios. A big part of this is the massive MIMO antennas. That's different than what your question was, but we are seeing a whole variety of different things here, of which really the unleashing of the C-Band has now given everybody the reason to go back to the macro networks that they knew was coming. So here we are.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Hi. Great. Thank you. I appreciate with the Verizon MLA that there is not a use case. I am curious in deals like that, if you put in place some type of an incentive to potentially go on to X amount of their sites faster than otherwise and if, for example, they do that they get pricing lower than they might otherwise. I am just curious if there is those types of structures and deals? And then secondly --\nJeff Stoops: Yes. We do have an incentive, Colby. And you say deals like this. I mean this is the first global master agreement we have ever done for Verizon.\nColby Synesael: Okay. But I guess, to your point, there is an incentive that if they go into X amount of sites by X amount of date, it would be more cost effective on a per site basis than if they took longer?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. X amount, X price, X date equals X discount.\nColby Synesael: Got it. And then secondly, Brendan, I am curious if there's any more refi opportunities? Obviously, that was nice savings. And then lastly, I am just curious what drove the AFFO beat? I think that's where in terms of revenue, EBITDA, AFFO, that's where we saw the biggest beat and if I just take your first quarter number and annualize that, that already gets me to the midpoint of your 2021 guidance. Just curious if there's anything one-time in there? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Hi Colby. So refi opportunities, there definitely are opportunities without doubt. We have some debt that is reaching points where it can be refinanced. And based on the current market environment, we would expect to be able to refinance it at better rates than we are currently paying on several of those instruments. So I would just say, stay tuned since we are constantly looking at that and I would expect us to take advantage of those opportunities. On the AFFO beat, I think you are referring to, basically, our increase in our outlook for, in addition to the beat. But yes, I mean, I guess they are one-timers in some sense. One of the main contributors was in the services area, which we already talked about. We actually had a very strong quarter. So the margin contribution from services was very high. That's not a recurring business. So I guess you could call it one-time. But we do expect to continue to see a similar level of activity throughout the year based on the backlog that we have. We also --\nColby Synesael: And then get to that point I just, sorry and I guess I think Phil Cusick asked this, but are you seeing a similar margin profile for that as well?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes.\nColby Synesael: Okay.\nBrendan Cavanagh: We are. And that is subject to shift a little bit depending on the mix side type work versus construction. Construction is typically a little bit lower margin. But as of right now, most of the work that's happening is a lot of it's pre-construction. So I would expect that to stay similar. And as we get toward the latter part of the year, you would probably start to see more construction work and so maybe the margin starts to shift down slightly at that point.\nJeff Stoops: So the projects have much higher volume.\nBrendan Cavanagh: They have higher volumes. That's right. And then, other contributions on AFFO, it was a couple of different things. We obviously had a little bit better cash taxes which we talked about on an earlier question. We also had lower non-discretionary CapEx than we had expected. We even lowered our guidance for the full year slightly for that as well. So it's a mix of each of those things. And frankly on the per share number, the share buyback helped a little bit as well in reducing our share count. So a mix of all those things.\nColby Synesael: Okay. And I mean I guess the point that I was at, when I look at your taking that number, I already got to the midpoint of your guidance. So it would seem that number should be going up through the course of the year.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean some of it's timing related. I mean we did do well in the first quarter in certain areas like the CapEx and frankly even our SG&A costs that we expect to be, both of those items to be a little bit higher as we move through the year. So some of it's just the timing issue. But overall, we were able to improve our full year guidance, in part because of the performance in the first quarter.\nColby Synesael: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Two questions. Jeff, a question for you. Can you quantify the year-over-year change in the backlog of signed but not commenced new leases? And I guess when was the last time backlogs were this high? And the second question was around the minimum commitment that you would have with Dish. How do the minimum commitments trend throughout the life of the contract? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: While they do have certain time periods, which we are not going to disclose. So there's X business by Y day. And so it's broken out in more discrete periods over the contract. So there is definitely incentives and commitments to move things along during the life of the lease. In terms of the dollar volume on the backlogs, we generally internally talk about backlogs in terms of the number of amendments and the number of leases. And where we are today versus where we were a year ago, which is, remember, we hadn't even got to the T-Mobile, Sprint and maybe we just got to the finish line right about now. I mean they are more than twice the size, but it's a different time.\nBrandon Nispel: And I guess, when was the last time that backlogs was this high?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It's been a few years.\nJeff Stoops: It's been a number of years.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean we have had periods. Obviously when you go back to the LTE upgrade, they were high. They probably were higher than they are now, although we are still building and that may very well be eclipsed in future here. But if you go back a couple of years ago when T-Mobile was particularly active, we saw some higher levels. But we are definitely at a high level by historical standards, even if it's not the highest and it's continuing to build, which is the most --\nJeff Stoops: Of recent times, yes. The LTE, the one thing we have made clear before is backlog from 3G to 4G, the average amendment prices was much higher, due to the heavy equipment nodes that were being added. We certainly expect volumes to rise with that. But pricing will be a little bit different this time within the less heavy additional weight loads that would be in question as part of the upgrades.\nBrandon Nispel: Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next will come from David Guarino, Green Street. Your line is open.\nDavid Guarino: Hi. Thanks guys. A question for you on data center. So since the start of the year, we have seen a pickup in the number of transactions. Have you guys evaluated any other acquisition since the one last done in Jacksonville? And I guess what's the company's appetite to grow the data center footprint?\nJeff Stoops: We have a greater appetite, provided that it comes along with edge deployments at our cell sites. So as that continues to grow and as we continue to demonstrate the synergy between a regional data center and the MEC centers at our tower sites, which is what we are beginning to now experience in Jacksonville in particular, we would continue to look. We are very mindful of what we are though. We are wireless infrastructure company. And these regional data centers, if any, would be pursued only because of the success or the perceived success we will be having around the cell sites.\nDavid Guarino: That's helpful. And is that just in the U.S. you would be looking? Or can we see you guys look internationally as well?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. The concept applies everywhere.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the final question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam of Deutsche. Your line is open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you give any more color in terms of the latest you are seeing from Dish and when we should anticipate them to maybe become a more meaningful driver for cash site leasing revenue growth in upcoming quarters? And then one housekeeping item, maybe for Brandon. If you can give us the contribution from a revenue and a tower cash flow perspective for PG&E in 1Q? And should we effectively double that into 2Q, given the full quarter? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Brendan?\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the PG&E one, I believe the contribution was somewhere between $4 million and $5 million of tower cash flow and only slightly higher on the revenue side, because the costs are very limited there. And you should pretty much double that, because it closed pretty close to the middle of the quarter.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And on Dish, Matt, a lot of signed leases times 10 for application. So tremendous amount of activity. But whether we see revenue out of that this year will depend solely on how quickly Dish goes through the site acquisition, permitting and construction phase of things. And I can't give you anymore guestimate than what I have said because that's what it would be. That's what's going to drive revenue recognition this year, is the pace of the installs for Dish. But I mean it's all moving in the right direction.\nMatthew Niknam: Understood. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. Thank you and thanks everyone for joining us. We think it's going to be a great year and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the presentation for this afternoon. We thank you for all your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. As you heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid financial and operating results. Activities in the first quarter provides a foundation for the rest of 2021 and for the next couple of years. During the quarter, each of our largest domestic customers provided public disclosures expanding upon their 5G deployment plans making it clear with upgrades to their existing background network should be a key component of their network investment strategies over the next several years. We have begun to see direct evidence of this with significant growth in our leasing application backlogs and increasing volumes in our services business. So on C-Band type things, I will just speak generically, Jon. Signed leases and amendments, yes, actually installs yet, no. And you shouldn't read anything more into that other than the typical time it takes to go from execution to installation. And on the fixed escalators versus variable, I mean that's an age old question. It obviously depends on which side of the historical inflation you fall as to what you prefer. It's been discussed and in every case that I know of that the U.S. is people have landed on a fixed escalator concept. So I don't know what really to tell you beyond it's a regular topic of discussion and fixed is the way folks have gone. Brazil is strong still on progress. There is no question, the economy is feeling the effects like labor , employment rate Brazil is now currently around 15%. Our folks are optimistic that better times are shortly ahead. But we will need to see all that. I will say that notwithstanding the overall bleaker environment there, certainly compared to the U.S., our business and our operations continue to do just fine. So we are obviously thankful for that and communications continues to be a key need there and carriers continue to answer that need. But in general, everyone reads the same thing that I do and the same folks that I talk to, they still have some room to go in terms of improving their COVID position. Well, obviously, all the ones that we talked about are in use. We have interest in some of the other 28,000 that are currently not in use. And the demand has been both for amendments by existing customers and new leases. So we are pretty pleased with how things have gone the first couple of months. Justin, I think we are ready for our next question. Yes. Hi Mike. On the same tower growth rates, Q1 is certainly right around the trough. It's possible that Q2 also would be at a similar level based on what we have got in mind today. A lot, just as a reminder, that metric is a calculation based on the trailing 12-months. So it's really backward-looking and a lot of the significant increases we have seen in the organic leasing activity has just started to happen recently here. And so I expect that it will start to increase in the second half of the year and we will exit the year at a higher rate and frankly continue to increase as we move into next year. As far as how could it be, I can't really say for sure. I think on our previous call, we talked about on a net basis getting to mid single digits. I think that is certainly achievable. A big question mark is the timing of the churn which now leads to your third question, which is about the Sprint and T-Mobile overhang. The numbers that we gave on our previous call are still pretty much the same. We don't have, nothings occurred that would make us change our expectations. Just as a refresher, this year, we have about $8 million or so of impact to 2021 is what we are anticipating. We have already incurred a decent portion of that. So that's probably about the right number for this year. Next year is expected to be a little bit bigger, closer to $30 million of impact next year before it steps down the following couple of years to somewhere around $10 million to $15 million per year. And so we see the biggest impact potentially in 2025 and 2026. Having said all that, that's an estimate based on the timing of when those leases, the overlapping leases come up for their maturity date. It's certainly possible that T-Mobile plans will change in terms of what sites they need to keep. And so we will have to keep eyes on that and we will certainly inform you if anything changes. Well, it's clearly going to accelerate, Phil, as the C-Band spectrum is clear. Verizon themselves stated that one of the reasons for the team that was able to get ahead of the actual clearing and have the equipment already in place and ready to go. But I think as a practical matter, there will be a fair amount of just-in-time delivery of new C-Band equipment as it relates to when they get the spectrum cleared. And AT&T's commentary was that much of their C-Band spending is not even going to occur until beginning of 2022. So if you think what our customers have said at face value, we should move through this year and continue to grow as we move through 2022. I mean it could. We don't want to too far ahead of ourselves but if you take your premise of all four carriers being very, very busy, I think 2022 will be that year. I don't know how long to take it out, but there is nothing that we know of today as to why Q2 should be materially different. Yes. We historically have thought it's best for all parties to operate on a more a la carte basis, Spencer. So you are correct. Our straight line only includes the results of the term extensions. It does not include any type of use rights, because that's a different deal. And that's just the way we historically have run the business and like to do things. I don't know if it's any more complicated than chocolate versus vanilla. Hi Rick. Our cash taxes. The timing is now. The primary interest right now will come from municipalities, private networks. We are actually building some school systems to help bridge the digital divide that are focused on CBRS. And while some of our cable customers are also active, I think in terms of the national wireless carriers, they are going to focus really on the mid-band and use the CBRS stuff really as more of a niche solution for them. So the biggest opportunity is really, for CBRS in particular, are with outside of the national wireless carriers today. We haven't thought about it, but we will think about it. Batya, you broke up on a lot of that. And I don't think any of the three of us here heard everything you said. Could you try that again? Okay. The 77% and this is purely a guess, but I am going to guess it goes down as we hit year-end, mostly because all the Dish business is going to be new leases. So that's probably going to, to the extent it changes, it will be for that reason, because most of the other activity is from the other three carriers is definitely going to be amendments. And in terms of the pricing, we really never get into that. But I will tell you that based on load and usage basis, the pricing is entirely consistent with what our history has been. Those are actually under contract, most of those, Batya and they are mostly located internationally in existing markets of ours. Yes. On your last one, well, your first one, it's still not too democratically spread out. Our services revenues are still disproportionately coming from a few actors, which actually is good, because we have the opportunity to expand that base as we move through the year. In terms of your second question, we haven't really seen any supply issues yet, David. That's not to say, if somebody says that they are out there and they are, we haven't seen them yet. And in terms of what it's going to mean for us, as I think we have explained many, many times, once a lease or amendment is executed, when it actually begins to accrue revenue is the earlier of the date certain or when we actually install the equipment. So we are all rooting for fast equipment availability and dates of install that are earlier than the specified the end date in the contract. If that happens, we begin to accrue greater revenue earlier. But I mean right now, as we think about life and how this year and next year is going to play out, we are not really thinking about equipment delays. Well, PG&E had its own unique needs, but we have had many, frankly, inquiries from other utilities around the country. Thanks. No. It always takes time, always takes time. I mean six months to a year to really get to the point where it's just like a home-grown asset. It has historically, Nick. So I would expect it to do so again. But I don't know that the magnitude will be so great that it will be like a tsunami of deals. But clearly, there will be tax sensitivity, if the capital gains rates are increased. I wouldn't say we are going to get to 20% portfolio growth off the tax law changes. Yes. The government involved in broadband and bringing broadband to more rural areas is right in the middle of that, Tim. The initial bills have been mostly focused on fiber because they are trying to establish a minimum uplink and downlink speed which for fixed wireless today is not available. And there is a tremendous amount of lobbying going on right now to basically free that money for wireless as well as fiber and that all remains to be seen. In addition, the other aspect of the legislation that's been proposed is mostly for CapEx. And we have tried to make it clear, if you are industry channels that surely not CapEx that you need, there's a lot of CapEx out here. If somehow the relief could be structured in a way that guarantees rental payments and OpEx for periods of time, then I think you really have something that's going to be impactful for our industry. So the work that we are doing so far actually has not revolved so much on any federal programs. There is an ERIC program that is for education that is federally administered that's a part of it. But mostly we have been working with county school districts and actually private funding that's interested in economic development to make this stuff happen. So we are excited about the potential. What we have done to-date hasn't really involved much of any federal funding because that cake is still not baked yet. The edge compute, it continues to be a focus of ours. I continue to think it's going to bear a lot of fruit. We actually have two new customers and two new facilities that are under construction since our last call. But what really needs to happen, right and we have been very clear on this, I think from day one is, you need to have a use case world where you need computing power right at the cell site. And we are not there yet. I think we are going to get there. But until we get there, that's when you really want to know that the edge computing opportunity is a good one that we think it's going to be. I don't know. I mean, we will see. It all depends on how quickly our customers want to spend. . You had AT&T saying, they are not really going to start their C-Band work until 2022. So I mean, it could be, but it also may not be. Yes. I would disagree that we know enough now to have 2022 fully baked and compare that to what ultimately will be the full build-out plans for our customers. It's going to be multi-year. It's not just a two-year gig. And it's not even really starting until late this year at the earliest. So the more we talk, the less I am prepared to say 2022 will be the time. More traditional. Sure. Well, I would put out our historical results as the reason why we are comfortable with that and our first quarter results and where we will be this year and where we will be next year and kind of leave it at that. In terms of your first question on density, I think we have seen enough so far to know that it's going to be fairly broad. I mean I would never tell you to count on 100% of their release. But it is going to be broad. It's going to be closer to a 100% than it is to 50%. And we won't really know, I think, until we get into it a little bit, particularly with the existing carriers as to how much new leasing will come about this because clearly they are all pursuing colocations first because that's faster, cheaper, it's just a smart way to go about it. And it will be a little bit of time before we see the demand for new leases. But it would be like anything else. I mean if the demand is good enough and there's money to be made, they are going to collocate. No, we definitely see an opportunity and this agreement will facilitate that. Yes. I mean there is a variety of requests and equipment contents that go about this. It's not just strictly C-Band radios. A big part of this is the massive MIMO antennas. That's different than what your question was, but we are seeing a whole variety of different things here, of which really the unleashing of the C-Band has now given everybody the reason to go back to the macro networks that they knew was coming. So here we are. Yes. We do have an incentive, Colby. And you say deals like this. I mean this is the first global master agreement we have ever done for Verizon. Yes. X amount, X price, X date equals X discount. So the projects have much higher volume. While they do have certain time periods, which we are not going to disclose. So there's X business by Y day. And so it's broken out in more discrete periods over the contract. So there is definitely incentives and commitments to move things along during the life of the lease. In terms of the dollar volume on the backlogs, we generally internally talk about backlogs in terms of the number of amendments and the number of leases. And where we are today versus where we were a year ago, which is, remember, we hadn't even got to the T-Mobile, Sprint and maybe we just got to the finish line right about now. I mean they are more than twice the size, but it's a different time. It's been a number of years. Of recent times, yes. The LTE, the one thing we have made clear before is backlog from 3G to 4G, the average amendment prices was much higher, due to the heavy equipment nodes that were being added. We certainly expect volumes to rise with that. But pricing will be a little bit different this time within the less heavy additional weight loads that would be in question as part of the upgrades. Yes. We have time for one more question. We have a greater appetite, provided that it comes along with edge deployments at our cell sites. So as that continues to grow and as we continue to demonstrate the synergy between a regional data center and the MEC centers at our tower sites, which is what we are beginning to now experience in Jacksonville in particular, we would continue to look. We are very mindful of what we are though. We are wireless infrastructure company. And these regional data centers, if any, would be pursued only because of the success or the perceived success we will be having around the cell sites. Yes. The concept applies everywhere. Brendan? Yes. And on Dish, Matt, a lot of signed leases times 10 for application. So tremendous amount of activity. But whether we see revenue out of that this year will depend solely on how quickly Dish goes through the site acquisition, permitting and construction phase of things. And I can't give you anymore guestimate than what I have said because that's what it would be. That's what's going to drive revenue recognition this year, is the pace of the installs for Dish. But I mean it's all moving in the right direction. Yes. Thank you and thanks everyone for joining us. We think it's going to be a great year and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you Mark. Good evening. SBA had a solid start to the year with first quarter results ahead of internal expectations for most of our key financial metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $505.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $504.5 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the first quarter. They were however a significant headwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $12.6 million on a year-over-year basis. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.6% over the first quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.4% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 6%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.6% on a gross basis and 3.1% on a net basis, including 2.5% churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter was modestly lower sequentially than the prior quarter. But on the heels of our newly signed agreements with Verizon Wireless and Dish, we have seen substantial increases in our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs. These backlog increases are supportive of significant increases in domestic operational leasing activity throughout the balance of this year. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 77% of our domestic bookings with 23% coming from new leases. The big three carriers represented 86% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Yes. Hi Spencer. It's Brendan. We did certainly expect and included in our original guidance an increasing amount of leasing activity throughout the year. The backlogs are supportive of that. And the big question mark, which we did mention in our prepared remarks, it's just simply the timing of those applications turning into signed agreements and then the next step of the signed agreement getting dates at which the rents would kick in. And so we have got certain assumptions we have made around how that's going to play out. It certainly will be increasing as we move through the rest of the year, but that was already assumed. So to the extent that we are off at all and it is a little bit faster, I guess it could be higher. But I think as we get later in the year, the potential for that to be a material impact is very limited. Hi Rick. You broke up a little bit. I think you are asking about the change in our cash taxes. Yes. So the cash taxes for the balance of the year, it's actually in part due to expected benefits that we have now from the PG&E acquisition in terms of amortization of that asset. That was not I think fully more when we gave the original guidance because that deal actually just closed right before we gave the last guidance. So that's something we are going to benefit from. Any other things that affected it are fairly minor differences in some of our international market. But PG&E was really the biggest difference. Well, obviously as a -- Yes. They are certainly going to go up. It's interesting because as a REIT, we obviously have limited federal cash taxes at any point, but there are currently state cash taxes that we do pay because we are not paying our full AFFO out as a dividend. So there is some opportunity to improve on that front. But on the other side, the more impactful thing will be our international taxes, which as we continue to grow in those markets and some of the depreciation shields run off, you will see the cash taxes in the international market decline. Yes. It was a little less than $2 million. It was probably about $1.8 million or so. So, it will be a little bit bigger. So yes, I mean we saw a bunch of these releases that ended right at the end of last year, beginning of this year. So that piece we already knew about and then there are some other extra pieces that we are assuming happened that may or may not, but they are relatively small. Yes. Long term, the question I was answering was, what do we think it could get to in terms of being in a growth rate. So yes, that's a net number, but it's all -- Yes. But obviously in any given year, it could be higher or lower, because the Sprint churn is lumpy. So depending on the year, some years will be below that. And I guess conceivably it could be higher than that if you had really low churn and high lease up. Yes. Hi Colby. So refi opportunities, there definitely are opportunities without doubt. We have some debt that is reaching points where it can be refinanced. And based on the current market environment, we would expect to be able to refinance it at better rates than we are currently paying on several of those instruments. So I would just say, stay tuned since we are constantly looking at that and I would expect us to take advantage of those opportunities. On the AFFO beat, I think you are referring to, basically, our increase in our outlook for, in addition to the beat. But yes, I mean, I guess they are one-timers in some sense. One of the main contributors was in the services area, which we already talked about. We actually had a very strong quarter. So the margin contribution from services was very high. That's not a recurring business. So I guess you could call it one-time. But we do expect to continue to see a similar level of activity throughout the year based on the backlog that we have. We also -- Yes. We are. And that is subject to shift a little bit depending on the mix side type work versus construction. Construction is typically a little bit lower margin. But as of right now, most of the work that's happening is a lot of it's pre-construction. So I would expect that to stay similar. And as we get toward the latter part of the year, you would probably start to see more construction work and so maybe the margin starts to shift down slightly at that point. They have higher volumes. That's right. And then, other contributions on AFFO, it was a couple of different things. We obviously had a little bit better cash taxes which we talked about on an earlier question. We also had lower non-discretionary CapEx than we had expected. We even lowered our guidance for the full year slightly for that as well. So it's a mix of each of those things. And frankly on the per share number, the share buyback helped a little bit as well in reducing our share count. So a mix of all those things. Yes. I mean some of it's timing related. I mean we did do well in the first quarter in certain areas like the CapEx and frankly even our SG&A costs that we expect to be, both of those items to be a little bit higher as we move through the year. So some of it's just the timing issue. But overall, we were able to improve our full year guidance, in part because of the performance in the first quarter. It's been a few years. Yes. I mean we have had periods. Obviously when you go back to the LTE upgrade, they were high. They probably were higher than they are now, although we are still building and that may very well be eclipsed in future here. But if you go back a couple of years ago when T-Mobile was particularly active, we saw some higher levels. But we are definitely at a high level by historical standards, even if it's not the highest and it's continuing to build, which is the most -- On the PG&E one, I believe the contribution was somewhere between $4 million and $5 million of tower cash flow and only slightly higher on the revenue side, because the costs are very limited there. And you should pretty much double that, because it closed pretty close to the middle of the quarter."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 21 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We finished up an outstanding 2022 with another very strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2022 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $609.6 million and cash site leasing revenues were $600.5 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $800,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a benefit of $2.2 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.1% net over the fourth quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 9.3%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis, including 3.5% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was not as strong as the third quarter, but still solid. We saw meaningful and balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. Full year organic leasing contributions to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our outlook provided on our prior earnings call. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity and new leases each represented 50% of our domestic bookings. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we again experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. We still expect to incur this churn and have incorporated our reduced 2022 domestic churn amount into our outlook for 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 7.6% of churn or 13% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again with similar results to our strong third quarter. 2022 was one of the strongest years in the company\u2019s history for international gross leasing activity or bookings. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contribution from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to the third quarter and as anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due primarily carrier consolidations and Digicel\u2019s previously announced exit from Panama. During the fourth quarter, 78.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $485.9 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.4% or 90.9%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $460.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.1% in the quarter, again, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues and pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.1%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business had another very strong quarter, with $76.5 million in revenue and $19.3 million of segment operating profit. We finished 2022 with our most successful services year in company history as measured by both revenue and profit by a very wide margin. Services backlogs remain very healthy at year end, although off the record high hit earlier in 2022. Our fourth quarter services results were again primarily driven by T-Mobile and Verizon. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the fourth quarter, was $340.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.12, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021. AFFO results finished ahead of our prior outlook, but were still negatively impacted relative to our outlook assumptions by our early refinancing of $640 million of secured tower revenue securities in November at a higher interest rate than the retired debt. During the fourth quarter, we meaningfully expanded our portfolio acquiring 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, which included 2,632 sites acquired from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for approximately $725 million. During the quarter, we also built 162 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 31 sites all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $23.2 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years. The land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon\u2019s earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2023. Our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth across our leasing business, including an increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments largely due to the strong new leasing activity we experienced during 2022. We also forecast significant revenue growth contributions from non-organic additions, primarily as a result of having the assets acquired from GTS in Brazil in our results for a full year in 2023. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2023. Domestically, the increase is mainly in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning, some of which we had previously expected in 2022. Due to the timing shifts of some of these decommissionings, including during the fourth quarter, we are now including an estimate of $25 million to $30 million of Sprint-related churn in our full year outlook. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. Internationally, our outlook includes increased churn as well, including carryover impacts from Digicel in Panama and carrier consolidations in Central America. In addition, our international churn includes approximately $10 million associated with an agreement we have entered into TIM Brazil, to address their consolidation of a portion of Oi Wireless. This agreement has accelerated certain turn impacts with us in exchange for longer-term business commitments from TIM, and we believe positions us well for a long, mutually beneficial relationship with TIM. Our 2023 outlook does not include any other churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation. But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to this that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. With regard to our Services business, our full year 2023 outlook reflects the year-over-year decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA contribution but starts ahead of where our 2022 outlook started. If not for the phenomenal 2022 services results, our outlook for 2023 would represent the best year for services in our company\u2019s history. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to have very healthy services backlog. And as a result, we expect another very strong year for this business. The outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and also does not assume any share repurchases. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2023, but it does assume we deploy excess cash into repayments of our outstanding revolver balance. Under this assumption, we would end the year with leverage in the mid 6x area, but we project that we would still incur approximately $36 million of increased net cash interest expense compared to 2022. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $109.6 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited about 2023. Our customers remain active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to take just a moment to discuss the succession plan announced this afternoon. I\u2019m truly honored to have been entrusted with the leadership of this tremendous company. I\u2019ve had the privilege of spending the last 25 years at SBA and spending all of those years working closely with Jeff as the company has grown significantly under his leadership. Jeff has been a great friend and mentor to me and I look forward to continuing to have his counsel as Chairman of the Board. I\u2019m very excited about the future of SBA. We have an amazing business that is part of a great and still growing industry. Our financial strength and very talented leadership team position us well to be a critical support to our customers and to capitalize on many future opportunities. I greatly look forward to working with the rest of the SBA team to continue rewarding shareholders and building upon the company\u2019s great legacy. With that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on the balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of total debt and $12.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, which is below the low end of our target range, notwithstanding our significant Brazilian GTS acquisition during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 4.7x. During the fourth quarter, the company through an existing trust issued $850 million of secured tower revenue securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028 and a final maturity date of November 9, 2052. The fixed interest rate on these securities is 6.599%. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the entire $640 million principal amount of our 2018 1C tower securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of March 2023 as well as to pay certain amounts outstanding under the company\u2019s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to quarter end, we continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $585 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.0%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital to repay amounts outstanding under revolver as a result of the GTS acquisition. We currently have $504 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company\u2019s shares outstanding at December 31, 2022, were 108 million compared to 109 million at December 31, 2021, a reduction of 0.9%. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on March 24, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong end to one of the best operational years in our history. For the full year 2022, we beat the midpoint of our original full year guidance for revenue by almost 8% for AFFO per share by 5%. We grew our tower portfolio by over 15%, including entering into a new market in Tanzania, which has gone very well. We had a very strong year for lease-up, including one of the best ever internationally. Our Services business had its best year ever, beating the midpoint of our original outlook for services revenue by 46%, and we grew and expanded our relationships with our largest customers worldwide, setting us up for a bright future. During the fourth quarter, our domestic same tower leasing revenue growth was the highest of the year. All of our largest U.S. customers remain busy during the quarter with relatively balanced contributions from each of them as they continued adding equipment to sites in support of the deployment of new spectrum bands. As evidenced by our full year 2023 outlook, we expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again this year, and we expect all of our largest customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment during 2023, although perhaps at levels slightly below the peak periods of activity we experienced in 2022. Each of the largest U.S. carriers still have significant remaining network needs. So we are confident we will see solid activity on our domestic power portfolio for years to come. Internationally, we ended the year with another very strong organic leasing quarter. During the fourth quarter, 60% of new business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 40% gain through new leases. International leasing activity was ahead of our internal expectations and led by strong contributions from Brazil, South Africa and Tanzania, our largest markets. In 2022, Brazil had, in particular, a very strong year. Lease-up in Brazil for the year was well ahead of internal expectations, and we also had a larger-than-anticipated contribution from CPI-based escalators. We realized material portfolio growth in Brazil, primarily as a result of the GTS acquisition for which the integration is going very smoothly. The foreign exchange rate fluctuations have stabilized over the last year and were actually a slight tailwind to our 2022 results. As Brendan mentioned, we recently entered into an agreement with 1 of the 3 major carriers in Brazil to address Oi consolidation issues in our broader long-term relationship, and we may do something similar with our other major customers in that market. We believe there are great opportunities for future growth in Brazil, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options as the driver. One item we are watching in Brazil is always recent filing for injunctive relief from some of their debt payments. We currently expect that Oi must and will continue to pay their operational vendors, including rents to tower providers. And to date, we have had no collection issues. Our financial exposure to Oi is much reduced given the recent sale of most of their wireless operations to the other 3 mobile carriers in Brazil, with Oi representing approximately 3.5% of our total international revenue. Our sites are critical to the operation of Oi\u2019s network, and we have very long-term leases. As a result, we will likely see a little impact from this latest filing. However, we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely. Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. During the fourth quarter, in order to address the nearing maturity date, we completed a new 5-year ABS offering. And while the interest rate was higher than we would have liked, we were very pleased with the significant level of demand for our offering. We continue to be a preferred issuer with extremely good access to capital. While we have good access to additional debt capital, we will be very thoughtful this year when considering issuing incremental debt in the current rate environment, which would only be done for a compelling use of capital, similar to our Tanzanian GTS acquisitions in 2022. With completion of this refinancing, we now do not have any debt maturities until October of 2024. We finished the year with 93% of our debt fixed, keeping us largely insulated for the time being from significant interest rate fluctuations. Even with the GTS acquisition, we ended the year with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range. The strength of our operations and balance sheet and the steady growth in our cash flow allowed us to once again announce an increase of nearly 20% in our quarterly dividend. This increased dividend still represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO and our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments. The strength of our business and capital structure was recently recognized by the rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s. Since our third quarter earnings release, S&P increased our corporate rating to BB+, only one notch below investment grade. While a good development, we do not, however, have a specific goal of being an investment-grade company. Should we continue to use AFFO to pay down our revolver and reduce leverage, that would be a tactical choice to generate a guaranteed return to the higher interest rate environment compared to other uses of capital and not a change in our long-term views on the use of leverage. We would be building capacity and biding our time for the next opportunity to issue incremental debt at more attractive rates. We believe the stability and financial strength we offer provides shareholders strong opportunities for additional value creation. I want to end on our succession news. The Board and I have been working on succession planning for several years. We appropriately considered the pros and cons of an external search versus the appointment of an internal candidate as our next CEO. Brendan has, for many years, been growing as the leading internal candidate to be our next CEO with increasing internal and external responsibilities. We are confident we have made the right call. Brendan is an extremely talented executive, equally adept with internal and our external matters, strategy and shareholder value creation. His knowledge of SBA and our industry are without equal. He\u2019s well known and respected in the investment community. SBA has an extremely bright future in his hands, and I get to remain very involved and invested in that as the future Chairman of the Board. So a little bit about my decision. It\u2019s been very difficult, as you can imagine, given my love for involvement with SBA for more than 25 years. But the reasons are very simple. I turned 65 this year. And I\u2019ve reached a point in life where I want to do some things while I still can, but I can\u2019t do while running SBA full time. Things like spending more time with family, a growing number of grandchildren, travel, spending more time at our home in South Carolina and charity work, very basic reasons that I believe we all consider at various times in our life. With these things vying for my time and attention, it became clear that now is the right time to turn over leadership to Brendan and the next generation of our exceptional leaders. As you can see from our fourth quarter results and full year 2023 outlook, I am retiring at a time when SBA\u2019s financial help and prospects are extremely strong. I want to thank all of you on this call or otherwise that have played a role in SBA\u2019s success over the years. We have accomplished a lot, and it certainly has taken the work of many. I consider myself extremely fortunate have had the opportunity to lead such a talented group of individuals as we have at SBA, and to have been able to interact and build relationships with a much larger group of customers, constituents, friends, business partners and others who have all contributed to our success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks, Jess. First, Jeff, congrats. Grandbabies are fine. I know you\u2019re going to have fun with them as I am and Brendan, looking forward to working with you in your new role.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Rick.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Rick.\nRic Prentiss: You bet. Two questions, if I could. First, as you think about carrier spending for wireless, obviously, they need to make sure there is revenue and demand out there, what do you all think are the most exciting 5G applications that are coming? And when do customers actually start to get what 5G means? So that\u2019s the first question.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I think that is the seminal question, Rick. And I think, to be honest with you, I can\u2019t name a 5G application that exists today that is kind of in the got to have category. And I think that\u2019s what the whole ecosystem of wireless is waiting on. And when that happens, and I believe it\u2019s a question of when, not if, you\u2019re going to see a heightened sense of needing to invest and make sure that the competition doesn\u2019t get too far ahead. But until that comes along, I think it\u2019s sensible for our customers, particularly ones that have some promises to the Street on free cash flow and things like that, I think, to moderate. And based on all the commentary and what we heard from Ericsson yesterday, I mean that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nRic Prentiss: And then more boring question for the second one. How should we think about the site leasing revenue growth pacing into the years in kind of the front-end loaded versus rear-end loaded. And it looked like that have a couple of major revenue items for other, $12 million in the U.S. and $8 million for international. So maybe unpack that a little bit about what those are.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Ric. So the pacing this year, we would expect will be higher growth in the first half of the year with a slight step down in the second half of the year. That obviously is dependent somewhat on how leasing activity goes in terms of signing up new business here in the first half of the year. But the first half is pretty much locked in for the most part based on the success of the leasing activity we saw at the end of last year. I mean your second part you were breaking up just a little bit. I think you were asking about the other on international. Is that...\nRic Prentiss: And U.S., it was like $12 million U.S., $8 million international. What should we think those are?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So it\u2019s a variety of things. In the case of international, there are some increases to pass-through expenses, which is the main driver. And then in the U.S., it\u2019s a mixed bag. There is some other, what we kind of call, cash basis revenue that we\u2019ve assumed will come in the first half. So it\u2019s things like that. That\u2019s really just our estimate of the year-over-year change as opposed to an absolute change as the business gets a little bit bigger, those things tend to grow.\nRic Prentiss: Again, congrats, Jeff, and enjoy the time of the grandbabies.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Ric.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, congratulations to both of you, Jeff and Brendan. Well deserved.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Phil.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: I wonder if we could just talk about the sort of pace that you assume of either acceleration or deceleration among your carrier customers this year. It seems like through last year, you were sort of looking for somebody to pick up. And maybe they haven\u2019t yet, while others sort of expectation will be slowing down this year. What kind of visibility do you have today?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, we\u2019ve got decent visibility. As I just mentioned to Ric, generally, we expect things to be declining in terms of the growth rate from the first half of the year into the second half of the year. The mix varies by carriers. We had a couple of carriers that were extremely busy last year. We expect them to still be busy this year, but perhaps not at the same pace. So I think that\u2019s probably the main driver, those that are picking up and will really just be dependent on the timing of when we see that accelerate. So I think if you look at last year and you look at the pace at which it increased throughout the year, it\u2019s probably a little bit more of a modest decline this year than it was an increase last year.\nJeff Stoops: We still see several or more than one, let\u2019s say, picking up. And really, it\u2019s just the delta between what decelerates versus what accelerates. But they are not all moving, I think. As you know, they are not all equal in terms of their build-outs and what they have accomplished. So the ones that are furthest ahead are likely to have more on the deceleration side, and the ones that still have a long way to go will be accelerating.\nPhil Cusick: Jeff, we\u2019ve mentioned a few years in the past where you\u2019ve been pretty cautious to build in that acceleration in your guidance until you see the orders coming through. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re fairly cautious on that acceleration in the current guide?\nJeff Stoops: In the aggregate, yes, with respect to certain individual U.S. carriers, I mean we know that there will be some acceleration in 2023. But again, the guide is to the aggregate, not just an individual carrier.\nPhil Cusick: Thank you. And then if I can, one more, just how do you think about the math on buybacks now, right? Last quarter, you made clear that borrowing money at the current rates and buying stock where it was then just didn\u2019t make a lot of sense in terms of accretion. I thought your comment today about sort of waiting for better opportunities was interesting. Do you think that either the private markets are going to start coming around given where rates are? Or do you anticipate that the sort of ratio between the current stock price and the current borrowing rates will change?\nJeff Stoops: Well, with the revolver, you have a guaranteed return 6%, right, to pay that back. And the corollary to that is a 16x, at least on today\u2019s AFFO accretion, a 16x acquisition or stock repurchase. We\u2019re always going to be stock repurchases, Phil, and it\u2019s really a question of picking the right time against the right cost of debt capital and that may \u2013 there may be very well opportunities to do that this year and we will do that. In terms of acquisitions, I do think the market is starting to narrow the gap a little bit, but there is still a gap. And if we see opportunities like we did Tanzania or GTS, we will take a hard look. But we\u2019re very financially-driven. And something we will have to look better, short, long, medium term than repaying our revolver. I mean we do think that interest rates will come down over time. We are going to be betting on the side of the Fed that they reduce inflation to 2% over time, and we know what effect that will have on interest rates. And when that plays itself out, we will have put ourselves in a great position to access incremental debt at prices that will be much more accretive to what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re happy to do that and wait for that time.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Okay, thank you. Congratulations again.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you. Good evening, and congrats to you, Jeff and Brendan. On leverage, I think you\u2019ve noted a couple of times, 6.9%, below the target leverage level. So it sounds like even though you referenced perhaps getting to mid-6s, there is really no change despite the rate environment in your long-term target of 7% to 7.5%. Just wanted to clarify that? And then one of your peers noted on their earnings call in January that they are only seeing the big three carriers adding mid-band spectrum to about half of the towers in their portfolio. It would be great if you could just comment on what you\u2019re seeing with your activity from those companies?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. You\u2019re \u2013 what you said about how we\u2019re thinking about leverage is absolutely correct, Simon. This is a period of time that we\u2019re tactically steering \u2013 and we may not. We may see an acquisition tomorrow that looks much better than paying down the revolver at 6%. And if we do, that\u2019s what we will do. But if we don\u2019t, the natural result of the cash flows that we generate will be deleveraging, but it will only be temporary until such time as we believe incremental debt at the prices then available will create additional value, and that\u2019s what we will do.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And then on the carriers adding mid-band only half the sites, I can\u2019t speak to what the others are talking about. I think it\u2019s our belief and expectation that they will add it to the vast majority of their sites. That comment may have been related to where they are today, which parity. And there is still a long way to go, I think, is the overarching message here. A lot of our sites have not been touched yet. But based on backlogs and communications with our customers, we expect that, that will come over the coming years.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And actually, if you\u2019re speaking today, Simon, we actually think that we\u2019re a little bit less than that on the aggregate for all three. So there is a lot of work left to be done. But it ties into the question Ric asked me first that is the \u2013 what is going to cause the carriers to really spend everything this year to get there, and I think we have to see the killer 3G app that is going to provide the impetus to do that. I said 3G app, 5G app.\nSimon Flannery: Right. So this is probably not a year where you necessarily will hit that 5% to 10% portfolio growth. You were strong last year. But if the opportunity is there, you\u2019ll do it, but you\u2019re not going to just do it to keep up that sort of target.\nJeff Stoops: No, no. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last 10 years on that metric of portfolio growth, I think we\u2019re north of 10%. So it\u2019s not every year necessarily. This may not be the year that we do that, but we did 15% last year. So I think overall, our views around portfolio growth and leverage have not changed.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Greg Williams with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just echoing the congrats to Jeff and Brendan. Just wanted to revisit the M&A landscape question. I mean there seems to be two camps on where multiples are headed in the private assets. One is \u2013 some believe private capital is going to \u2013 that\u2019s on the sideline is eventually going to dry up and private multiples could come down a bit. The other camp, the scarcity of assets, especially U.S. assets and the tower multiples should stay elevated. It sounds like you\u2019re waiting for rates to come down so the multiples will stay higher. I\u2019m just curious to hear your thoughts on those views. Second question is just on service margins. I mean your service revenue is coming down understandably from record levels. But how should we think about the type of service activity and the margins year-over-year? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Well, I mean rates versus multiples. If you look at any kind of traditional economic analysis, there should be a relationship between one and the other. We didn\u2019t see a lot of that over the last couple of years. As rates have gone up, multiples really did not drop the way they should have had, at least using our math. That\u2019s starting to change a little bit, and we will have to see. We will have to see whether the amount of private capital on the sidelines will long-term push returns down in the acquisition market across the board. We\u2019re not prepared to invest with those returns. We\u2019ve got higher goals, and we pick and choose. And so far, I think we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with the capital we\u2019ve invested versus the return that we\u2019re seeking, but I think it remains to be seen.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And then Greg, on your services margin question, our outlook assumes a slightly lower margin for services work this year, and that\u2019s based on primarily just a slight shift mix \u2013 sorry, shift in the mix of whether it\u2019s construction or site act type of work. So the construction stuff is usually a little bit lower margin, also a mix on the type of work and who we\u2019re doing the work for has some impact. But from a big picture standpoint, it\u2019s a fairly small drop from what we had last year, and we will see how it shakes out. If it ends up being the same, we will have slightly better results than we projected.\nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: For the first question, I\u2019ll preface this by saying that I realize it hasn\u2019t even been 2 hours since you\u2019ve given the full year 2023 guidance. But a question that keeps coming up is if the second half of 2023 in the U.S. business decelerates, what does that mean for growth in 2024? And Jeff, I realized you made some comments both in the release and on today\u2019s call about some of those prospects. But just wondering if you could put more color on how you\u2019d like investors to feel about this multiyear transition and leasing opportunity, if you could put some guardrails around it. And then just secondly, if you can give us an update on what the build-to-suit opportunities might look like more broadly over the next few years. And is there a way to accelerate that program to get greater portfolio growth?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think the way we think about leasing, Michael, is there is a lot of work left to be done on our assets domestically and internationally to deploy 5G, multiple years\u2019 worth of work. But ultimately, whether \u2013 how far that goes and at what pace will depend on how much and how fast carriers want to spend money. So we \u2013 it\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to occur. It\u2019s just a question of when and at what pace. But the physical work that is yet to be done is tremendous. There is just a lot left to be done. Now I guess you could take the \u2013 because if you were a naysayer, you could take the position that, well, they are just never going to deploy all that spectrum that they spend all that money on, but that seems to be a bit forward. So, those are the guardrails that we are looking at. And right now, and this could certainly change based on pickups in activity, that we are going to have a very strong 2023, where the first half is weighted more heavily than the back half. And in terms of build-to-suits, we are pushing that business line, both in the U.S. and internationally. We continued to be financially-driven in the investments that we make in that area. So, not every build-to-suit is necessarily, at least in our view, an appropriate return on capital. But we are going to seek out and try and take all the ones that we think do fit those goals.\nMichael Rollins: And just a curiosity, where are year one returns for the build-to-suit program?\nJeff Stoops: We are looking for 9%, 10%, 11% cash-on-cash returns, and that\u2019s not every opportunity that\u2019s out there.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And that\u2019s a multiyear. Year one will obviously vary depending on the specific situation. And frankly, Mike, that is the analysis around new build opportunities is not that different than it is for M&A, where a lot of these opportunities are competitively bid like the M&A deals are. They are just competitively bid with typically with carriers handing out those opportunities. So, we do our best when we are able to find strategic opportunities to build, but the volume there is obviously less. On the build-to-suit opportunities, we are making a financial decision. So, we would certainly like to continue to boost our portfolio numbers, but it\u2019s all about the financial returns, and so we will be selective there just like we are on the M&A market.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And I will just echo everyone else\u2019s congrats both, Jeff and Brendan. Two questions. One, the SG&A looked a little higher than we thought. I wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s a step-up related to some of the assets you acquired in the quarter, if maybe there is any inflationary pressures that are flowing through the P&L that we need to be thoughtful about as we model out next year or this year. And then you pointed out that the dividend payout is still a very low percentage of your AFFO. I am just wondering where are you in terms of the payout relative to your taxable income? And do you anticipate that the payout is going to be able to remain at a relatively low portion of your AFFO, or could something on the tax component of that change quickly over the next few years? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Just so on the \u2013 I will do the dividend one first. We have pretty significant NOL still. I believe the number is somewhere around $585 million of NOLs as of the end of the year. So, that gives us a decent runway, and we should be able to keep our percentage of AFFO at a manageable level. And although it will grow certainly each year, if we continue to grow our dividend at the same pace we have been, I still think we have got many, many years left based on how we model it out. On the SG&A side, going forward, we did include certain bigger increases in our outlook that are largely around inflationary-type costs. Most of our SG&A is people-related costs. And on average, we are giving bigger increases to people this year than we have in past years. Just cost of living is increasing, and also to be competitive in the marketplaces that we are in. So, it\u2019s mostly that, there is nothing in particular, I think to call out on it otherwise.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. But I would echo you ought not assume that that\u2019s going to be the same pace of increase over a multiyear period, Brett. Thanks.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions and Jeff and Brendan, again, I also want to echo the other\u2019s comments and congratulate both of you on the upcoming changes. I guess first, you noted in your prepared remarks that revenue placed under contract in Q4 wasn\u2019t quite as strong as in Q3 and your backlogs have ticked down a bit. Are these changes of the magnitude you consider kind of typical in the course of business and to be expected? And can you share anything about what you have seen year-to-date in \u201823 along those lines?\nJeff Stoops: I mean they are clearly part of the cycle of wireless deployments over the last 20 years, Nick. We actually \u2013 we are looking at charts \u2013 internal charts today about the pace of activities on a quarterly basis, and this period of time really was some \u2013 one of the longest that we have seen going back to before the 3G to 4G upgrades. So, it\u2019s not unusual. And deep down, there is two things that our customers really care about. Are they losing ground because there is some kind of great competitive pressure coming from somewhere, and what\u2019s their free cash flow, and what did they promise the investment community. And what I think is going on now is simply a balance of that. But I would steer people to the comments we made earlier about this being a temporal thing because the physical amount of work yet to be done to bring 5G, at least to our assets, there is still a lot left.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And then I also wanted to drill down a little bit into the agreement you reached with TIM. I think you said there would be about $10 million in churn from that in 2023. Does that take care of all of your expected Oi churn from TIM. Are there any benefits to SBA aside from the term extension? And just think about Oi more generally. I think in the past, you said you expected about $20 million to $30 million in total churn. With this deal done, should we assume, call it, $10 million to $20 million from the other acquirers, or are you now able to tighten that up some?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. First, yes. This would account for all of the Oi consolidation-related churn with TIM. There should not be any more based on the agreement that we struck. The total remaining would be \u2013 in the ballpark, I would say that it\u2019s a little bit higher because of the GTS acquisition if you recall. So, I would call it 23% to 33% is \u2013 I am sorry, that\u2019s a total $23 million to $33 million, minus the $10 million. So, yes, I mean I think we are \u2013 we will see where things go with the other carriers down there as we have conversations. So, those are to be seen, but for TIM, this would be it. Nick?\nNick Del Deo: Yes, sorry. And then aside from the term extension, nothing else to consider from our side of the deal?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean there are some other things. There are some other business commitments that are part of the agreement as well, and there is a variety of smaller things. But the main gist of this is some accelerated discount to their leases, long-term commitments across the entire portfolio, including non-Oi related agreements and some future business commitments.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi everyone. This is Alex on for Dave. First off, I just want to send our congratulations to you both Jeff and Brendan. Maybe just first on the international new leasing just flat year-over-year, does the expected cadence for that, should that \u2013 should we see that kind of ramp up through the year and exiting 2023? And then I know you just kind of touched on some of the carrier dynamics in Brazil. Could you maybe just touch on the spectrum auction as well as the recent presidential election last year? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. The international leasing revenue cadence should be fairly balanced throughout the year. Unlike in the U.S., when we talked about a decline, that\u2019s really U.S.-related. Internationally, we would expect it to be pretty steady throughout the year. And then on the other \u2013 I am sorry, the other carriers in the 5G auctions. Yes, I mean we are \u2013 those auctions have put spectrum into the hands of these carriers. With the consolidation now of Oi, it\u2019s going to \u2013 we believe it\u2019s going to actually be positive long-term. Once they kind of get beyond these synergies, there is some work to be done here in this first year or 2 years post merger. But I think as they get beyond that in order to compete as we believe they will now much more on network quality and 5G services, we expect that to be a big driver of leasing growth going forward. And just as it happens here in the U.S. and in other markets, the need to put that spectrum to work is the only way to get that investment to pay off. So, we believe there is a lot of opportunity longer term now in Brazil as a result.\nJeff Stoops: And in terms of the political landscape, Lula obviously took the presidency, but the Bolsonaro group took the rest of Congress. So, you have what you have similar to the United States, which is a split Congress. And when that typically happens, it\u2019s the same that occurs here, which is it\u2019s very hard to get anything done there materially. And that ultimately, I think endures to the benefit of existing businesses. So, we don\u2019t \u2013 in the current landscape, where you have that kind of a split representation, we don\u2019t anticipate anything material coming out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thank you And congrats to Jeff and Brendan on the new developments. There was a lot of questions on M&A. Maybe you could discuss potential new markets and give us an update on the Philippines and Tanzania. And then secondly, Brendan, if I heard you correctly, there weren\u2019t any collections issues related to Oi, but accounts receivable did tick up about $67 million quarter-over-quarter. Maybe you could provide some color what\u2019s behind that. Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the last one, the tick-up is really actually just a timing issue in terms of collections because of the year-end. It\u2019s as simple as where the holidays fall and where payments were made, plus there were some services-related AR that we expect will actually come down over time.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. In terms of M&A, I mean we continued to take an opportunistic approach to new markets. We will go into a new market based on our demographic and operational analysis as well as country stability, risk, taxation, currency. So, with certainly some exceptions that we would never look to go into under current circumstances, any country that we are not in today is a potential opportunity. And Tanzania is doing very well. Tanzania is ahead of our internal projections and the modeling that we did at the time of the acquisition. It is a dynamic country that is growing, and we are very optimistic about the future in Tanzania.\nBrendan Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Congrats to both. A couple of questions. First, on the domestic churn, you have been pushing it out throughout the last year or so. Is it truly just timing, or do you think that some of that decommissioning activity that the carrier anticipated is actually not going to pan out, or is it a mixture of both? And to the extent that you see activity from carriers where they support fixed wireless service, have you started to see some incremental amendment activity in that region, or is it too early to tell? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the domestic churn, the timing, which is all Sprint, T-Mobile merger-related is truly just timing. We expect that the total amount that we will incur will be the same as what we have kind of guided to in the past. We just think it takes a little bit longer to get some of that done, but we don\u2019t expect any changes.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And in terms of the fixed wireless, we believe what our customers say that it basically is a product that results from excess capacity that currently exists in the network after at least where they have deployed a lot of mid-band spectrum. That really just works off the existing macros bat yet, so we haven\u2019t seen anything that we would clearly and particularly identify as incremental. Although there have been some reports where microwave, millimeter wave spectrum would be broadcast off the macro sites to help with the fixed wireless initiative. We hope that comes to pass, obviously, but we haven\u2019t seen that happen just yet.\nBatya Levi: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Brendan, a question for you, the guidance for leasing, I am afraid I am going to ask this just a different way than everybody else has it. But the guidance for leasing for $72 million, you exited at about $21 million this quarter on my numbers. So, it seems to imply an exit rate in \u201823 of $15 million to $16 million. I guess is that right? And then as we think about building our forecast for \u201824 if you are exiting around that level, historically, you guys have grown new leasing by the $40 million to $50 million cap. What would be the swing factors in terms of keeping that $15 million to $16 million exit rate holding steady in \u201824 versus maybe trending lower? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. That\u2019s in the right ballpark, Brandon, in terms of where we would think that we will exit that sort of what\u2019s assumed in our $72 million number. That is in that range. What would swing it in terms of what happens after that is really dependent on what happens in terms of new bookings signed up during the second half of this year, the pace of that. If it\u2019s ahead of our pace, it\u2019s not going to have much impact on our assumed pace, it\u2019s not going to have much impact on 2023, but obviously, it will drive what happens in 2024. So, it\u2019s a little early to be able to talk about that, obviously, but the biggest impact is going to be based on what\u2019s happening in terms of new business we are signing up the second half of this year.\nBrandon Nispel: I guess just a follow-up on that. Two of your larger customers have sort of guided us to lower capital spending in \u201823 and \u201824. So, I am curious what would drive the leasing number to ever be better than $72 million. Do we need to see another spectrum auction? Is there going to be another sort of massive ground of densification of the existing spectrum bands? Is it a new customer? It\u2019s going to be a new 5G use case, just trying to get a sense of sort of your thoughts around 5G more holistically in that regard.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think that it\u2019s really a function of how many of our customers are hitting on all cylinders at the same time. It\u2019s usually just concentration more than it is anything else. Our biggest lease-up periods throughout our history have come when all of our customers have been busy at the same time. Usually, that\u2019s the biggest driver. If you have them do it over time, it just basically spreads it out more, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily change the total. So, that\u2019s probably the biggest answer. I mean obviously, there are other things that are out there that are more specific. I mean DISH has certain obligations in 2025. That of course, could be a driver to activity levels with them. T-Mobile\u2019s got C-band spectrum that\u2019s clearing at the end of this year as well as 3.45. They haven\u2019t really deployed any of that. So, there is a variety of specific things that you could point to by carrier that could be drivers of accelerated activity at a given point in time, but that\u2019s really to be seen in terms of the timing. Ultimately, though we expect all of those things to drive incremental business to our site, it\u2019s just a question of when that happens.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And I would just add, and this comment goes throughout all the comments. We have been careful with our guidance and with our commentary not to get ahead of our customers. I mean ultimately, the answer to your question is how much money they decide that they are going to \u2013 we are not going to change the amount of money they are going to spend. They are going to spend what they decided they need to spend under the current competitive capital and other dynamics.\nBrandon Nispel: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hey. Thanks. Two questions on your guidance. I will ask on both upfront. The first one on the escalation guidance for your international markets, I was wondering if you could just comment on why given the higher CPI last year, why are we \u2013 we are seeing flat growth in that number year-over-year? And then on your discretionary CapEx guidance, I am assuming there is no acquisitions included in there, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be up pretty significantly versus last year. Is that some data center investments, or is there any other type of CapEx that\u2019s driving that higher in \u201823? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So, on the international escalations, the dollar amount is flat. The CPI was certainly elevated during 2022. We are projecting it to be lower in Brazil, which is by far, our largest international market in 2023. But it\u2019s \u2013 while it\u2019s lower next year, the timing of when those escalations take place has an impact. So, some of the higher escalations of \u201822, some of that benefit carries over into 2023, and our assumed lower rate obviously then offset some of that benefit. Plus, we have a little bit bigger base of business, of course, with the GTS acquisition in particular. So, when you put it all together, we ended up with basically about the same dollar amount of growth impact, but we are assuming that the CPI rates come down year-over-year. So, that\u2019s offsetting what you might otherwise see as an increase. And on the discretionary CapEx, there is a small amount of contracted M&A in there, which we actually disclosed how much is under contract in our press release. But the balance of that is made up of assumptions we have made around new builds, around data center upgrades, around some DAS networks that we are investing in, basically everything else. The only thing that we don\u2019t include in there is an assumption around M&A because it\u2019s obviously lumpier and hard to identify what that\u2019s going to be sitting here today. But the rest of our discretionary investment plans, the guidance kind of reflects those assumptions.\nDavid Guarino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no other questions in queue. I will turn the conference back over to you.\nJeff Stoops: Thank you, Eric. And thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to advising you on our progress in 2023 as we move through the year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong end to one of the best operational years in our history. For the full year 2022, we beat the midpoint of our original full year guidance for revenue by almost 8% for AFFO per share by 5%. We grew our tower portfolio by over 15%, including entering into a new market in Tanzania, which has gone very well. We had a very strong year for lease-up, including one of the best ever internationally. Our Services business had its best year ever, beating the midpoint of our original outlook for services revenue by 46%, and we grew and expanded our relationships with our largest customers worldwide, setting us up for a bright future. During the fourth quarter, our domestic same tower leasing revenue growth was the highest of the year. All of our largest U.S. customers remain busy during the quarter with relatively balanced contributions from each of them as they continued adding equipment to sites in support of the deployment of new spectrum bands. As evidenced by our full year 2023 outlook, we expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again this year, and we expect all of our largest customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment during 2023, although perhaps at levels slightly below the peak periods of activity we experienced in 2022. Each of the largest U.S. carriers still have significant remaining network needs. So we are confident we will see solid activity on our domestic power portfolio for years to come. Internationally, we ended the year with another very strong organic leasing quarter. During the fourth quarter, 60% of new business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 40% gain through new leases. International leasing activity was ahead of our internal expectations and led by strong contributions from Brazil, South Africa and Tanzania, our largest markets. In 2022, Brazil had, in particular, a very strong year. Lease-up in Brazil for the year was well ahead of internal expectations, and we also had a larger-than-anticipated contribution from CPI-based escalators. We realized material portfolio growth in Brazil, primarily as a result of the GTS acquisition for which the integration is going very smoothly. The foreign exchange rate fluctuations have stabilized over the last year and were actually a slight tailwind to our 2022 results. As Brendan mentioned, we recently entered into an agreement with 1 of the 3 major carriers in Brazil to address Oi consolidation issues in our broader long-term relationship, and we may do something similar with our other major customers in that market. We believe there are great opportunities for future growth in Brazil, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options as the driver. One item we are watching in Brazil is always recent filing for injunctive relief from some of their debt payments. We currently expect that Oi must and will continue to pay their operational vendors, including rents to tower providers. And to date, we have had no collection issues. Our financial exposure to Oi is much reduced given the recent sale of most of their wireless operations to the other 3 mobile carriers in Brazil, with Oi representing approximately 3.5% of our total international revenue. Our sites are critical to the operation of Oi's network, and we have very long-term leases. As a result, we will likely see a little impact from this latest filing. However, we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely. Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. During the fourth quarter, in order to address the nearing maturity date, we completed a new 5-year ABS offering. And while the interest rate was higher than we would have liked, we were very pleased with the significant level of demand for our offering. We continue to be a preferred issuer with extremely good access to capital. While we have good access to additional debt capital, we will be very thoughtful this year when considering issuing incremental debt in the current rate environment, which would only be done for a compelling use of capital, similar to our Tanzanian GTS acquisitions in 2022. With completion of this refinancing, we now do not have any debt maturities until October of 2024. We finished the year with 93% of our debt fixed, keeping us largely insulated for the time being from significant interest rate fluctuations. Even with the GTS acquisition, we ended the year with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range. The strength of our operations and balance sheet and the steady growth in our cash flow allowed us to once again announce an increase of nearly 20% in our quarterly dividend. This increased dividend still represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO and our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments. The strength of our business and capital structure was recently recognized by the rating agency Standard & Poor's. Since our third quarter earnings release, S&P increased our corporate rating to BB+, only one notch below investment grade. While a good development, we do not, however, have a specific goal of being an investment-grade company. Should we continue to use AFFO to pay down our revolver and reduce leverage, that would be a tactical choice to generate a guaranteed return to the higher interest rate environment compared to other uses of capital and not a change in our long-term views on the use of leverage. We would be building capacity and biding our time for the next opportunity to issue incremental debt at more attractive rates. We believe the stability and financial strength we offer provides shareholders strong opportunities for additional value creation. I want to end on our succession news. The Board and I have been working on succession planning for several years. We appropriately considered the pros and cons of an external search versus the appointment of an internal candidate as our next CEO. Brendan has, for many years, been growing as the leading internal candidate to be our next CEO with increasing internal and external responsibilities. We are confident we have made the right call. Brendan is an extremely talented executive, equally adept with internal and our external matters, strategy and shareholder value creation. His knowledge of SBA and our industry are without equal. He's well known and respected in the investment community. SBA has an extremely bright future in his hands, and I get to remain very involved and invested in that as the future Chairman of the Board. So a little bit about my decision. It's been very difficult, as you can imagine, given my love for involvement with SBA for more than 25 years. But the reasons are very simple. I turned 65 this year. And I've reached a point in life where I want to do some things while I still can, but I can't do while running SBA full time. Things like spending more time with family, a growing number of grandchildren, travel, spending more time at our home in South Carolina and charity work, very basic reasons that I believe we all consider at various times in our life. With these things vying for my time and attention, it became clear that now is the right time to turn over leadership to Brendan and the next generation of our exceptional leaders. As you can see from our fourth quarter results and full year 2023 outlook, I am retiring at a time when SBA's financial help and prospects are extremely strong. I want to thank all of you on this call or otherwise that have played a role in SBA's success over the years. We have accomplished a lot, and it certainly has taken the work of many. I consider myself extremely fortunate have had the opportunity to lead such a talented group of individuals as we have at SBA, and to have been able to interact and build relationships with a much larger group of customers, constituents, friends, business partners and others who have all contributed to our success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions. Thanks, Rick. Yes, I think that is the seminal question, Rick. And I think, to be honest with you, I can't name a 5G application that exists today that is kind of in the got to have category. And I think that's what the whole ecosystem of wireless is waiting on. And when that happens, and I believe it's a question of when, not if, you're going to see a heightened sense of needing to invest and make sure that the competition doesn't get too far ahead. But until that comes along, I think it's sensible for our customers, particularly ones that have some promises to the Street on free cash flow and things like that, I think, to moderate. And based on all the commentary and what we heard from Ericsson yesterday, I mean that's what's going on. Thanks, Ric. Thanks, Phil. We still see several or more than one, let's say, picking up. And really, it's just the delta between what decelerates versus what accelerates. But they are not all moving, I think. As you know, they are not all equal in terms of their build-outs and what they have accomplished. So the ones that are furthest ahead are likely to have more on the deceleration side, and the ones that still have a long way to go will be accelerating. In the aggregate, yes, with respect to certain individual U.S. carriers, I mean we know that there will be some acceleration in 2023. But again, the guide is to the aggregate, not just an individual carrier. Well, with the revolver, you have a guaranteed return 6%, right, to pay that back. And the corollary to that is a 16x, at least on today's AFFO accretion, a 16x acquisition or stock repurchase. We're always going to be stock repurchases, Phil, and it's really a question of picking the right time against the right cost of debt capital and that may \u2013 there may be very well opportunities to do that this year and we will do that. In terms of acquisitions, I do think the market is starting to narrow the gap a little bit, but there is still a gap. And if we see opportunities like we did Tanzania or GTS, we will take a hard look. But we're very financially-driven. And something we will have to look better, short, long, medium term than repaying our revolver. I mean we do think that interest rates will come down over time. We are going to be betting on the side of the Fed that they reduce inflation to 2% over time, and we know what effect that will have on interest rates. And when that plays itself out, we will have put ourselves in a great position to access incremental debt at prices that will be much more accretive to what we're doing, and we're happy to do that and wait for that time. Thanks. Yes. You're \u2013 what you said about how we're thinking about leverage is absolutely correct, Simon. This is a period of time that we're tactically steering \u2013 and we may not. We may see an acquisition tomorrow that looks much better than paying down the revolver at 6%. And if we do, that's what we will do. But if we don't, the natural result of the cash flows that we generate will be deleveraging, but it will only be temporary until such time as we believe incremental debt at the prices then available will create additional value, and that's what we will do. Yes. And actually, if you're speaking today, Simon, we actually think that we're a little bit less than that on the aggregate for all three. So there is a lot of work left to be done. But it ties into the question Ric asked me first that is the \u2013 what is going to cause the carriers to really spend everything this year to get there, and I think we have to see the killer 3G app that is going to provide the impetus to do that. I said 3G app, 5G app. No, no. And if you look at what we've done over the last 10 years on that metric of portfolio growth, I think we're north of 10%. So it's not every year necessarily. This may not be the year that we do that, but we did 15% last year. So I think overall, our views around portfolio growth and leverage have not changed. Well, I mean rates versus multiples. If you look at any kind of traditional economic analysis, there should be a relationship between one and the other. We didn't see a lot of that over the last couple of years. As rates have gone up, multiples really did not drop the way they should have had, at least using our math. That's starting to change a little bit, and we will have to see. We will have to see whether the amount of private capital on the sidelines will long-term push returns down in the acquisition market across the board. We're not prepared to invest with those returns. We've got higher goals, and we pick and choose. And so far, I think we've been pretty pleased with the capital we've invested versus the return that we're seeking, but I think it remains to be seen. Yes. I think the way we think about leasing, Michael, is there is a lot of work left to be done on our assets domestically and internationally to deploy 5G, multiple years' worth of work. But ultimately, whether \u2013 how far that goes and at what pace will depend on how much and how fast carriers want to spend money. So we \u2013 it's going to \u2013 we're confident it's going to occur. It's just a question of when and at what pace. But the physical work that is yet to be done is tremendous. There is just a lot left to be done. Now I guess you could take the \u2013 because if you were a naysayer, you could take the position that, well, they are just never going to deploy all that spectrum that they spend all that money on, but that seems to be a bit forward. So, those are the guardrails that we are looking at. And right now, and this could certainly change based on pickups in activity, that we are going to have a very strong 2023, where the first half is weighted more heavily than the back half. And in terms of build-to-suits, we are pushing that business line, both in the U.S. and internationally. We continued to be financially-driven in the investments that we make in that area. So, not every build-to-suit is necessarily, at least in our view, an appropriate return on capital. But we are going to seek out and try and take all the ones that we think do fit those goals. We are looking for 9%, 10%, 11% cash-on-cash returns, and that's not every opportunity that's out there. Yes. But I would echo you ought not assume that that's going to be the same pace of increase over a multiyear period, Brett. Thanks. I mean they are clearly part of the cycle of wireless deployments over the last 20 years, Nick. We actually \u2013 we are looking at charts \u2013 internal charts today about the pace of activities on a quarterly basis, and this period of time really was some \u2013 one of the longest that we have seen going back to before the 3G to 4G upgrades. So, it's not unusual. And deep down, there is two things that our customers really care about. Are they losing ground because there is some kind of great competitive pressure coming from somewhere, and what's their free cash flow, and what did they promise the investment community. And what I think is going on now is simply a balance of that. But I would steer people to the comments we made earlier about this being a temporal thing because the physical amount of work yet to be done to bring 5G, at least to our assets, there is still a lot left. And in terms of the political landscape, Lula obviously took the presidency, but the Bolsonaro group took the rest of Congress. So, you have what you have similar to the United States, which is a split Congress. And when that typically happens, it's the same that occurs here, which is it's very hard to get anything done there materially. And that ultimately, I think endures to the benefit of existing businesses. So, we don't \u2013 in the current landscape, where you have that kind of a split representation, we don't anticipate anything material coming out. Yes. In terms of M&A, I mean we continued to take an opportunistic approach to new markets. We will go into a new market based on our demographic and operational analysis as well as country stability, risk, taxation, currency. So, with certainly some exceptions that we would never look to go into under current circumstances, any country that we are not in today is a potential opportunity. And Tanzania is doing very well. Tanzania is ahead of our internal projections and the modeling that we did at the time of the acquisition. It is a dynamic country that is growing, and we are very optimistic about the future in Tanzania. Next question. Yes. And in terms of the fixed wireless, we believe what our customers say that it basically is a product that results from excess capacity that currently exists in the network after at least where they have deployed a lot of mid-band spectrum. That really just works off the existing macros bat yet, so we haven't seen anything that we would clearly and particularly identify as incremental. Although there have been some reports where microwave, millimeter wave spectrum would be broadcast off the macro sites to help with the fixed wireless initiative. We hope that comes to pass, obviously, but we haven't seen that happen just yet. Yes. And I would just add, and this comment goes throughout all the comments. We have been careful with our guidance and with our commentary not to get ahead of our customers. I mean ultimately, the answer to your question is how much money they decide that they are going to \u2013 we are not going to change the amount of money they are going to spend. They are going to spend what they decided they need to spend under the current competitive capital and other dynamics. Thank you, Eric. And thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to advising you on our progress in 2023 as we move through the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We finished up an outstanding 2022 with another very strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2022 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $609.6 million and cash site leasing revenues were $600.5 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $800,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a benefit of $2.2 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.1% net over the fourth quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 9.3%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis, including 3.5% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was not as strong as the third quarter, but still solid. We saw meaningful and balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. Full year organic leasing contributions to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our outlook provided on our prior earnings call. During the fourth quarter, amendment activity and new leases each represented 50% of our domestic bookings. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we again experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. We still expect to incur this churn and have incorporated our reduced 2022 domestic churn amount into our outlook for 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 7.6% of churn or 13% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again with similar results to our strong third quarter. 2022 was one of the strongest years in the company's history for international gross leasing activity or bookings. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contribution from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to the third quarter and as anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due primarily carrier consolidations and Digicel's previously announced exit from Panama. During the fourth quarter, 78.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $485.9 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.4% or 90.9%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $460.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.1% in the quarter, again, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues and pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.1%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our services business had another very strong quarter, with $76.5 million in revenue and $19.3 million of segment operating profit. We finished 2022 with our most successful services year in company history as measured by both revenue and profit by a very wide margin. Services backlogs remain very healthy at year end, although off the record high hit earlier in 2022. Our fourth quarter services results were again primarily driven by T-Mobile and Verizon. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the fourth quarter, was $340.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.12, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021. AFFO results finished ahead of our prior outlook, but were still negatively impacted relative to our outlook assumptions by our early refinancing of $640 million of secured tower revenue securities in November at a higher interest rate than the retired debt. During the fourth quarter, we meaningfully expanded our portfolio acquiring 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, which included 2,632 sites acquired from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for approximately $725 million. During the quarter, we also built 162 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 31 sites all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $23.2 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years. The land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2023. Our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth across our leasing business, including an increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments largely due to the strong new leasing activity we experienced during 2022. We also forecast significant revenue growth contributions from non-organic additions, primarily as a result of having the assets acquired from GTS in Brazil in our results for a full year in 2023. In addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2023. Domestically, the increase is mainly in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning, some of which we had previously expected in 2022. Due to the timing shifts of some of these decommissionings, including during the fourth quarter, we are now including an estimate of $25 million to $30 million of Sprint-related churn in our full year outlook. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. Internationally, our outlook includes increased churn as well, including carryover impacts from Digicel in Panama and carrier consolidations in Central America. In addition, our international churn includes approximately $10 million associated with an agreement we have entered into TIM Brazil, to address their consolidation of a portion of Oi Wireless. This agreement has accelerated certain turn impacts with us in exchange for longer-term business commitments from TIM, and we believe positions us well for a long, mutually beneficial relationship with TIM. Our 2023 outlook does not include any other churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation. But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to this that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. With regard to our Services business, our full year 2023 outlook reflects the year-over-year decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA contribution but starts ahead of where our 2022 outlook started. If not for the phenomenal 2022 services results, our outlook for 2023 would represent the best year for services in our company's history. As I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to have very healthy services backlog. And as a result, we expect another very strong year for this business. The outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and also does not assume any share repurchases. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2023, but it does assume we deploy excess cash into repayments of our outstanding revolver balance. Under this assumption, we would end the year with leverage in the mid 6x area, but we project that we would still incur approximately $36 million of increased net cash interest expense compared to 2022. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $109.6 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited about 2023. Our customers remain active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals. Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to take just a moment to discuss the succession plan announced this afternoon. I'm truly honored to have been entrusted with the leadership of this tremendous company. I've had the privilege of spending the last 25 years at SBA and spending all of those years working closely with Jeff as the company has grown significantly under his leadership. Jeff has been a great friend and mentor to me and I look forward to continuing to have his counsel as Chairman of the Board. I'm very excited about the future of SBA. We have an amazing business that is part of a great and still growing industry. Our financial strength and very talented leadership team position us well to be a critical support to our customers and to capitalize on many future opportunities. I greatly look forward to working with the rest of the SBA team to continue rewarding shareholders and building upon the company's great legacy. With that, I'll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on the balance sheet. Thank you, Rick. Yes, Ric. So the pacing this year, we would expect will be higher growth in the first half of the year with a slight step down in the second half of the year. That obviously is dependent somewhat on how leasing activity goes in terms of signing up new business here in the first half of the year. But the first half is pretty much locked in for the most part based on the success of the leasing activity we saw at the end of last year. I mean your second part you were breaking up just a little bit. I think you were asking about the other on international. Is that... Yes. So it's a variety of things. In the case of international, there are some increases to pass-through expenses, which is the main driver. And then in the U.S., it's a mixed bag. There is some other, what we kind of call, cash basis revenue that we've assumed will come in the first half. So it's things like that. That's really just our estimate of the year-over-year change as opposed to an absolute change as the business gets a little bit bigger, those things tend to grow. Thank you, Phil. Well, we've got decent visibility. As I just mentioned to Ric, generally, we expect things to be declining in terms of the growth rate from the first half of the year into the second half of the year. The mix varies by carriers. We had a couple of carriers that were extremely busy last year. We expect them to still be busy this year, but perhaps not at the same pace. So I think that's probably the main driver, those that are picking up and will really just be dependent on the timing of when we see that accelerate. So I think if you look at last year and you look at the pace at which it increased throughout the year, it's probably a little bit more of a modest decline this year than it was an increase last year. Yes. And then on the carriers adding mid-band only half the sites, I can't speak to what the others are talking about. I think it's our belief and expectation that they will add it to the vast majority of their sites. That comment may have been related to where they are today, which parity. And there is still a long way to go, I think, is the overarching message here. A lot of our sites have not been touched yet. But based on backlogs and communications with our customers, we expect that, that will come over the coming years. And then Greg, on your services margin question, our outlook assumes a slightly lower margin for services work this year, and that's based on primarily just a slight shift mix \u2013 sorry, shift in the mix of whether it's construction or site act type of work. So the construction stuff is usually a little bit lower margin, also a mix on the type of work and who we're doing the work for has some impact. But from a big picture standpoint, it's a fairly small drop from what we had last year, and we will see how it shakes out. If it ends up being the same, we will have slightly better results than we projected. Yes. And that's a multiyear. Year one will obviously vary depending on the specific situation. And frankly, Mike, that is the analysis around new build opportunities is not that different than it is for M&A, where a lot of these opportunities are competitively bid like the M&A deals are. They are just competitively bid with typically with carriers handing out those opportunities. So, we do our best when we are able to find strategic opportunities to build, but the volume there is obviously less. On the build-to-suit opportunities, we are making a financial decision. So, we would certainly like to continue to boost our portfolio numbers, but it's all about the financial returns, and so we will be selective there just like we are on the M&A market. Yes. Just so on the \u2013 I will do the dividend one first. We have pretty significant NOL still. I believe the number is somewhere around $585 million of NOLs as of the end of the year. So, that gives us a decent runway, and we should be able to keep our percentage of AFFO at a manageable level. And although it will grow certainly each year, if we continue to grow our dividend at the same pace we have been, I still think we have got many, many years left based on how we model it out. On the SG&A side, going forward, we did include certain bigger increases in our outlook that are largely around inflationary-type costs. Most of our SG&A is people-related costs. And on average, we are giving bigger increases to people this year than we have in past years. Just cost of living is increasing, and also to be competitive in the marketplaces that we are in. So, it's mostly that, there is nothing in particular, I think to call out on it otherwise. Yes. First, yes. This would account for all of the Oi consolidation-related churn with TIM. There should not be any more based on the agreement that we struck. The total remaining would be \u2013 in the ballpark, I would say that it's a little bit higher because of the GTS acquisition if you recall. So, I would call it 23% to 33% is \u2013 I am sorry, that's a total $23 million to $33 million, minus the $10 million. So, yes, I mean I think we are \u2013 we will see where things go with the other carriers down there as we have conversations. So, those are to be seen, but for TIM, this would be it. Nick? Yes. I mean there are some other things. There are some other business commitments that are part of the agreement as well, and there is a variety of smaller things. But the main gist of this is some accelerated discount to their leases, long-term commitments across the entire portfolio, including non-Oi related agreements and some future business commitments. Yes. The international leasing revenue cadence should be fairly balanced throughout the year. Unlike in the U.S., when we talked about a decline, that's really U.S.-related. Internationally, we would expect it to be pretty steady throughout the year. And then on the other \u2013 I am sorry, the other carriers in the 5G auctions. Yes, I mean we are \u2013 those auctions have put spectrum into the hands of these carriers. With the consolidation now of Oi, it's going to \u2013 we believe it's going to actually be positive long-term. Once they kind of get beyond these synergies, there is some work to be done here in this first year or 2 years post merger. But I think as they get beyond that in order to compete as we believe they will now much more on network quality and 5G services, we expect that to be a big driver of leasing growth going forward. And just as it happens here in the U.S. and in other markets, the need to put that spectrum to work is the only way to get that investment to pay off. So, we believe there is a lot of opportunity longer term now in Brazil as a result. Yes. On the last one, the tick-up is really actually just a timing issue in terms of collections because of the year-end. It's as simple as where the holidays fall and where payments were made, plus there were some services-related AR that we expect will actually come down over time. On the domestic churn, the timing, which is all Sprint, T-Mobile merger-related is truly just timing. We expect that the total amount that we will incur will be the same as what we have kind of guided to in the past. We just think it takes a little bit longer to get some of that done, but we don't expect any changes. Yes. That's in the right ballpark, Brandon, in terms of where we would think that we will exit that sort of what's assumed in our $72 million number. That is in that range. What would swing it in terms of what happens after that is really dependent on what happens in terms of new bookings signed up during the second half of this year, the pace of that. If it's ahead of our pace, it's not going to have much impact on our assumed pace, it's not going to have much impact on 2023, but obviously, it will drive what happens in 2024. So, it's a little early to be able to talk about that, obviously, but the biggest impact is going to be based on what's happening in terms of new business we are signing up the second half of this year. Yes. I think that it's really a function of how many of our customers are hitting on all cylinders at the same time. It's usually just concentration more than it is anything else. Our biggest lease-up periods throughout our history have come when all of our customers have been busy at the same time. Usually, that's the biggest driver. If you have them do it over time, it just basically spreads it out more, but it doesn't necessarily change the total. So, that's probably the biggest answer. I mean obviously, there are other things that are out there that are more specific. I mean DISH has certain obligations in 2025. That of course, could be a driver to activity levels with them. T-Mobile's got C-band spectrum that's clearing at the end of this year as well as 3.45. They haven't really deployed any of that. So, there is a variety of specific things that you could point to by carrier that could be drivers of accelerated activity at a given point in time, but that's really to be seen in terms of the timing. Ultimately, though we expect all of those things to drive incremental business to our site, it's just a question of when that happens. Yes. So, on the international escalations, the dollar amount is flat. The CPI was certainly elevated during 2022. We are projecting it to be lower in Brazil, which is by far, our largest international market in 2023. But it's \u2013 while it's lower next year, the timing of when those escalations take place has an impact. So, some of the higher escalations of \u201822, some of that benefit carries over into 2023, and our assumed lower rate obviously then offset some of that benefit. Plus, we have a little bit bigger base of business, of course, with the GTS acquisition in particular. So, when you put it all together, we ended up with basically about the same dollar amount of growth impact, but we are assuming that the CPI rates come down year-over-year. So, that's offsetting what you might otherwise see as an increase. And on the discretionary CapEx, there is a small amount of contracted M&A in there, which we actually disclosed how much is under contract in our press release. But the balance of that is made up of assumptions we have made around new builds, around data center upgrades, around some DAS networks that we are investing in, basically everything else. The only thing that we don't include in there is an assumption around M&A because it's obviously lumpier and hard to identify what that's going to be sitting here today. But the rest of our discretionary investment plans, the guidance kind of reflects those assumptions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 31 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We continued our very strong 2022 with another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results were well ahead of our internal expectations and have allowed us to again increase our outlook for our full year results. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $587.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $575.6 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but they were a headwind on comparisons to the third quarter of 2021, negatively impacting revenues by $3.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.9% over the third quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 9.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8% on a gross basis and 4.8% on a net basis, including 3.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity, or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter, was very solid again with meaningful contributions from each of our largest customers. The combination of our strong third quarter leasing activity level and faster-than-anticipated commencements of new amendments have allowed us to increase for the second consecutive quarter our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease-up. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 58% of our domestic bookings, with 42% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented over 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we also experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. Our reduced 2022 domestic churn amounts are expected to shift to 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 8.4% of churn or 13.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again as we had our best quarter of the year in terms of new revenue signed up. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contributions from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.6% on a constant currency basis. As anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the quarter due primarily to carrier consolidations and Digicel\u2019s previously announced exit from Panama. During the third quarter, 81.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.2% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $464.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.8% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.3% or 91.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $446.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.3% in the quarter, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.2%. Approximately, 95% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business again produced new record level results, with $88.3 million in revenue and $22.8 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs, finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record third quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong third quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $26 million. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO in the third quarter, was $339.4 million. AFFO per share was $3.10, an increase of 15.1% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 131 communication sites for total cash consideration of $54.9 million. We also built 113 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 11, we closed on the previously announced acquisition from Grupo TorreSur, adding 2,632 sites in Brazil for cash consideration of $725 million. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 34 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $28.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the first \u2013 excuse me, by the end of the first quarter of next year. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Based on results and activities during and subsequent to the third quarter, we have updated our outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics due to outperformance in the third quarter, lower churn expectations as a result of timing and the earlier closing of the GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by higher interest costs and higher estimated cash taxes from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and excited for a strong finish to 2022. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.8x below the low end of our target range. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3x, equaling the last two quarter\u2019s all-time high. Subsequent to quarter end, we used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the GTS acquisition closing. As a result, as of today, we have $995 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 2.9%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The interest rate on 90% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital for the closing of the Brazilian acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchased authorization remaining under our $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The company\u2019s shares outstanding at September 30, 2022 were 108 million compared to 109.5 million at September 30, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.71 a share, payable on December 15, 2022 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 17, 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. As is appropriate on Halloween, we are pleased to present a treat of an earnings report. The third quarter exceeded almost all expectations and benefited from the significant level of wireless deployment activity by our carrier customers. Notwithstanding the broader challenging macroeconomic environment, our business was extremely busy and we were able to again increase our full year outlook across all key metrics. We raised our full year outlook for total revenue by $49 million after raising it by $64 million last quarter. Domestic organic contributions to leasing revenue growth in the third quarter were the highest for the year and our outlook implies an even higher contribution in the fourth quarter. Our services business produced the highest quarterly contribution of revenue and gross profit in our history and we again grew our services backlog. Our rate of return on invested capital was 10.6% for the quarter, the highest in at least 10 years. It really was a remarkable quarter. In the U.S., each of our carrier customers remained busy during the quarter as they have throughout the year, building out their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile was our most active customer during the quarter, continuing their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon, AT&T and DISH were again very active in the quarter, with 5G-related new lease and amendment signings. Site leasing revenue growth from domestic new leases and amendments has been strong this year, growing throughout the course of the year. We expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again next year as well based on the strength of the organic leasing activity during 2022. Internationally, we had our best organic leasing quarter of the year. During the third quarter, we saw more of a shift toward upgrades at existing sites, with 63% of new business signed up in the quarter coming from amendments to existing leases and 37% coming through new leases. International leasing activity was again led by strong contributions from Brazil and South Africa, our two largest markets. Brazil has performed very well this year. Not only has lease-up been above our internal expectations for the year, we have also had larger contributions from CPI-based escalators, while maintaining a relatively stable foreign exchange rate. In addition, we closed on the previously disclosed GTS acquisition of over 2,600 sites earlier in October. The integration of these sites has only recently begun, but is proceeding smoothly and ahead of plan. As a reminder, these sites have 2.1 tenants per tower and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum auctions in Brazil as a driver. These sites do contain some legacy oil leases, but a smaller percentage than the rest of our portfolio. With regard to Oi, we have begun conversations with some of the carriers that are absorbing the Oi wireless business to discuss potential mutually beneficial and efficient arrangements around the integration of these networks. We still anticipate total churn of approximately $20 million to $30 million associated with the Oi merger on our legacy sites plus an additional estimate of approximately $3 million associated with the GTS or Grupo TorreSur sites. These numbers do not include any potential impact to pass-through reimbursements as those items will be neutral to tower cash flow. We also continue to produce revenue from tenancies associated with Oi\u2019s wireline business, which is unaffected by these mergers. We have a strong relationship with our Brazilian customers and look forward to working with them through this process. With respect to our balance sheet due to early refinancings completed over the last few years and some well placed interest rate swaps, we have positioned ourselves well to address more challenging debt markets. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.8x, below our target range at our lowest level in years. And even with our large fourth quarter Brazilian tower acquisition, we expect to be at or below 7.0x at year end. We have only one $640 million debt instrument maturing between now and October of 2024, representing approximately 5% of our debt outstanding. That instrument matures in March of 2023. And while interest rates are certainly higher today, we still have great access to incremental and refinancing debt capital given the strength of our cash flows. We expect to refinance our pending first quarter maturity during the next several months. During periods with an elevated cost of capital and increased interest rates, it is even more imperative to continue our disciplined and opportunistic approach to investing capital. We are fortunate to be in a strong industry, benefiting from the continued growth in wireless, but also having the strength of significant free cash flow generation, largely fixed cost and scaled operations. It is during times like these that we really appreciate the strength of our underlying business. We are very pleased with the third quarter performance. As indicated by our updated outlook, we are also well positioned to finish out 2022 on a high note. We will be providing our initial 2023 outlook on our next quarterly earnings call. But based on this year\u2019s organic leasing activity and the significant network projects ahead of our customers, we anticipate our leasing results to continue to be strong into next year. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, focused on maximizing returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success and we look forward to a strong finish to the year. And with that, Caroline, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Good afternoon. So I was interested in two topics. One is what you might be seeing in terms of seller expectations or just general observations about domestic M&A and what\u2019s going on with TCF multiples? And then secondly, in your conversations with your U.S. customers interested in \u2013 or to what degree infill or densification or cell splitting starting to come up as opposed to overlays, which I think has been driving the majority of the growth ex-DISH so far? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I will take the last one first, Jon. We are still at least with respect to SBA and its assets in the capacity stage and the overlay and the initial deployment of mid-band spectrum. While we fully expect densification to come, capacity for us continues to be the current driver. Now, we take that as a good thing, because that really just lengthens out the extent of the activity timeline for us. In terms of seller expectations, they are changing some. They have not fully reset to the degree that the public company multiples have compressed. What that means for SBA is there will be a lot of things that we take a pass on unless the price is right. We loved what we did in Tanzania. We loved what we did in GTS. There is a lot of things that we passed on because those expect \u2013 there is still a gap in those seller expectations. But they have started to move actually down.\nJon Atkin: And then lastly, just on international M&A and tuck-in opportunities, build-to-suits, what\u2019s your appetite for that at the moment?\nJeff Stoops: We like build-to-suits provided they are the right terms. Tuck-in acquisitions and, for that matter, new markets would all fall into kind of the same comment I made about finding things that are right for us. And we\u2019re only going to do things if we believe that it\u2019s right for us from a price and a growth perspective. And as \u2013 if we do things great, if we don\u2019t, you\u2019ll see what happened in the third quarter, which is that we de-lever pretty quickly until we do see those right capital allocation opportunities.\nJon Atkin: Excellent. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Curious if you could just share a little bit more details of the backlog. And are you still seeing an extended book-to-bill where it\u2019s just taking longer for that backlog to get into the actual revenue numbers? And then separately, on just data centers and Edge opportunities, any updates on how you\u2019re looking at the opportunities? How some of your tests are coming along? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I don\u2019t know. Brendan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve had any changes in the book-to-bill.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Nothing material. I will say that actually, if you noticed on our bridge for domestic contributions from new leases and amendments that we did up that contribution for 2022, it was 66 last quarter and 67 now. And that change is really largely due to a slight acceleration in timing, and that\u2019s mostly around amendments that just kicked in a little bit quicker than we had projected. But it\u2019s a pretty small change relative to the big picture. I don\u2019t think there is been any material move in that you would point out.\nJeff Stoops: And on the Edge business, Mike, we\u2019ve actually seen some great progress, but it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s great from where we started, which was, of course, at zero. But it\u2019s not really material. I would say we probably have either in operation or under construction 30 to 40 of these facilities. And the primary demand for them has been Edge computing and fiber and cable regeneration. But what we found to be the key to success in this area is really the state of and the location of the tower site because where it\u2019s ready to go and it\u2019s close to or on top of existing fiber makes all that much more attractive. So on an absolute basis, yes, we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth. On a financial basis, it\u2019s still, of course, very small. But we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen.\nMichael Rollins: And within that context, is there a base expectation of the value enhancement? So if you look at what these 30 to 40 sites could do from a incremental cash flow, incremental value perspective? Is there a number that we all should be keeping in mind as the opportunity set?\nJeff Stoops: No, because it\u2019s still small. What I will tell you, though, is that we\u2019re really happy with the incremental return on invested capital for these projects. And at its core, that\u2019s what I think you have hired us to do. So we\u2019re very happy with that. And as long as we can make that return on invested capital, albeit small, perhaps for a little while, we\u2019re going to keep doing it.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRic Prentiss: Good afternoon, everybody.\nJeff Stoops: Hey, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: It certainly is not get treats versus tricks tonight. Thanks, Jeff. First question I\u2019d like to get into is, there is been a lot of debate out there. When you look at the U.S. business, it sounds like you have good visibility, so the leading indicator of services business sounds strong with record backlog. But we get the questions of aren\u2019t the carriers trimming CapEx budget if you look at \u201823 versus \u201822? Not a perfect indicator CapEx. Potential for a recession in the U.S., interest rates are high. Does anybody need to go borrow to pay their CapEx? Help us understand how you\u2019re feeling, it sounds quite positive, Jeff, as far as looking exiting \u201822 strong and then looking into \u201823 strong?\nJeff Stoops: Well, keep in mind, because of the nature of the business, where you sign things up today, but you don\u2019t begin to recognize revenue until later that we\u2019re today already shaping next year\u2019s financial results. So that\u2019s a point of confidence. The other thing I would say is that we track to the tower which of our customers have upgraded their mid-band spectrum on our sites. And the number is actually fairly low across the board for us at this point. And our customers will do what they will do. But knowing what this means for them in terms of the amount of the money, frankly, for first of all, that they spend on the spectrum the \u2013 at least as reported, competitive differences between some of them from a spectrum perspective and others, where they are on our towers and the fact that the CapEx numbers that you get from them are extremely broad. We feel next year is going to be pretty good.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Other question. Obviously, you closed Grupo TorreSur. How should we think about the funding for that business in this environment? And as we look into \u201823, how much more interest expense should we be kind of already starting to think about from our side, even though you haven\u2019t given guidance yet, but think about what that headwind might be? And do stock buybacks come back on the radar as we get into this year or early next year?\nJeff Stoops: Well, Grupo TorreSur is funded. I mean, that you say, think about the funding, that\u2019s already funded. That got funded from cash on hand and our revolver. So the next thing we\u2019re looking at is the refinancing of the $640 million ABS instrument in March where we\u2019ve got that teed up, ready to go. I don\u2019t want to speculate too much on the interest increase. There will be, of course, an interest increase. I mean, Brendan, what\u2019s that instrument bearing today?\nBrendan Cavanagh: The one that\u2019s getting paid off is just below 3.5%. So you should expect that, that will be significantly higher.\nJeff Stoops: Well, let\u2019s put a little parameters around that. I mean, we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s going to have a 6 handle on it, right?\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Okay.\nJeff Stoops: But then \u2013 but keep in mind, we\u2019re going to be producing over $1 billion of AFFO. We don\u2019t have another debt instrument due until October of 2024. So we\u2019re going to be in great shape. We\u2019re going to have capital to invest and it\u2019s either going to get \u2013 we\u2019re either going to see value in portfolio acquisitions based on my earlier comments. We may or may not. We are going to be \u2013 continue to be opportunistic around stock repurchases or third and I would say this is somewhat unlikely given the first two, you are going to see a big decline in our leverage ratio.\nRic Prentiss: Okay, that helps a lot. Everybody, stay well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nLandon Park: This is Landon on for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could expand on any specifics domestically from what you\u2019re seeing from Dish or any of the other carriers in terms of where you think they are at in their deployments.\nJeff Stoops: Yes, I don\u2019t want to get too granular. All of the \u2013 well, let\u2019s say, T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T all still have work to do with us based on our analysis of where they are with their mid-band spectrum. Some of those are further ahead than others. And I think the answer to that question has been well reported. And then Dish has really got a lot of business signed up, and their focus right now is getting all that on air to meet the June 2023 requirements, which based on everything we can tell, they are in a very good position to do. And then we expect them to come back and begin to work on the 2025 requirements. So while it\u2019s varied landed in terms of which of those are busiest, and I don\u2019t think they want me actually commenting on that. I will tell you that there is a high level of business from all of them. And they all, at least based on our analysis, still have a lot to work, a lot of work left to do on our portfolio.\nLandon Park: Thanks for that color, Jeff. And then just one follow-up on the Edge deployment commentary, can you maybe describe what these sites look like, the 30 to 40 that are in operation under construction and build costs, size of the facilities? And maybe what percent of your sites do you think are potentially eligible over time to have such deployments?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think they are mostly 6x12 or 10x20-foot shelters that look like the traditional wireless shelter that certain carriers have used historically. They have got air conditioning. They have got a lot of logistics to check temperatures and alarms and things like that. They basically are for racks of equipment, and they start out with two or three rack capacity and can be expanded beyond that. And Brendan, what are we \u2013 what\u2019s our average cost on those?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, it depends on the size and the scale, obviously. Deployment there for something along the lines of what Jeff described, you\u2019re looking at somewhere in the $100,000 range. But if we do a bigger, more fulsome Edge, it compute through data center where it\u2019s a bigger operation, it can be as much as $400,000 or $500,000.\nLandon Park: And how much power do you have \u2013 would you have going to those facilities?\nJeff Stoops: Yes, they are not \u2013 at that size, they are not being sold on a traditional data center power basis. A lot of the uses today are for regeneration of signal for cable and fiber companies. And that\u2019s not really how that\u2019s priced and sold.\nLandon Park: Okay, thanks very much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Jeff, just going back to Rick\u2019s question, can you give us or define what low means in terms of the number of cell sites that mid-band? Are you talking like sub-10%, sub-20% something in the ballpark?\nJeff Stoops: The most populated of the carriers would be in their satisfaction rate on our towers would be in the 50%ish range and others are below that.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. And then Comcast has this radio from Samsung, it does 2.5 and it has low been in there. I guess, first part of the question is, have you had any type of meaningful dialogue with Comcast and Charter about helping them with their offload strategy? But then more importantly, I guess, when that inevitability does happen, if you look at like three scenarios, one where they just said, hey, we have a radio that just does CBRS and the antenna that goes along with that. Scenario two is we\u2019re doing low band and CBRS, so that\u2019s probably a different type of antenna, maybe larger. And then the third alternative is the low band that they have is deeper, meaning like rather than 5 megahertz in Comcast case, they go out, they lease some additional low band and they are using 10 megahertz of spectrum. Would the leases differ between those three scenarios? Because I\u2019ve seen that you recall over the past many years that you would argue that like, hey, when someone put on the spectrum, we get more money. So for a new leaser or a new tenant, would it be the same way where if they came to you with one of those three alternatives that there would be different pricing?\nJeff Stoops: Just based on the nature of the spectrum is being transmitted?\nWalter Piecyk: Yes, and nature.\nJeff Stoops: Probably. Probably not. Probably it\u2019s all going to be based on the way the equipment looks. And based on your description of the third alternative lower band, deeper lower band, I mean, as you\u2019re describing it, I\u2019m envisioning that\u2019s going to be the most intensive on the equipment side. So they would be based on that, Walt, as opposed to the fact that they are transmitting their own. I mean, even though CBRS is shared and not necessarily owned, we wouldn\u2019t differentiate somebody\u2019s use of CBRS versus their use of their own spectrum, I don\u2019t believe. I don\u2019t think we ever have put it that way.\nWalter Piecyk: And has there been any meaningful discussions up to this point?\nJeff Stoops: We are always in discussions with Charter and Comcast. But I would say that those scenarios that you lay out, for my personal opinion, I think they are still somewhat in the future.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yes.\nWalter Piecyk: Yes, understood. Very well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open.\nBatya Levi: Thank you. Can you remind us the overall financial impact of the GPS side, if there are any changes to the original expectation? And how much revenue was pulled forward? And Network Services, you mentioned the strength and you added more to the backlog. Could we expect a similar performance next year on that segment? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. GTS, the numbers aren\u2019t any different than what we gave last quarter. So, the total revenue on an annualized basis is expected to be approximately $72 million. The impact from the pull forward of closing a little bit early was about $3 million.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And in terms of services, I mean we have a backlog that supports a fourth quarter performance similar to what we enjoyed in the third quarter. That\u2019s not what we have guided to because we exceeded our expectations so greatly in, Q3 and Q4 has some holidays and all that. And in terms of next year, we really wouldn\u2019t hazard a guess until we have the benefit over the next four months or five months prior to when we give out full year 2023 guidance.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just looking at the change in guidance, what\u2019s the jump in other revenue in the U.S. coming from? Is that decommissioning fees or something similar and how much of that was in Q3 versus what you expect in Q4?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. It was \u2013 almost all of the jump is related to Q3, I would say. And it is related largely \u2013 it\u2019s a variety of things. But cash basis revenues, a portion of that, a big chunk of that is related to what we might call holdover fees, extra fees that are paid for somebody staying on the tower that\u2019s coming off, but they stay longer than they should. It also includes internationally payments from Digicel. We mentioned Digicel is a big contributor to the churn number internationally, which they are, but they have actually continued to make a number of payments. And so those payments are showing up basically in other now.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That\u2019s great. And I guess I also wanted to ask about expense trends that you are observing in the U.S. Obviously, the majority of your OpEx is ground rent escalators and that are fixed. So, that takes a lot of risk off the table. But what are you seeing and expecting as it relates to the rest of your expense base, like corporate, field operations and so on?\nJeff Stoops: We are seeing definitely some inflationary pressure there, Nick. And we are going to be giving out average compensation increases next year at a higher rate than we have given in the last couple of years. But when you look at \u2013 I think we are \u2013 our SG&A is only like 6% cash, cash SG&A, 6% of revenue. I mean it\u2019s just \u2013 it just really doesn\u2019t matter on the overall financial numbers. But we would be lying to you if we said that we were immune to that kind of stuff. But for us, it\u2019s just so much smaller of a percentage than it is for a lot of other companies.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That\u2019s great. And if I can squeeze in one last quick one. Obviously, as we look at the growth overseas, the value of the CPI-linked escalators are really showing their value in the current environment. Are there any caps on major contracts that we should be cognizant of, or are you guys uncapped on that front, and hence, essentially totally protected?\nBrendan Cavanagh: We are largely uncapped. I am trying to think if there are any, there may be one or two somewhere out there. But for the most part, it\u2019s not capped.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Williams from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, if I may. Can we talk about your Latin American churn? If I look at your guidance, it should be still up here in these 8% levels? I am just trying to figure out how much of that spills over into 2023? Do we remain at these 8% levels over the next few quarters given the Oi cadence and the consolidation churn in digital, etcetera? Second question is just on the service revenue, actually, the service margin profile. How do you expect that to pan out? Are we shifting from maybe permitting to more construction? And I think you hit a margin close to 26%, and wanted to see where that shakes out over the next few quarters. Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean I will take the latter question first. And Brendan, you can do the American churn. We are executing very well, Greg, on both the traditional permitting and zoning side of the business, as well as the construction side. So, the margin differential that you saw years ago between those two lines of our services business, they are not exactly the same, but the gap has closed tremendously. So, we still get a better margin on the zoning and the permitting side of things than we do on the construction. So, the mix of that will impact the margins. But I mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a hugely different margin next year. I think based on the way the work will flow and how we expect things to come in for business that has \u2013 I mean the first business that we typically see for any kind of new interest is going to be on the zoning and permitting side. So, I think it\u2019s not going to change a whole lot.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And then Greg, on the international churn piece, I would expect that the next couple of quarters, few quarters probably, will be in a similar range in terms of that percentage that you are looking at because of the timing of when some of the stuff started. The one thing I would also caveat about next year is just, this obviously only takes into account what\u2019s happened now, and there is \u2013 the one big thing that\u2019s out there that we are in the midst of conversations about is related to the Oi consolidation in Brazil. And as of today, there is nothing to report on that. But as we continue to have conversations, depending on where those end up, that may influence what next year\u2019s numbers look like.\nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDave Barden: Hey guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I got a bunch, Jeff, for you. I think the first most important is, what are you going as for trick or treating tonight with your kids? The second\u2026\nJeff Stoops: I am going as a grandfather.\nDave Barden: Yes. I am still interested in the costume. So, the second question is, you kind of highlighted the leverage being below the target. There was a time when you guys implemented your dividend that you thought maybe a lower leverage target would be the right target. I wondered if you would want to have a little bit of a conversation about how you are thinking about target leverage. And given that there is not a ton to do on acquisitions and you didn\u2019t do stock buybacks, even though stock has been pulling back, whether there has been some sort of change there. And if\u2026\nJeff Stoops: There really hasn\u2019t been a change there. I mean clearly, we have maintained our target but have operated almost entirely at the low end now for some time. And I think that\u2019s going to continue to be the case, if not dropping below. But the dropping below, if that happens, is going to be more a function of our dissatisfaction with poor capital allocation opportunities and some financial theoretical belief that this is the optimum leverage level given our access to capital. And one of the thing, and you may be driving at this, Dave, we are not going to turn into a high dividend relative to AFFO company. We just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do. We will grow our dividend probably as faster, faster than well, certainly our peers and maybe anybody else in the REIT industry as we have the last couple of years. But it\u2019s still going to be lower as a percentage of AFFO because we like the flexibility that it provides.\nDave Barden: Okay. Great. And then the second question I had was one of the things that distinguished you guys from peers has been a pivot to fixed rate debt. Obviously, that changed a little bit with GTS. I think someone asked earlier about the plan for the GTS that you guys talked about the refinancing of the ABS, but I don\u2019t \u2013 what is the plan for the variable rate debt in the portfolio? I guess this is one for Mark. Are you going to go \u2013 are you going to lock in higher fixed rates, or are you going to try to rated out in the meantime?\nMark DeRussy: It will be a mix of both. We have, as you probably have noticed from our prior ABS financings where we have the opportunity to raise more than the amount to be refinanced, we have been rated for issuance well above 640. We are trying to figure out exactly how far above that that we go. So, there will be some reduction in the revolver from that, and then the rest of it is going to occur pretty quickly from cash flow.\nDave Barden: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then my last question, if I could, please, Jeff is, I have always kind of considered you a little bit of a Brazilian policy wonk. Now that the election is over, how \u2013 what do you think is next in terms of implications for the telecom industry, currency, etcetera? Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Well, we all know that Lula is left of Bolsonaro, but he has gotten elected by a coalition of not only the more left us, but also some more centrist populations as well. At the same time, if Lula got elected President, the Congress down there got actually more to the right. So, you are going to have a classic draw between the President and between Congress, and Congress has a lot of power in Brazil. So, I think for us, it\u2019s going to continue to be kind of a good business environment without a lot of policy changes. That\u2019s \u2013 I mean I think the whatever \u2013 and I don\u2019t know that he would have proposed anything. But assuming, for hypothetical purposes, that Lula proposed some things that would be very much to the left and detrimental to business, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen because of the Congress.\nDave Barden: Okay. Thank you, guys. I really appreciate.\nJeff Stoops: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino from Green Street. Your line is open.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. Hey Jeff, I wanted to make sure I am understanding your enthusiasm for domestic new leasing activity next year, especially compared to one of your peers that gave \u201823 guidance that implies a step down from macro tower new leasing activity. So, I guess the question is really your \u201822 guide this year for $67 million in new leasing activity. Do you think we are going to look back on that as a high watermark, or do you think that there is actually room for that to grow going forward?\nJeff Stoops: I am glad you asked that question because when we are conveying good feelings about next year, it\u2019s exactly around that number for 2022. That same calculation and that same thing that we will be posting when we start our bridge for next year \u2013 next earnings release, that\u2019s really what we are speaking to. So, I think I just answered your question.\nDavid Guarino: Alright. I can read through that. And second one then switching gears on it. Given the volatility and the pretty rapid change we have seen this year in a lot of foreign currencies, maybe not the experience in Brazil, but certainly a lot of other markets. Have you reconsidered how you underwrite the risk for international investments relative to what you might have been doing at the start of the year?\nJeff Stoops: Not really because the rate of currency movement has largely been matched off by the CPIs in those countries.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And all of our revenues in those countries are escalated based on CPI. There will be some minor exceptions to that plus or minus. But in general, that relationship has helped.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on the debt, again, given the macro environment, has your ability to tap into the secured debt market changed recently? And do you think that will continue to remain a primary source of funding going forward?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Brendan, we do think that it will remain a primary source of funding for us. Our ability to tap into it has not really been impacted. It\u2019s really just a question of cost. That\u2019s the only question mark. But the access to capital and having plenty of capital available to us in those markets still remains very strong.\nBrendan Lynch: Okay. Great. And then just one other question. It looks like your discretionary CapEx guidance came down by about $35 million for the year. Is that related to labor availability or supply chain constraints or other rising costs that might be leading to a slowdown in development projects?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No. It\u2019s mostly just timing of some smaller acquisitions and when we think they are going to close.\nBrendan Lynch: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Jeff, you guys talked about commencements coming in a little bit quicker than expected. But could you update us on the backlog of unsigned lease applications? Where do you stand today relative to a year ago and last quarter? Then for Brendan, obviously, international CPIs have been high, but have come down a little bit, at least in Brazil. I guess if we put estimates aside today, inflation stayed where it\u2019s at, what should we be looking for, for that escalator next year? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. In terms of our backlog for leases, new leases and amendments, we are just a tad off of where we were at the end of second quarter, which was one of the highest that we have had in many, many, many years. So, we are still looking at a very, very strong backlog, which just underlies a lot of our optimism going forward. And Brendan, I am going to let you handle the second question.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean you are asking me to predict the CPI for next year in Brazil, which it\u2019s hard to do with certainty, especially given the recent elections and all that, we have to kind of see how that all settles out. But I think high-single digits is a reasonable assumption today, and perhaps it could be higher than that. But I would target somewhere in that 8% to 10% range.\nJeff Stoops: Well, I mean there is going to be a forward curve out there. I mean we do planning around those things because nobody has an accurate crystal ball on that. We rely on the published consensus forward curve [ph].\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean, the big thing though, Brandon, for us is some of it comes down to timing. Obviously, we have concentrated periods at which our leases escalate. So, depending on where things are during those windows of time, it has either a greater or lesser impact on our specific numbers.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJeff Stoops: Great. Thanks Carolyn and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to our next release in February, where we will talk about 2023 and happy Halloween.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening everyone. As is appropriate on Halloween, we are pleased to present a treat of an earnings report. The third quarter exceeded almost all expectations and benefited from the significant level of wireless deployment activity by our carrier customers. Notwithstanding the broader challenging macroeconomic environment, our business was extremely busy and we were able to again increase our full year outlook across all key metrics. We raised our full year outlook for total revenue by $49 million after raising it by $64 million last quarter. Domestic organic contributions to leasing revenue growth in the third quarter were the highest for the year and our outlook implies an even higher contribution in the fourth quarter. Our services business produced the highest quarterly contribution of revenue and gross profit in our history and we again grew our services backlog. Our rate of return on invested capital was 10.6% for the quarter, the highest in at least 10 years. It really was a remarkable quarter. In the U.S., each of our carrier customers remained busy during the quarter as they have throughout the year, building out their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile was our most active customer during the quarter, continuing their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon, AT&T and DISH were again very active in the quarter, with 5G-related new lease and amendment signings. Site leasing revenue growth from domestic new leases and amendments has been strong this year, growing throughout the course of the year. We expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again next year as well based on the strength of the organic leasing activity during 2022. Internationally, we had our best organic leasing quarter of the year. During the third quarter, we saw more of a shift toward upgrades at existing sites, with 63% of new business signed up in the quarter coming from amendments to existing leases and 37% coming through new leases. International leasing activity was again led by strong contributions from Brazil and South Africa, our two largest markets. Brazil has performed very well this year. Not only has lease-up been above our internal expectations for the year, we have also had larger contributions from CPI-based escalators, while maintaining a relatively stable foreign exchange rate. In addition, we closed on the previously disclosed GTS acquisition of over 2,600 sites earlier in October. The integration of these sites has only recently begun, but is proceeding smoothly and ahead of plan. As a reminder, these sites have 2.1 tenants per tower and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum auctions in Brazil as a driver. These sites do contain some legacy oil leases, but a smaller percentage than the rest of our portfolio. With regard to Oi, we have begun conversations with some of the carriers that are absorbing the Oi wireless business to discuss potential mutually beneficial and efficient arrangements around the integration of these networks. We still anticipate total churn of approximately $20 million to $30 million associated with the Oi merger on our legacy sites plus an additional estimate of approximately $3 million associated with the GTS or Grupo TorreSur sites. These numbers do not include any potential impact to pass-through reimbursements as those items will be neutral to tower cash flow. We also continue to produce revenue from tenancies associated with Oi's wireline business, which is unaffected by these mergers. We have a strong relationship with our Brazilian customers and look forward to working with them through this process. With respect to our balance sheet due to early refinancings completed over the last few years and some well placed interest rate swaps, we have positioned ourselves well to address more challenging debt markets. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.8x, below our target range at our lowest level in years. And even with our large fourth quarter Brazilian tower acquisition, we expect to be at or below 7.0x at year end. We have only one $640 million debt instrument maturing between now and October of 2024, representing approximately 5% of our debt outstanding. That instrument matures in March of 2023. And while interest rates are certainly higher today, we still have great access to incremental and refinancing debt capital given the strength of our cash flows. We expect to refinance our pending first quarter maturity during the next several months. During periods with an elevated cost of capital and increased interest rates, it is even more imperative to continue our disciplined and opportunistic approach to investing capital. We are fortunate to be in a strong industry, benefiting from the continued growth in wireless, but also having the strength of significant free cash flow generation, largely fixed cost and scaled operations. It is during times like these that we really appreciate the strength of our underlying business. We are very pleased with the third quarter performance. As indicated by our updated outlook, we are also well positioned to finish out 2022 on a high note. We will be providing our initial 2023 outlook on our next quarterly earnings call. But based on this year's organic leasing activity and the significant network projects ahead of our customers, we anticipate our leasing results to continue to be strong into next year. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, focused on maximizing returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success and we look forward to a strong finish to the year. And with that, Caroline, we are now ready for questions. Yes, I will take the last one first, Jon. We are still at least with respect to SBA and its assets in the capacity stage and the overlay and the initial deployment of mid-band spectrum. While we fully expect densification to come, capacity for us continues to be the current driver. Now, we take that as a good thing, because that really just lengthens out the extent of the activity timeline for us. In terms of seller expectations, they are changing some. They have not fully reset to the degree that the public company multiples have compressed. What that means for SBA is there will be a lot of things that we take a pass on unless the price is right. We loved what we did in Tanzania. We loved what we did in GTS. There is a lot of things that we passed on because those expect \u2013 there is still a gap in those seller expectations. But they have started to move actually down. We like build-to-suits provided they are the right terms. Tuck-in acquisitions and, for that matter, new markets would all fall into kind of the same comment I made about finding things that are right for us. And we're only going to do things if we believe that it's right for us from a price and a growth perspective. And as \u2013 if we do things great, if we don't, you'll see what happened in the third quarter, which is that we de-lever pretty quickly until we do see those right capital allocation opportunities. Yes. I don't know. Brendan, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know that we've had any changes in the book-to-bill. And on the Edge business, Mike, we've actually seen some great progress, but it's still \u2013 it's great from where we started, which was, of course, at zero. But it's not really material. I would say we probably have either in operation or under construction 30 to 40 of these facilities. And the primary demand for them has been Edge computing and fiber and cable regeneration. But what we found to be the key to success in this area is really the state of and the location of the tower site because where it's ready to go and it's close to or on top of existing fiber makes all that much more attractive. So on an absolute basis, yes, we've seen a lot of growth. On a financial basis, it's still, of course, very small. But we're encouraged by what we've seen. No, because it's still small. What I will tell you, though, is that we're really happy with the incremental return on invested capital for these projects. And at its core, that's what I think you have hired us to do. So we're very happy with that. And as long as we can make that return on invested capital, albeit small, perhaps for a little while, we're going to keep doing it. Hey, Ric. Well, keep in mind, because of the nature of the business, where you sign things up today, but you don't begin to recognize revenue until later that we're today already shaping next year's financial results. So that's a point of confidence. The other thing I would say is that we track to the tower which of our customers have upgraded their mid-band spectrum on our sites. And the number is actually fairly low across the board for us at this point. And our customers will do what they will do. But knowing what this means for them in terms of the amount of the money, frankly, for first of all, that they spend on the spectrum the \u2013 at least as reported, competitive differences between some of them from a spectrum perspective and others, where they are on our towers and the fact that the CapEx numbers that you get from them are extremely broad. We feel next year is going to be pretty good. Well, Grupo TorreSur is funded. I mean, that you say, think about the funding, that's already funded. That got funded from cash on hand and our revolver. So the next thing we're looking at is the refinancing of the $640 million ABS instrument in March where we've got that teed up, ready to go. I don't want to speculate too much on the interest increase. There will be, of course, an interest increase. I mean, Brendan, what's that instrument bearing today? Well, let's put a little parameters around that. I mean, we're thinking it's going to have a 6 handle on it, right? But then \u2013 but keep in mind, we're going to be producing over $1 billion of AFFO. We don't have another debt instrument due until October of 2024. So we're going to be in great shape. We're going to have capital to invest and it's either going to get \u2013 we're either going to see value in portfolio acquisitions based on my earlier comments. We may or may not. We are going to be \u2013 continue to be opportunistic around stock repurchases or third and I would say this is somewhat unlikely given the first two, you are going to see a big decline in our leverage ratio. Yes, I don't want to get too granular. All of the \u2013 well, let's say, T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T all still have work to do with us based on our analysis of where they are with their mid-band spectrum. Some of those are further ahead than others. And I think the answer to that question has been well reported. And then Dish has really got a lot of business signed up, and their focus right now is getting all that on air to meet the June 2023 requirements, which based on everything we can tell, they are in a very good position to do. And then we expect them to come back and begin to work on the 2025 requirements. So while it's varied landed in terms of which of those are busiest, and I don't think they want me actually commenting on that. I will tell you that there is a high level of business from all of them. And they all, at least based on our analysis, still have a lot to work, a lot of work left to do on our portfolio. Yes. I think they are mostly 6x12 or 10x20-foot shelters that look like the traditional wireless shelter that certain carriers have used historically. They have got air conditioning. They have got a lot of logistics to check temperatures and alarms and things like that. They basically are for racks of equipment, and they start out with two or three rack capacity and can be expanded beyond that. And Brendan, what are we \u2013 what's our average cost on those? Yes, they are not \u2013 at that size, they are not being sold on a traditional data center power basis. A lot of the uses today are for regeneration of signal for cable and fiber companies. And that's not really how that's priced and sold. The most populated of the carriers would be in their satisfaction rate on our towers would be in the 50%ish range and others are below that. Just based on the nature of the spectrum is being transmitted? Probably. Probably not. Probably it's all going to be based on the way the equipment looks. And based on your description of the third alternative lower band, deeper lower band, I mean, as you're describing it, I'm envisioning that's going to be the most intensive on the equipment side. So they would be based on that, Walt, as opposed to the fact that they are transmitting their own. I mean, even though CBRS is shared and not necessarily owned, we wouldn't differentiate somebody's use of CBRS versus their use of their own spectrum, I don't believe. I don't think we ever have put it that way. We are always in discussions with Charter and Comcast. But I would say that those scenarios that you lay out, for my personal opinion, I think they are still somewhat in the future. Yes. Yes. And in terms of services, I mean we have a backlog that supports a fourth quarter performance similar to what we enjoyed in the third quarter. That's not what we have guided to because we exceeded our expectations so greatly in, Q3 and Q4 has some holidays and all that. And in terms of next year, we really wouldn't hazard a guess until we have the benefit over the next four months or five months prior to when we give out full year 2023 guidance. We are seeing definitely some inflationary pressure there, Nick. And we are going to be giving out average compensation increases next year at a higher rate than we have given in the last couple of years. But when you look at \u2013 I think we are \u2013 our SG&A is only like 6% cash, cash SG&A, 6% of revenue. I mean it's just \u2013 it just really doesn't matter on the overall financial numbers. But we would be lying to you if we said that we were immune to that kind of stuff. But for us, it's just so much smaller of a percentage than it is for a lot of other companies. Yes. I mean I will take the latter question first. And Brendan, you can do the American churn. We are executing very well, Greg, on both the traditional permitting and zoning side of the business, as well as the construction side. So, the margin differential that you saw years ago between those two lines of our services business, they are not exactly the same, but the gap has closed tremendously. So, we still get a better margin on the zoning and the permitting side of things than we do on the construction. So, the mix of that will impact the margins. But I mean I don't think it's going to be a hugely different margin next year. I think based on the way the work will flow and how we expect things to come in for business that has \u2013 I mean the first business that we typically see for any kind of new interest is going to be on the zoning and permitting side. So, I think it's not going to change a whole lot. I am going as a grandfather. There really hasn't been a change there. I mean clearly, we have maintained our target but have operated almost entirely at the low end now for some time. And I think that's going to continue to be the case, if not dropping below. But the dropping below, if that happens, is going to be more a function of our dissatisfaction with poor capital allocation opportunities and some financial theoretical belief that this is the optimum leverage level given our access to capital. And one of the thing, and you may be driving at this, Dave, we are not going to turn into a high dividend relative to AFFO company. We just don't think that's the right thing to do. We will grow our dividend probably as faster, faster than well, certainly our peers and maybe anybody else in the REIT industry as we have the last couple of years. But it's still going to be lower as a percentage of AFFO because we like the flexibility that it provides. Well, we all know that Lula is left of Bolsonaro, but he has gotten elected by a coalition of not only the more left us, but also some more centrist populations as well. At the same time, if Lula got elected President, the Congress down there got actually more to the right. So, you are going to have a classic draw between the President and between Congress, and Congress has a lot of power in Brazil. So, I think for us, it's going to continue to be kind of a good business environment without a lot of policy changes. That's \u2013 I mean I think the whatever \u2013 and I don't know that he would have proposed anything. But assuming, for hypothetical purposes, that Lula proposed some things that would be very much to the left and detrimental to business, I don't think that's going to happen because of the Congress. Sure. I am glad you asked that question because when we are conveying good feelings about next year, it's exactly around that number for 2022. That same calculation and that same thing that we will be posting when we start our bridge for next year \u2013 next earnings release, that's really what we are speaking to. So, I think I just answered your question. Not really because the rate of currency movement has largely been matched off by the CPIs in those countries. Yes. In terms of our backlog for leases, new leases and amendments, we are just a tad off of where we were at the end of second quarter, which was one of the highest that we have had in many, many, many years. So, we are still looking at a very, very strong backlog, which just underlies a lot of our optimism going forward. And Brendan, I am going to let you handle the second question. Well, I mean there is going to be a forward curve out there. I mean we do planning around those things because nobody has an accurate crystal ball on that. We rely on the published consensus forward curve [ph]."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We continued our very strong 2022 with another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results were well ahead of our internal expectations and have allowed us to again increase our outlook for our full year results. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $587.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $575.6 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but they were a headwind on comparisons to the third quarter of 2021, negatively impacting revenues by $3.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.9% over the third quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 9.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8% on a gross basis and 4.8% on a net basis, including 3.2% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity, or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter, was very solid again with meaningful contributions from each of our largest customers. The combination of our strong third quarter leasing activity level and faster-than-anticipated commencements of new amendments have allowed us to increase for the second consecutive quarter our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease-up. During the third quarter, amendment activity represented 58% of our domestic bookings, with 42% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented over 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we also experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. Our reduced 2022 domestic churn amounts are expected to shift to 2023. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 8.4% of churn or 13.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again as we had our best quarter of the year in terms of new revenue signed up. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contributions from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.6% on a constant currency basis. As anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the quarter due primarily to carrier consolidations and Digicel's previously announced exit from Panama. During the third quarter, 81.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.2% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $464.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.8% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.3% or 91.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $446.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.3% in the quarter, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.2%. Approximately, 95% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business again produced new record level results, with $88.3 million in revenue and $22.8 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs, finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record third quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong third quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $26 million. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO in the third quarter, was $339.4 million. AFFO per share was $3.10, an increase of 15.1% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 131 communication sites for total cash consideration of $54.9 million. We also built 113 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 11, we closed on the previously announced acquisition from Grupo TorreSur, adding 2,632 sites in Brazil for cash consideration of $725 million. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 34 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $28.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the first \u2013 excuse me, by the end of the first quarter of next year. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Based on results and activities during and subsequent to the third quarter, we have updated our outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics due to outperformance in the third quarter, lower churn expectations as a result of timing and the earlier closing of the GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by higher interest costs and higher estimated cash taxes from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and excited for a strong finish to 2022. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet. Nothing material. I will say that actually, if you noticed on our bridge for domestic contributions from new leases and amendments that we did up that contribution for 2022, it was 66 last quarter and 67 now. And that change is really largely due to a slight acceleration in timing, and that's mostly around amendments that just kicked in a little bit quicker than we had projected. But it's a pretty small change relative to the big picture. I don't think there is been any material move in that you would point out. The one that's getting paid off is just below 3.5%. So you should expect that, that will be significantly higher. Well, it depends on the size and the scale, obviously. Deployment there for something along the lines of what Jeff described, you're looking at somewhere in the $100,000 range. But if we do a bigger, more fulsome Edge, it compute through data center where it's a bigger operation, it can be as much as $400,000 or $500,000. Yes. GTS, the numbers aren't any different than what we gave last quarter. So, the total revenue on an annualized basis is expected to be approximately $72 million. The impact from the pull forward of closing a little bit early was about $3 million. Yes. It was \u2013 almost all of the jump is related to Q3, I would say. And it is related largely \u2013 it's a variety of things. But cash basis revenues, a portion of that, a big chunk of that is related to what we might call holdover fees, extra fees that are paid for somebody staying on the tower that's coming off, but they stay longer than they should. It also includes internationally payments from Digicel. We mentioned Digicel is a big contributor to the churn number internationally, which they are, but they have actually continued to make a number of payments. And so those payments are showing up basically in other now. We are largely uncapped. I am trying to think if there are any, there may be one or two somewhere out there. But for the most part, it's not capped. Yes. And then Greg, on the international churn piece, I would expect that the next couple of quarters, few quarters probably, will be in a similar range in terms of that percentage that you are looking at because of the timing of when some of the stuff started. The one thing I would also caveat about next year is just, this obviously only takes into account what's happened now, and there is \u2013 the one big thing that's out there that we are in the midst of conversations about is related to the Oi consolidation in Brazil. And as of today, there is nothing to report on that. But as we continue to have conversations, depending on where those end up, that may influence what next year's numbers look like. And all of our revenues in those countries are escalated based on CPI. There will be some minor exceptions to that plus or minus. But in general, that relationship has helped. Yes. Brendan, we do think that it will remain a primary source of funding for us. Our ability to tap into it has not really been impacted. It's really just a question of cost. That's the only question mark. But the access to capital and having plenty of capital available to us in those markets still remains very strong. No. It's mostly just timing of some smaller acquisitions and when we think they are going to close. Yes. I mean you are asking me to predict the CPI for next year in Brazil, which it's hard to do with certainty, especially given the recent elections and all that, we have to kind of see how that all settles out. But I think high-single digits is a reasonable assumption today, and perhaps it could be higher than that. But I would target somewhere in that 8% to 10% range. Yes. I mean, the big thing though, Brandon, for us is some of it comes down to timing. Obviously, we have concentrated periods at which our leases escalate. So, depending on where things are during those windows of time, it has either a greater or lesser impact on our specific numbers."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, VP of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, August 01, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA continued building on our strong first quarter with an even better second quarter with across the board results ahead of our expectations and backlog supportive of an equally good or possibly even better second half of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $580.2 million and cash site leasing revenues were $570.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were largely in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but we're a tailwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $3.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.4% over the second quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.7% of churn. On a gross basis same-tower growth was 8.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.1% on a gross basis and 4.1% on a net basis, including 3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was very strong again and incrementally higher than the first quarter of this year. In addition, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs remain very healthy as well. The combination of our strong second quarter leasing activity level and our backlogs have allowed us to increase our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease up. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 66% of our domestic bookings with 34% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish; represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.6% net, including 7.1% of churn or 12.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again and also higher than we saw in the first quarter. We continued to see strong customer activity levels in many of our markets, as well as increased contributions from inflation based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another particularly strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 14.2% on a constant currency basis. International churn was elevated in the quarter as anticipated, due primarily to carrier consolidations and other customer financial challenges, mainly in Guatemala and Panama. During the second quarter, 80.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 13.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $459.6 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.9% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.2% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were impacted on a year-over-year basis by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $437.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.2% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.3%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the fifth quarter in a row with $71.8 million in revenue and $17.3 million of segment operating profit. We also continued to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record second quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong second quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $40 million. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $335.3 million. AFFO per share was $3.07 an increase of 16.3% over the second quarter of 2021. During the second quarter, we continue to expand our portfolio acquiring 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil, which we previously disclosed with our first quarter results for total cash consideration of $127.3 million. We also built 100 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 200 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $85 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract, by the end of the year. In addition, during the quarter, we entered into a contract with Grupo TorreSur or GTS to purchase their remaining approximately 2,600 tower sites in Brazil for $725 million. We anticipate closing on this acquisition during the fourth quarter of this year and expect these assets to produce approximately $68 million of tower cash flow during the first full year following closing, based on our current estimates of future exchange rates. These are assets we know well in a market we obviously know well, and this acquisition will be immediately accretive to AFFO per share upon closing. Jeff will share a little more about this acquisition in a moment. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years to land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now to the rest of the year, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics based on a combination of outperformance in the second quarter, strengthening activity levels in both services and leasing, lower churn expectations and anticipated contributions from the pending GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by weaker foreign exchange rates and higher interest costs from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are excited about the current operating environment and pleased with how our team has been able to execute in order to produce better than expected results and support our customers at a high level with all of their network initiatives. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who'll provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $12.3 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0 times, which is at the low end of our target range. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3 times equaling last quarter, the highest in the company's history. As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.9% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.3 years and the interest rate on 93% of our outstanding debt is fixed. And as of today, we have $480 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we chose instead to pursue the Brazil acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2022 were 107.9 million compared to 109.5 million at June 30, 2021, which is a reduction of 1.5%. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.6 million or $0.71 cents per share and today we announced that our board of directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.71 a share an increase of 22.4% over the third quarter of last year. The dividend will be payable on September 20, 2022 to shareholders of record as the be close of business on August 25, 2022. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had another great performance in the second quarter. All areas of our operations were very busy and executed at a very high level producing better than expected financial results and setting us up well for the second half of the year. Despite higher interest rates and weaker FX rates, we have meaningfully increased our full year outlook in all areas, including a $64 million increase in anticipated total revenue. Our strong results and increased outlook are driven by the current network investment initiatives around the globe. While there is a range in the degree of activity from each of our customers around the globe, collectively, they are producing very high levels of demand, which we expect will keep us very busy for the remainder of this year and well into 2023. As of this moment, we are not seeing any material adverse impact on our activity levels from supply chain labor or COVID-19 issues. In the US, each of our carrier customers remain busy during the quarter signing up new leases and amendments primarily associated with the build out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum. T-Mobile was very active during quarter and continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T each increased their 5G related signings with us from the first quarter with each focused on C-band deployments and AT&T beginning to incorporate 3.45 gigahertz spectrum into their deployments as well. And Dish also contributed to the quarter continuing to sign up new lease agreements in support of their nationwide 5G network build out. We are excited about the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auction, which will result in even more spectrum being deployed Internationally, we also had one of our best organic leasing quarters in a while, coupled with increased CPI based escalators in a number of our markets. International leasing activity was again led by strong new lease and amendment activity in Brazil, but we also saw significant executions in a number of our other markets, including South Africa and El Salvador. During the second quarter, we signed up 51% of new international revenue through new leases and 49% through amendments to existing leases; so almost evenly balanced. The combined US and international new leasing revenue signed up during the second quarter were the best we have produced in about seven years. On top of these outstanding leasing results, our services business had its best quarter in company history, producing record services revenue, and margin results for the fifth quarter in a row. Our services backlog finished the quarter at its highest level ever increasing our confidence in US carrier activity for the balance of the year and allowing us to increase our services outlook by 33% over the initial guidance we provided in February. I am extremely pleased with the job our team has done to deliver outstanding support to our customers during this critical time. In addition to our strong operational performance during the second quarter, we maintained our disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This quarter, we pursued a very attractive portfolio growth opportunity evidenced by our agreement to buy the remaining 2,600 towers owned by GTS in Brazil. GTS is one of the longest tenured independent tower companies in Brazil run by industry veterans we have known and respected for many years, individuals who know how to properly run a tower company. The majority of these sites are located in Sao Paul state and most are located in urban or suburban areas. The sites have 2.1 tenants per tower, and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil as the driver. This will be our second acquisition of towers from GTS. We like the current dynamic in Brazil quite a bit, and we are pleased to incorporate these high quality assets into our portfolio at a very accretive price. On this portfolio O8 and legacy Nextel leases represents 17% of the business. So while these towers present some variability around future churn outcomes, we believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize the future of these assets. This acquisition will increase SBAs total portfolio in Brazil by over 25% to over 12,500 sites and we expect the towers will be integrated with little to no incremental SG&A expense. We believe this increased size and scale will be an asset in upcoming OI consolidation discussions and will also position us well to capture more of the necessary incremental network investment that will be required of the remaining three legacy M&Os. Finally, we will be able to absorb this transaction while still maintaining leverage in our target 7 times to 7.5 times range. We expect this will be a very complimentary value enhancing investment in a market that we know very well. With regard to our balance sheet, we remain in good position. We have only one debt instrument representing 5% of our outstanding debt maturing in the next two years. 93% of our debt is fixed rate and our weighted average interest rate remains very low at 2.9%. With respect to that one instrument due March, 2023, our plan is to refinance that in the next six months as we watch and stay opportunistic around the credit markets. While incremental interest rates are higher, our access to capital remains very strong and we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we have historically used. We are really very well positioned to weather the challenging, broader macro environment. In addition to our strong balance sheet, growing AFFO and the steady and growing operational environment of our industry, the majority of our largest costs are fixed or increases our cap. As a result, we believe we are not only able to withstand the current inflationary environment, but we are able to continue growing our AFFO per share, creating additional value for our shareholders. In closing, we are very pleased with our first half of 2022. Our team performed well against a very strong demand environment. I expect more of the same throughout the rest of the year and into 2023. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success. I also want to take a brief moment to recognize and thank both Kurt Bagwell, our President of International and Tom Hunt, our General Council for their decades of service to SBA. Both will be retiring at the end of this year, but each has left an indelible mark on SBA and the industry. I appreciate their sacrifices and contributions and wish them all the best in retirement. And with that Moses, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator:  And first we go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. First curious if you give us an update on the domestic leasing environment and in particular, are you seeing any change in activity from AT&T after announced some of the progress it's made on mid band spectrum deployment and also what you're seeing out of dishes build, and then just secondly, with regards to the acquisition, can you talk a little bit more about how the valuation might be contemplating that 17% of leasing that could be subject to some future RA rationalization? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, clearly I'll take the last one first Mike. Clearly, 10.5 times is extremely attractive price that takes into account exactly that. We don't really believe any of the next revenue will stay on and we have heavily discounted the oil revenue as well in our underwriting. So yes, all that was taken into account when we arrived at the price. In terms of AT&T, I listened to their call and heard their comments and based on our observations in our markets, which are mostly suburban highway corridor and rural. I think the numbers that they were talking about mostly came from dense urban markets, which makes a lot of sense because that's how all new -- that's where all new generational upgrades start. So we still have in our opinion, a very, very long way to go with, AT&T and their C-band and 3.45 work and Dish is a very active contributor. They would represent most all of the new leases that we are signing domestically. So there will be some ebbs and flows as they work around their will have a -- they have already worked around their 2022 regulatory requirements and are now going to be working towards their 2023 regulatory requirements, but still a very, very active participant.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: With the leasing activity ramping up towards the end of the year, do you think that bodes well for the activity we should expect for '23? I know you're going to provide formal guidance later, but in terms of trajectory, some comments would be helpful to think about puts and takes into next year. And another question on churn it has been coming lower than you had expected. Is that pushed out to next year or are you seeing lower decommissioning than you had prior expectations? Thank you.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think Batya, the most we could say about the trajectory is that the fourth quarter of this year we believe will be the highest growth rate of the year and we'll let you extrapolate what that means going forward. And obviously we'll give a full review when we give our 2023 guidance. Brendan, I'm going to let you take the churn question.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, the churn is -- it is mostly you should think of it as rolling into next year or future year it's largely timing related as opposed to below our expectations. It's just the timing primarily around the Sprint, T-Mobile decommissioning is a little bit more deferred than the estimates that we had made, but we don't expect the total to really be any different.\nBatya Levi: Great. Maybe just to follow up on that, Brendan, I think you had originally said maybe it's $30 million in '22. Should we assume that it's closer to $27 million now, and then if you could give us a guidance for '23, that'd be great.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it was well, last quarter we actually brought it down about $3 million and we brought it down about another $3 million this quarter. So this year is probably closer to '24 that's what's assumed in our numbers right now for '22, for 2022. And next year we're probably somewhere in the $15 million to $25 million range. It's a fairly wide range, but obviously there are some uncertainties around exact timing, but somewhere in that $20-ish million level.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Want to follow up on some of Michael's questions? Why was now the right time? Was it just the right price as far as doing the GTS deal and help us understand maybe as we should think about total exposure to Nextel and timing for Nextel to affect your international operations and I've got a follow up.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it was the right time because the opportunity presented itself at a time and on terms where we thought it was very attractive for our future value creation. What's going on in Brazil right now is, they've got a fairly hawkish central bank. They have -- I think they're little bit ahead of the US in terms of their economy having, being dancing around a recession. The demand, notwithstanding that for cellular and 5G continues to mushroom in Brazil. You have, you know, this rationalization going on with the oil transaction for three carriers who now have bought a lot of new spectrum that needs to be deployed and are in a better market share position to do all that. So we like the dynamic a lot, Rick and we know these assets well and we know the sellers well, and all things kind of came together in the right way.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah, Rick, we've been kind of ballparking on our portfolio of at about $20 million to $30 million US over the next many years. This portfolio actually reduces our exposure to oil on a percentage basis in Brazil, but would probably add somewhere in the $3-ish million of incremental oil churn would be our current estimate.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And you all know me. I really harp on this whole amortization of prepaid rent. I don't like it. I know you have to account for it. It's just -- it's not cash. Yours has been very tiny. I think about $25 million. Crown did acknowledge and provide a table, this earning season on where their level was at $560 million, drop it to maybe $450 million maybe going in and lower American tower talked about theirs had been maybe $140 million dropping to $110 million. Should we think of your kind of $25 million a year as a good number because again, we really think cash, AFO and funds available for distribution is the right way to do valuations.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. That's -- obviously it's been trending down. Part of the reason it's trending down Rick is because as we've done amendments and had longer terms to some of our tenant leases, you amortize it over a longer period of time. So it's actually had a reducing effect. So it really is just a function of how much augmentation work we do that we get reimbursed for and which leases that relates to how much time they have. But I think based on the way that it's trended, that number that you just mentioned of $25 million or so is probably a reasonable estimate, but it's been higher in the past and it's been lower. So, we'll see how it goes, but, I think that's a reasonable estimate.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. We're always going to disclose it very specifically, Rick, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nRic Prentiss: I love getting paid, right?\nJeffrey Stoops: Understand it for what it is. So it's not something we look to discourage but you can depend on us that it's always going to be clearly marked out.\nRic Prentiss: It's great for return on capital. I just like to think of it as net capital return on yield kind of thing, as opposed to an AFFO number. I just don't like it an AFFO.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, no, I hear you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good evening. On the M&A market obviously the transaction multiple, you said it's accretive. It's certainly lower than we've seen elsewhere. Do you think this was a particular situation given the oil exposure, given the Brazil market, or do you sense a turn that maybe it's going to be easier to be a buyer in the private markets than it has been for the last couple of years? Anything changing there either in towers or for ground leases, etcetera. And then on the leverage you came down to seven point times, obviously rates have been rising, you've got a great liquidity profile, but any updates you want to stay more towards the lower end or are you still happy right within that 7 to 7.5 going forward in this rate environment?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think as long as we can continue to produce the organic growth Simon, we're fine in the 7 to 7.5 times. But, if we don't find good things to buy, it'll obviously be trending lower. In terms of your first question, I think there are some breaks on the margins that are happening around the world in terms of seller and buyer expectations coming more together. But in this particular case, this was more a situation of these particular assets, our familiarity with them, the fact that it was the last tranche of towers that the seller had and needed to sell them to basically liquidate some funds and do some things that private equity needs to do. So I would attribute it more to this deal that I would a wholesale change in the buying environment. Although I do think that is improving.\nSimon Flannery: And what sort of clarity can you give us on the -- or what have you assumed on the timing of the next oil churn for these assets?\nJeffrey Stoops: It's over the next several years. Some of it is specific to the timeframes that of the terms of those agreements, Simon and they're all spread out to different dates but you should assume over the next three years roughly on average, but it won't be even, it'll be certain amount each.\nSimon Flannery: So, that's $68 million includes presumably some churn in the next 12 months after closing.\nJeffrey Stoops: A little bit. Yes.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Thanks for taking my questions. First, two quick clarifications first for Brendan. Brendan, you said that you expect about $3 million in oil churn from the GTS towers. Can, you share what your expectation is for the next churn?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I don't want to give the exact number but, there the oil, well, as Jeff said, we're assuming that all of the next revenue goes away. The total for oil and next tell is about 17%. So Nextel is roughly half of that. So you can probably do the math from there.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then your expectation for other revenue in the US in '22, went from zero last quarter to $5 million this quarter, what that a function of, and was that realized this quarter?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yes, it was realized this quarter. It's basically there's a few different things in there, but it's essentially what we consider cash basis revenue, which is stuff that we're collecting kind of one off. Sometimes there's extra fees that are paid or holdover fees, things that are not part of the recurring ongoing lease. So we classify it as other, but the increase is really that we got more of that than we expected. So almost all of that is stuff that we realized in the second quarter. There may be a small amount of projected for the second half of the year, but most of it was actually realized.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Stuff that doesn't go in the $66 million bucket. Right because, we want to be careful as to how folks think about that year after year after year.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Great. That's terrific and then one more substantive question and any change in behaviour from you'll call it non-traditional customers like cable that might be worth calling out that would suggest, either they're more likely or less likely to be a meaningful customer in coming years.\nJeffrey Stoops: No real change, Nick. No real change that comes to mind.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey guys. Thanks. just to go back to the US for a second, can you tell us, is there sort of flat and running steady from here, or is there sort of an acceleration happening in that one? Just trying to get an idea of what's driving the back half strength and the durability there. Jeff, it was interesting you mentioned, continuing strength in '23 and maybe '24. So anything you can add to us there? And then second what's driving the service revenue growth and anything you can sort of help us on there if it's shifting at the margin. Thanks very much.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, the services revenue is pretty straightforward. It's just more activity, more stuff going and our services business is almost entirely gained gleaned from our own towers. So it's just a lot of activity, Phil. And in terms of the -- remember we report those growth rates on a trailing 12 month basis. So a lot of what you're going to see in our financial reports for the second or the third and the fourth quarter, we already know, it's already kind of on the books. So, that part of it there's much less risk, so to speak than those and as we move through the year as a calendar year company, the risk drops and drops and drops. So here we are in August, our year isn't entirely baked yet, but it's pretty close. Yeah. And so to your question on dish being a part of it, they're certainly a part of it because they've been a big part of our leasing activity success over the last really last year. And so the timing of when those leases commence is a driver. And so it's certainly a contributing factor to the increasing growth that we expect in Q3 and Q4.\nPhil Cusick: Yep. Jeff, Jeff, you sort of cautioned us from taking that fourth quarter exit run rate from this year and extrapolating that onto next year each quarter. Do you think that that's starting to look more reasonable as you get closer to 23?\nJeffrey Stoops: I think I'd like to save all that till my 2023 guidance Phil.\nOperator: Next. We'll go to line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: I have one follow up and one other question. The follow up is just on the last question on services, any color you can share, just in terms of the breadth of carrier contributions across the big four in terms of what's driving the upside on services. And then just, secondly, in terms of the edge strategy, any thoughts, updates in terms of how you're thinking about it, many difference in terms of how you're thinking about the relative to any use cases internationally? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well internationally, recall and we talked about this last quarter, the data center we bought in Brazil. We are having more advanced discussions there around CRAN  and other carrier deployments that, we'll tie into owning a data center and data center expertise. So that's encouraging, but in terms of the edge itself, we're adding couple three, four, five, maybe as many as 10 new many facilities a quarter, but it's still we're not yet prepared to say the edge is here and it's at the tower site. It's all going in the right direction, but it still needs more time, certainly is still a ways off from being material. Now in terms of the services contributions, I believe in our 10-Q we disclose who our top services customers are. So I will accelerate that for you that, and it is T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish are going to be the top three, right. Brendan. Yeah, for this quarter Tmobile, certainly the number one. Yeah. Yeah.\nMatt Niknam: Great. All right, appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: I wanted to check real quick. You mentioned the 2.5 gigahertz auction that's going on right now. Generally most people think T-Mobile will be the only meaningful bidder there, but just wondering if you have any thoughts and kind of service overlap with some of the -- some of the licenses that are up for auction. And whether you think that can maybe be a meaningful contributor for you looking out the next year or two?\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, a number of folks in addition to T-Mobile registered, I would agree with you only based on what I read, most folks expect T-Mobile to be the big winner and any kind of spectrum for us is new spectrum is going to prove valuable in one degree or another. Now, if it's folks who don't have existing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to deploy, that's going to generally mean new radios and antennas. So that can be a little more impactful than not, but just having more spectrum and greater densification that will permit is a good thing. So, I'm not really going to speculate as to who else is going to put in bids that ultimately win the day. We're just happy that there's another auction, a very valuable mid band spectrum that we know ultimately gets deployed.\nEric Luebchow: Fair enough, and just related to T-Mobile seems like they've been running at a pretty fast pace but based on what they've said, it sounds like they'll be mostly done with their 2.5 and 600 overlays at some point, maybe by mid next year. So wondering if you see any sign that they could moderate activity, or do you think maybe there's still some opportunity, especially with the C-band licenses and the 3.45 that they've get to deploy?\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah, I think there'll be opportunities. And I think when all of our customers talk about when this spectrum gets deployed, they they're generally talking about coverage and that's just really, the end of coverage is the beginning of densification and all the infill and other things that will ultimately be driven by consumer uptake of 5G apps and products. So when we think about these periods of additional investment, they have always in our history gone well beyond the dates that folks talk about achieving their pops, their desired pops coverage, because then you just -- then it gets to densification, which is much different.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. Just a quick one from me on the financing market. Did you guys mention how you're planning on funding the GTS transaction, and maybe for Brendan, if you could just comment on the relative attractiveness of a secured versus the unsecured markets today?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On GTS, as of right now, we plan to be opportunistic in the financing markets. That financing, we haven't been specific about that. We do have the capacity on our revolver and with the cash that we're generating from operations to handle it if necessary, but we do intend to be opportunistic. We do have a maturity. Our next step maturity actually comes up in March of next year and so that will be refinanced at some point between now and then, and there's capacity within our ABS structure to actually raise more money. So that might be a contributor. So we'll see how that goes. In the general sense of secured versus unsecured, I don't think they're obviously all up right now in terms of pricing. For us there's still availability and any of the markets that we typically use. So it's not a question of access, it's really just a question of pricing and so we intend to be take our time and be opportunistic. And as was mentioned in the script, we have other than this one maturity that I mentioned, which represents about 5% of our outstanding debt. We don't have any maturities for over two years. So we have the flexibility to be a little bit patient with that. But, I think you should expect we'll continue to use the secured markets as we have in the past. But a mix of both will likely be the path for us.\nJeffrey Stoops: Yeah. And while we may be opportunistic David and raise the money, from somewhere else for purposes of our outlook, it assumes cash on hand and a revolver draw.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Greg Williams with Cowen. Please. Go ahead.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one's just on the mix of colo versus amendments. I think you noted you're at elevated levels, like a third of the US, this new colo and two thirds amendments and I think International's a 51-49 split. Curious to hear your thoughts on where that could go from here. We had sort of pish-ish levels. Jeff, you mentioned we're going to go from coverage to densification. I would imagine that you'd see more amendments that way. So curious to hear your thoughts there. Second questions just on the service margin. If you are seeing this five quarters in a row record and you're going to more of a construction phase, would that mean the service margin could decline a bit as you shift away from like playing and designing towards construction? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops: Well, the short answer to your last question is yes. So that could vary very well happen and I'm sorry, what was color versus amendments and the mix in terms of a shift, if you kind of go back really the colo side of it in the US is heavily driven by Dish. And so as you have a little less dish contribution, you see the percentage shifting more towards amendments and I think with that, and the mix towards infill, as we talked about amendments will probably be trending higher as a percentage.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. When you think about how this is going to go, and there'll be exceptions of course to this, but for the most part, the rollouts by T-Mobilem, Verizon and AT&T are going to be heavily amendment. For Dish it's going to be more colo. And then when we get to the densification part, Greg, you kind of lean towards amendment, but I believe that you will see I think a higher percentage of brand new leases when we get to the deification stage.\nOperator:  And at this time there's no one in queue.\nJeffrey Stoops: Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. We had a great quarter and we look forward to our next report. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had another great performance in the second quarter. All areas of our operations were very busy and executed at a very high level producing better than expected financial results and setting us up well for the second half of the year. Despite higher interest rates and weaker FX rates, we have meaningfully increased our full year outlook in all areas, including a $64 million increase in anticipated total revenue. Our strong results and increased outlook are driven by the current network investment initiatives around the globe. While there is a range in the degree of activity from each of our customers around the globe, collectively, they are producing very high levels of demand, which we expect will keep us very busy for the remainder of this year and well into 2023. As of this moment, we are not seeing any material adverse impact on our activity levels from supply chain labor or COVID-19 issues. In the US, each of our carrier customers remain busy during the quarter signing up new leases and amendments primarily associated with the build out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum. T-Mobile was very active during quarter and continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T each increased their 5G related signings with us from the first quarter with each focused on C-band deployments and AT&T beginning to incorporate 3.45 gigahertz spectrum into their deployments as well. And Dish also contributed to the quarter continuing to sign up new lease agreements in support of their nationwide 5G network build out. We are excited about the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auction, which will result in even more spectrum being deployed Internationally, we also had one of our best organic leasing quarters in a while, coupled with increased CPI based escalators in a number of our markets. International leasing activity was again led by strong new lease and amendment activity in Brazil, but we also saw significant executions in a number of our other markets, including South Africa and El Salvador. During the second quarter, we signed up 51% of new international revenue through new leases and 49% through amendments to existing leases; so almost evenly balanced. The combined US and international new leasing revenue signed up during the second quarter were the best we have produced in about seven years. On top of these outstanding leasing results, our services business had its best quarter in company history, producing record services revenue, and margin results for the fifth quarter in a row. Our services backlog finished the quarter at its highest level ever increasing our confidence in US carrier activity for the balance of the year and allowing us to increase our services outlook by 33% over the initial guidance we provided in February. I am extremely pleased with the job our team has done to deliver outstanding support to our customers during this critical time. In addition to our strong operational performance during the second quarter, we maintained our disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This quarter, we pursued a very attractive portfolio growth opportunity evidenced by our agreement to buy the remaining 2,600 towers owned by GTS in Brazil. GTS is one of the longest tenured independent tower companies in Brazil run by industry veterans we have known and respected for many years, individuals who know how to properly run a tower company. The majority of these sites are located in Sao Paul state and most are located in urban or suburban areas. The sites have 2.1 tenants per tower, and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil as the driver. This will be our second acquisition of towers from GTS. We like the current dynamic in Brazil quite a bit, and we are pleased to incorporate these high quality assets into our portfolio at a very accretive price. On this portfolio O8 and legacy Nextel leases represents 17% of the business. So while these towers present some variability around future churn outcomes, we believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize the future of these assets. This acquisition will increase SBAs total portfolio in Brazil by over 25% to over 12,500 sites and we expect the towers will be integrated with little to no incremental SG&A expense. We believe this increased size and scale will be an asset in upcoming OI consolidation discussions and will also position us well to capture more of the necessary incremental network investment that will be required of the remaining three legacy M&Os. Finally, we will be able to absorb this transaction while still maintaining leverage in our target 7 times to 7.5 times range. We expect this will be a very complimentary value enhancing investment in a market that we know very well. With regard to our balance sheet, we remain in good position. We have only one debt instrument representing 5% of our outstanding debt maturing in the next two years. 93% of our debt is fixed rate and our weighted average interest rate remains very low at 2.9%. With respect to that one instrument due March, 2023, our plan is to refinance that in the next six months as we watch and stay opportunistic around the credit markets. While incremental interest rates are higher, our access to capital remains very strong and we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we have historically used. We are really very well positioned to weather the challenging, broader macro environment. In addition to our strong balance sheet, growing AFFO and the steady and growing operational environment of our industry, the majority of our largest costs are fixed or increases our cap. As a result, we believe we are not only able to withstand the current inflationary environment, but we are able to continue growing our AFFO per share, creating additional value for our shareholders. In closing, we are very pleased with our first half of 2022. Our team performed well against a very strong demand environment. I expect more of the same throughout the rest of the year and into 2023. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success. I also want to take a brief moment to recognize and thank both Kurt Bagwell, our President of International and Tom Hunt, our General Council for their decades of service to SBA. Both will be retiring at the end of this year, but each has left an indelible mark on SBA and the industry. I appreciate their sacrifices and contributions and wish them all the best in retirement. And with that Moses, we are now ready for questions. Yeah, I think Batya, the most we could say about the trajectory is that the fourth quarter of this year we believe will be the highest growth rate of the year and we'll let you extrapolate what that means going forward. And obviously we'll give a full review when we give our 2023 guidance. Brendan, I'm going to let you take the churn question. Yeah, Rick, we've been kind of ballparking on our portfolio of at about $20 million to $30 million US over the next many years. This portfolio actually reduces our exposure to oil on a percentage basis in Brazil, but would probably add somewhere in the $3-ish million of incremental oil churn would be our current estimate. Yeah. That's -- obviously it's been trending down. Part of the reason it's trending down Rick is because as we've done amendments and had longer terms to some of our tenant leases, you amortize it over a longer period of time. So it's actually had a reducing effect. So it really is just a function of how much augmentation work we do that we get reimbursed for and which leases that relates to how much time they have. But I think based on the way that it's trended, that number that you just mentioned of $25 million or so is probably a reasonable estimate, but it's been higher in the past and it's been lower. So, we'll see how it goes, but, I think that's a reasonable estimate. Understand it for what it is. So it's not something we look to discourage but you can depend on us that it's always going to be clearly marked out. It's over the next several years. Some of it is specific to the timeframes that of the terms of those agreements, Simon and they're all spread out to different dates but you should assume over the next three years roughly on average, but it won't be even, it'll be certain amount each. A little bit. Yes. Yes, it was realized this quarter. It's basically there's a few different things in there, but it's essentially what we consider cash basis revenue, which is stuff that we're collecting kind of one off. Sometimes there's extra fees that are paid or holdover fees, things that are not part of the recurring ongoing lease. So we classify it as other, but the increase is really that we got more of that than we expected. So almost all of that is stuff that we realized in the second quarter. There may be a small amount of projected for the second half of the year, but most of it was actually realized. No real change, Nick. No real change that comes to mind. Well, the services revenue is pretty straightforward. It's just more activity, more stuff going and our services business is almost entirely gained gleaned from our own towers. So it's just a lot of activity, Phil. And in terms of the -- remember we report those growth rates on a trailing 12 month basis. So a lot of what you're going to see in our financial reports for the second or the third and the fourth quarter, we already know, it's already kind of on the books. So, that part of it there's much less risk, so to speak than those and as we move through the year as a calendar year company, the risk drops and drops and drops. So here we are in August, our year isn't entirely baked yet, but it's pretty close. Yeah. And so to your question on dish being a part of it, they're certainly a part of it because they've been a big part of our leasing activity success over the last really last year. And so the timing of when those leases commence is a driver. And so it's certainly a contributing factor to the increasing growth that we expect in Q3 and Q4. I think I'd like to save all that till my 2023 guidance Phil. Well internationally, recall and we talked about this last quarter, the data center we bought in Brazil. We are having more advanced discussions there around CRAN  and other carrier deployments that, we'll tie into owning a data center and data center expertise. So that's encouraging, but in terms of the edge itself, we're adding couple three, four, five, maybe as many as 10 new many facilities a quarter, but it's still we're not yet prepared to say the edge is here and it's at the tower site. It's all going in the right direction, but it still needs more time, certainly is still a ways off from being material. Now in terms of the services contributions, I believe in our 10-Q we disclose who our top services customers are. So I will accelerate that for you that, and it is T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish are going to be the top three, right. Brendan. Yeah, for this quarter Tmobile, certainly the number one. Yeah. Yeah. Well, a number of folks in addition to T-Mobile registered, I would agree with you only based on what I read, most folks expect T-Mobile to be the big winner and any kind of spectrum for us is new spectrum is going to prove valuable in one degree or another. Now, if it's folks who don't have existing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to deploy, that's going to generally mean new radios and antennas. So that can be a little more impactful than not, but just having more spectrum and greater densification that will permit is a good thing. So, I'm not really going to speculate as to who else is going to put in bids that ultimately win the day. We're just happy that there's another auction, a very valuable mid band spectrum that we know ultimately gets deployed. Yeah, I think there'll be opportunities. And I think when all of our customers talk about when this spectrum gets deployed, they they're generally talking about coverage and that's just really, the end of coverage is the beginning of densification and all the infill and other things that will ultimately be driven by consumer uptake of 5G apps and products. So when we think about these periods of additional investment, they have always in our history gone well beyond the dates that folks talk about achieving their pops, their desired pops coverage, because then you just -- then it gets to densification, which is much different. Yeah. And while we may be opportunistic David and raise the money, from somewhere else for purposes of our outlook, it assumes cash on hand and a revolver draw. Well, the short answer to your last question is yes. So that could vary very well happen and I'm sorry, what was color versus amendments and the mix in terms of a shift, if you kind of go back really the colo side of it in the US is heavily driven by Dish. And so as you have a little less dish contribution, you see the percentage shifting more towards amendments and I think with that, and the mix towards infill, as we talked about amendments will probably be trending higher as a percentage. Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. We had a great quarter and we look forward to our next report. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. Good evening. SBA continued building on our strong first quarter with an even better second quarter with across the board results ahead of our expectations and backlog supportive of an equally good or possibly even better second half of the year. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $580.2 million and cash site leasing revenues were $570.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were largely in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but we're a tailwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $3.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.4% over the second quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.7% of churn. On a gross basis same-tower growth was 8.1%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.1% on a gross basis and 4.1% on a net basis, including 3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was very strong again and incrementally higher than the first quarter of this year. In addition, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs remain very healthy as well. The combination of our strong second quarter leasing activity level and our backlogs have allowed us to increase our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease up. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 66% of our domestic bookings with 34% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Dish; represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.6% net, including 7.1% of churn or 12.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again and also higher than we saw in the first quarter. We continued to see strong customer activity levels in many of our markets, as well as increased contributions from inflation based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another particularly strong quarter. Same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 14.2% on a constant currency basis. International churn was elevated in the quarter as anticipated, due primarily to carrier consolidations and other customer financial challenges, mainly in Guatemala and Panama. During the second quarter, 80.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 13.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $459.6 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.9% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.2% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were impacted on a year-over-year basis by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $437.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.2% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.3%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the fifth quarter in a row with $71.8 million in revenue and $17.3 million of segment operating profit. We also continued to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record second quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong second quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $40 million. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $335.3 million. AFFO per share was $3.07 an increase of 16.3% over the second quarter of 2021. During the second quarter, we continue to expand our portfolio acquiring 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil, which we previously disclosed with our first quarter results for total cash consideration of $127.3 million. We also built 100 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 200 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $85 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract, by the end of the year. In addition, during the quarter, we entered into a contract with Grupo TorreSur or GTS to purchase their remaining approximately 2,600 tower sites in Brazil for $725 million. We anticipate closing on this acquisition during the fourth quarter of this year and expect these assets to produce approximately $68 million of tower cash flow during the first full year following closing, based on our current estimates of future exchange rates. These are assets we know well in a market we obviously know well, and this acquisition will be immediately accretive to AFFO per share upon closing. Jeff will share a little more about this acquisition in a moment. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years to land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now to the rest of the year, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics based on a combination of outperformance in the second quarter, strengthening activity levels in both services and leasing, lower churn expectations and anticipated contributions from the pending GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by weaker foreign exchange rates and higher interest costs from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. We are excited about the current operating environment and pleased with how our team has been able to execute in order to produce better than expected results and support our customers at a high level with all of their network initiatives. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who'll provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Well, clearly I'll take the last one first Mike. Clearly, 10.5 times is extremely attractive price that takes into account exactly that. We don't really believe any of the next revenue will stay on and we have heavily discounted the oil revenue as well in our underwriting. So yes, all that was taken into account when we arrived at the price. In terms of AT&T, I listened to their call and heard their comments and based on our observations in our markets, which are mostly suburban highway corridor and rural. I think the numbers that they were talking about mostly came from dense urban markets, which makes a lot of sense because that's how all new -- that's where all new generational upgrades start. So we still have in our opinion, a very, very long way to go with, AT&T and their C-band and 3.45 work and Dish is a very active contributor. They would represent most all of the new leases that we are signing domestically. So there will be some ebbs and flows as they work around their will have a -- they have already worked around their 2022 regulatory requirements and are now going to be working towards their 2023 regulatory requirements, but still a very, very active participant. Yeah, the churn is -- it is mostly you should think of it as rolling into next year or future year it's largely timing related as opposed to below our expectations. It's just the timing primarily around the Sprint, T-Mobile decommissioning is a little bit more deferred than the estimates that we had made, but we don't expect the total to really be any different. Yeah, it was well, last quarter we actually brought it down about $3 million and we brought it down about another $3 million this quarter. So this year is probably closer to '24 that's what's assumed in our numbers right now for '22, for 2022. And next year we're probably somewhere in the $15 million to $25 million range. It's a fairly wide range, but obviously there are some uncertainties around exact timing, but somewhere in that $20-ish million level. Yeah, it was the right time because the opportunity presented itself at a time and on terms where we thought it was very attractive for our future value creation. What's going on in Brazil right now is, they've got a fairly hawkish central bank. They have -- I think they're little bit ahead of the US in terms of their economy having, being dancing around a recession. The demand, notwithstanding that for cellular and 5G continues to mushroom in Brazil. You have, you know, this rationalization going on with the oil transaction for three carriers who now have bought a lot of new spectrum that needs to be deployed and are in a better market share position to do all that. So we like the dynamic a lot, Rick and we know these assets well and we know the sellers well, and all things kind of came together in the right way. Yeah. We're always going to disclose it very specifically, Rick, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This isa\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, no, I hear you. Yeah, I think as long as we can continue to produce the organic growth Simon, we're fine in the 7 to 7.5 times. But, if we don't find good things to buy, it'll obviously be trending lower. In terms of your first question, I think there are some breaks on the margins that are happening around the world in terms of seller and buyer expectations coming more together. But in this particular case, this was more a situation of these particular assets, our familiarity with them, the fact that it was the last tranche of towers that the seller had and needed to sell them to basically liquidate some funds and do some things that private equity needs to do. So I would attribute it more to this deal that I would a wholesale change in the buying environment. Although I do think that is improving. Yeah, I don't want to give the exact number but, there the oil, well, as Jeff said, we're assuming that all of the next revenue goes away. The total for oil and next tell is about 17%. So Nextel is roughly half of that. So you can probably do the math from there. Stuff that doesn't go in the $66 million bucket. Right because, we want to be careful as to how folks think about that year after year after year. Yeah. On GTS, as of right now, we plan to be opportunistic in the financing markets. That financing, we haven't been specific about that. We do have the capacity on our revolver and with the cash that we're generating from operations to handle it if necessary, but we do intend to be opportunistic. We do have a maturity. Our next step maturity actually comes up in March of next year and so that will be refinanced at some point between now and then, and there's capacity within our ABS structure to actually raise more money. So that might be a contributor. So we'll see how that goes. In the general sense of secured versus unsecured, I don't think they're obviously all up right now in terms of pricing. For us there's still availability and any of the markets that we typically use. So it's not a question of access, it's really just a question of pricing and so we intend to be take our time and be opportunistic. And as was mentioned in the script, we have other than this one maturity that I mentioned, which represents about 5% of our outstanding debt. We don't have any maturities for over two years. So we have the flexibility to be a little bit patient with that. But, I think you should expect we'll continue to use the secured markets as we have in the past. But a mix of both will likely be the path for us. Yeah. When you think about how this is going to go, and there'll be exceptions of course to this, but for the most part, the rollouts by T-Mobilem, Verizon and AT&T are going to be heavily amendment. For Dish it's going to be more colo. And then when we get to the densification part, Greg, you kind of lean towards amendment, but I believe that you will see I think a higher percentage of brand new leases when we get to the deification stage."

With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA started the year off with a very strong quarter with many of the results ahead of our internal expectations, and we continue to anticipate a solid performance throughout 2022.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $559.4 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $551.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were slightly ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, positively impacting revenues by approximately $2.3 million. They were also a tailwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $2.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.3% over the first quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.4%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 3.7% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was very strong again and materially higher than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at quarter end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the rest of 2022.  During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 55% of our domestic bookings, with 45% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7% net, including 4.8% of churn or 11.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again. And we continue to see increasing customer activity levels in many of our markets. International growth continued to climb higher, in part due to increased inflation of -- I'm sorry, in part due to increased inflation-based escalators.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we also had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.3% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 82.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.  Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $445.3 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 68% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were modestly impacted by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $423.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.2%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.  During the first quarter, our services business produced record results for the fourth quarter in a row with $60.3 million in revenue and $14.6 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlog, finishing the quarter at the highest level in our company's history. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for increased contributions from our services business throughout the balance of 2022. AFFO in the first quarter was $324.3 million. AFFO per share was $2.96, an increase of 14.7% over the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 1,807 communication sites for total cash consideration of $215.4 million, which includes 1,445 sites for $176.1 million closed on January 4 and our previously disclosed acquisition from Airtel Tanzania.  We also built 86 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 358 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $127.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of a stand-alone datacenter in Sao Paulo, Brazil for cash consideration of approximately $49 million. The datacenter currently produces approximately $8.3 million in annual revenue and $3.5 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This acquisition was done in support of our continuing evaluation and efforts around the potential expansion of mobile edge computing to our tower sites. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $8.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now. This afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook for most of our key metrics from the outlook we previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. These increases are partially due to revised expectations for better foreign currency exchange rates than previously assumed. These FX changes have contributed an increase to our revenue outlook of approximately $21 million and our adjusted EBITDA outlook of approximately $13 million.  In addition, we have increased the midpoint of our outlook for site leasing revenue by $17 million on a constant currency basis. This increase is due to several factors, including lower domestic churn impact during 2022 as a result of longer decommissioning cycles as compared to SBA's initial estimates, higher international CPI-based escalators, higher reimbursable and miscellaneous onetime revenue items and contributions from acquisitions completed during and after the quarter, all of which was partially offset by increased churn in Panama. On April 6, Digicel Panama, one of our primary customers in Panama, announced that they intend to apply for voluntary liquidation and withdraw from the telecommunications market in Panama. While there are likely many developments and steps to take place over the coming months, we have increased our projected 2022 churn impact by approximately $6 million to account for the loss of all leasing revenue from Digicel Panama for the balance of the year.  Notwithstanding this one churn issue, as noted, there were a number of very positive developments in our business over the last two months that have resulted in a significant increase in our full year revenue outlook. In addition to the leasing benefits I just mentioned, we also raised the midpoint of our services revenue outlook by $27 million or over 13% due to our very strong first quarter results and the continuing strength of our backlogs. The strength of both our leasing and services business has allowed us to raise the midpoint of our full year outlook for AFFO per share by $0.24.  Our full year 2022 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to continue to optimize our balance sheet. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3 times, well within our target, notwithstanding a substantial amount of capital allocated in the first quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3 times, the highest in the company's history.  As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.6 years, and the interest rate on 92% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $590 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $431.6 million at an average price per share of $332. Included in these amounts, subsequent to our previous disclosure of share buybacks in our fourth quarter earnings release, is the repurchasing of 253,000 shares for $81.6 million at an average price per share of $322.10. All the shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2022, were 107.8 million, compared to 109.3 million at March 31, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%.  In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.9 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, which is an increase of 22.4% over the second quarter of last year. It's payable on June 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 19, 2022. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Stoops : Thanks, Mark. And good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had a very strong start to the year with strong operating and financial results, again generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. Our better-than-expected results combined with continued elevated activity levels with our customers have set us up well for the balance of this year. We have increased our outlook for full year revenues by $65 million and AFFO per share by $0.24. These upward revisions are indicative of the positive environment we are currently in.  The U.S. market remains particularly strong. Each of our U.S. carrier customers remained busy during the quarter, signing up new leases and amendments and generally investing in the build-out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T increased their 5G-related signings with us, with particular focus on C-band-oriented deployments. And DISH continued signing up new lease agreements actively in support of their nationwide 5G network build-out. These carrier activity levels also drove meaningful U.S. services results where we produced record services revenue and margin results for the fourth quarter in a row. Our backlogs also continue to replenish and support our confidence in continued strong performance. Internationally, we had another strong quarter, finishing ahead of our internal expectations for organic tower leasing and new build activity in most of our markets. During the first quarter, we signed up 49% of new international revenue through new leases and 51% through amendments to existing leases. Coupled with increased escalators due to higher consumer price indexes in many of our markets, this leasing activity drove some of our strongest organic international leasing revenue growth in years.  We are also off to a good start integrating our new Tanzanian operations, and we continue to build new sites and tower backlogs in the Philippines. In addition, we recently acquired a new datacenter in Sao Paulo that we believe will allow us to more fully explore the potential for tower edge mobile computing in Brazil. We believe this datacenter can act as a hub for tower edge datacenters and C-RAN deployments based on discussions with some of our carrier customers in Brazil. Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we continue to believe that 2022 will be a very good year. In addition to our strong operational performance during the first quarter, we also continued to execute well with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We meaningfully increased our dividend and invested in significant asset additions as well as significant stock repurchases. We were able to make these investments while maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at 7.3 times, right in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 times, and our weighted average cost of debt remains largely fixed and at our all-time low of 2.6%.  We believe our ability to manage leverage while continuing to invest in our business is critical during this current time of more broadly increasing interest rates. We are well positioned to continue to grow our business, but also to weather any kind of challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with our start to 2022. I'm going to keep my comments brief as I believe our results and increased outlook tell the story very well. I believe the rest of the year will be similar to the first quarter, excellent blocking and tackling on our part against a very strong demand environment. We are in a great industry during a time of increasing organic growth, and we are more financially healthy than at any time in our history. We have great confidence in the balance of the year and look forward to helping our customers achieve their ambitious network goals. I want to finish by again thanking our team members for their commitment and contributions to our success.  And with that, Colin, we are now ready for questions.\nQ - Amir Razban : Hi. This is Amir for Phil. Two, if I may. So you guys mentioned lower expectations for churn this year. You reconsidered the timing of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger revenues falling off. Can you give us an update on maybe how your expectations for long-term churn with them have changed?  And then secondly, is the datacenter acquisition within guidance? And does this kind of indicate SBAC is leaning more into the mobile edge compute opportunity? Thank you. \nBrendan Cavanagh : Just, Amir, on the churn question, we don't have any real changes to our long-term expectations. What you're seeing is a slight shift in timing. So a little bit less of an expectation in this year, but ultimately, those incremental dollars would just move to next year. So what we've given out in the past in terms of expectations each year is generally the same as it's been before.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the datacenter question, I think it's really no change in our activity, trajectory and direction around mobile edge that we've been talking about now for, I guess, at least a year. I would look at this as an extension of what we're doing in the U.S. to our largest international market, Brazil. And we think it will continue our learning and interactions with our customers.  And I would say so far that the results are encouraging, and we continue to believe that we will be benefited and that the mobile edge will in fact have value created or create value at our tower sites. And we think these datacenter investments, albeit modest, are going to help us get there.\nBrendan Cavanagh : And it is in guidance, too, the datacenter.\nAmir Razban : Okay. Great. And one more, if I could. How prepared do you think you are versus like an AMT that has that CoreSite asset for them? Do you -- how do you kind of view that?\nJeffrey Stoops : Well, prepared for what? I mean I think it all -- it all remains to be seen how robust the edge at the tower site business. And that's what we're focused on. So from that perspective, I think our measured approach is the right one for us.\nAmir Razban : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery : Great. Good afternoon. Jeff, thanks for all the comments. Great to hear the momentum in the business. I wonder if you could talk about the sustainability of this. We've heard from both Verizon and T-Mobile that CapEx peaks this year and then falls fairly sharply. And how do you think about your medium-term outlook given some of those commentary? And perhaps relatedly, we've seen very strong fixed wireless results. How do you think that might impact some of their builds, some of their densification over the coming years? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think it is going to be a multiyear endeavor, Simon, particularly keeping in mind that the C-band clears in phases over years. So there's really going to be multiple years still ahead where C-band deployments are going to have to take place. I take our customers' comments at face value.  I can tell you, though, that there's a lot of work to be done. And at least on the C-band deployment side of things, they are just in their infancy. It can only be a multiyear endeavor. So I'm not sure how that will be impacted, if at all, by the fixed wireless initiative and the spend there. It's really -- obviously, one is primarily a mobility product, and the other is a location-driven product, but I don't -- we've not seen any signs that the success in the fixed wireless area is going to impact the mobility spend.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRick Prentiss : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, I want to follow up on some of the comments about the international churn. You mentioned you called out the Digicel Panama. How much of that should roll into next year, though, if you say that's the impact for the rest of this year? How much should we think about that kind of tail hitting us next year? And update us as far as what's going on with Oi.  We've seen obviously a lot of press releases. It looks like some transactions are finally coming to pass in Brazil.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. So the $6 million of incremental churn for Digital represents about three quarters. So there'll be another couple of million dollars into next year. There's probably also a little bit of additional, Rick, because we were already assuming some digital churn previously, not associated with this liquidation, just as they were shutting down certain sites because they were obviously already having some issues. So there's probably an extra $1 million or so in addition that would flow into next year.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the Oi situation, Rick, the sale has closed. Oi Mobility. Wireless has been sold in parts to Claro, TIM and Vivo. They've all got some cell sites. They've all got some subscribers. Only Tim and Vivo got spectrum, however, because Claro was already at their regulatory prescribed limits.  And where it all stands right now is that each of the recipients or winning bidders or the three remaining need to prepare and file with the regulators various plans and answers to some conditions and restrictions that were put on the approvals. That has not happened yet. We'll be watching with great interest what those filings will be. But also keep in mind now we have the 5G auctions done in Brazil and the spectrum ready to be released and with some time limits on deployment at least around the major capital cities.\nRick Prentiss : Okay. And you also -- obviously, CPI is benefiting escalators. How should we think about how often they get updated? What's -- where are we at in the process of you guys? Maybe also just update on where you're seeing CPI in Brazil and South Africa. But just help us understand the time line as far as where the benefit and escalator is at currently where it might head? And also, is there anything on the cost side?\nBrendan Cavanagh : The CPI in Brazil right now for us -- for our average for the year went to about 9%. The actual rate is higher than that. It's closer to 11%, I believe, right now. And the timing is really tied to when the leases individually escalate. There are some larger concentrations because of some of the acquisitions that we did. Those tend to be in the fourth quarter and the second quarter. But really, it's just a function of the time that the anniversary date of each individual lease and what the CPI looks like on a year-over-year basis at that point in time. \nJeffrey Stoops : Keep in mind on the expense side, Rick, the ground leases, which are the single largest component in Brazil, are a pass-through item. So we have that protection. Where we are likely to see the impact is, of course, on the labor side. And we will see that because of the way the Brazilian employment laws are written. But again, I would point out that, given the operating leverage in the business, the percentage of employee costs against revenue is extremely small. So we have some great elasticity to be able to absorb any employee-related CPI increases.\nRick Prentiss : Make sense. Thanks for that. Have a good day. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. I guess first one maybe for you, Brendan or Mark. With respect to the guidance expectations for rate movements, for the rest of the year and the impact on the net change in the updated '22 guide, could you kind of give us a sense as to what you were originally baking in and what maybe is net incremental probably a headwind presumably on the 8% remaining variable rate debt. And then the second piece would be just on the service revenue kind of outlook. Obviously, pretty healthy activity across the board. We've talked in the past about the margin mix, whether it's earlier stage, it's more human capital, higher margin, later stage is more labor-related and lower margin. Where are we in that curve? And where do you see margins in that business going?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. On the rate impacts, the impact is primarily due to: one, an assumed increase in CPI rates; and two, slightly more of our revolver being drawn during the course of the year associated with some of the incremental spend that we've just incurred or have under contract. So if you look at our CapEx guidance, it's up a little bit so that, that requires that along with the share repurchases that we did that weren't assumed before that we have a little bit more capital drawn and because it's floating rate and the CPI is increasing. That's really driving the increase in our net cash interest expense guidance that we gave. Otherwise, there's really no changes to that.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. On the services, Dave, the biggest issue is not so much the margin inside each of our two services segments. It's really the mix of the two. Site acquisition has historically been the higher-margin business. Construction has been a lower-margin business. I will tell you, though, that the margins that we're currently experiencing in both segments relative to our history are very good, maybe pushing all-time highs. But really, the biggest driver of where margins come out, it's the mix between site acquisition and construction services, although we -- again, we're very, very happy with where each of those segments are performing. One of the ramifications of a big services quarter, though, given the fact that it is a lower-margin business, is its impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin. So for those of you who are wondering why that is where it is this quarter, it's really because of the large amount of services revenue that we booked this quarter.\nDavid Barden : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Jeff. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. \nNick Del Deo : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. First, kind of turning back to Brazil and the Oi situation, can you talk at all about the conversations you've had with customers? And anything they've said about their plans to invest behind the assets they're acquiring? And are any of the initial goals that they've laid out for site decommissionings, I think at least TIM has talked about that, have those been consistent with your expectations?\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think we're still of the same mind in terms of the aggregate exposure, which -- Mark, jump in here and make sure I say the right numbers.\nMark DeRussy: $20 million to $30 million over the life is what we think our exposure is.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yes. So nothing's really changed there, Nick. As what we have seen in the U.S. that to actually migrate customers and truly decommission sites, it's a little more complex. It takes a little more time than people think. Now that's really a timing comment. We don't -- we think the ultimate numbers will be what Brendan just said. But we really don't have any specific instructions from them as of this point. We do expect that, as the year progresses, we will begin to get more clarity on the timing and final amount that we will be looking at.  But they are -- on the other side, the 3 now nationwide carriers are all active to varying degrees with the new spectrum deployments.\nNick Del Deo : Okay, okay. That's great. And then maybe turning to the datacenter topic. I think, to date, you've described what you're doing is buying assets to learn about the business, learn about the edge opportunity. Do you feel like you currently own a sufficient number of datacenters in the U.S. to fulfill that goal? Or should we expect you to pick up some more in the future maybe in different geographies or different size or something like that?\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think, as our experimentation and learning process continues to move in a positive direction, it would not be impossible to see us buy a couple more datacenters, but I don't think we would ever get to the point where you would see -- I mean it won't ever get close to 1% of enterprise value, I don't believe.\nNick Del Deo : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Jeff. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. First question for me was, curious if you could unpack the merger churn in the U.S. from Sprint and T-Mobile that was within the first quarter results as well as what's in the guidance for 2022.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. What's in the guidance for 2022 is now approximately $27 million. I think we had previously told you $30 million. Obviously, we lowered our full year number by $3 million. The first quarter piece of that, I don't know -- let me check that and get back to you, and I'll mention on the call if we are done with you before then.\nMichael Rollins : Sure. And then just as you're thinking about the year domestically. Just curious how you're thinking about that 3.7% net growth that you did in 1Q relative to the full year guide. If I'm calculating the numbers right on Slide 4, I think it is, it also looks like for the full year organically you're looking for about that amount, but with churn possibly ramping higher as a contribution.  So just kind of curious how you're thinking about the growth moving through the year and the net and what the contribution that may be layered in for DISH and AT&T as you're just thinking about that full year growth expectation for 2022.\nJeffrey Stoops : Well, I know, Brendan, you could get to the net, but I know that the gross number, Mike, we expect to grow sequentially as we move through the year.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. We do expect the growth to move up sequentially. We also expect the churn node to move up sequentially during the year. Obviously, as indicated by the first quarter shift here, there's some potential that our expectations around timing are off on the churn, but our expectation and what's in our guidance shows that it's increasing. So the net will be a modest increase, maybe flat to modest increase quarter-over-quarter going through the year. In terms of the mix, I don't think we want to get into the individual carriers that make up the mix. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that on a lot of -- the last few quarters, a lot of the lease-up, one of the significant contributors there was DISH in terms of their new agreements. So obviously, they would be a nice component of that growth, but all the carriers have contributed to the lease-up activity. So they're all in the mix.\nMichael Rollins : And how does the -- when we think about the longer-term leverage targets for the business, do you have a rule of thumb in terms of rates to a certain level and leverage to be a certain level? Or is your view of leverage less dependent on the rate environment within  \nJeffrey Stoops : Well, clearly, there would be a rate level which would -- and I -- and I don't really want to get pinned down on what that is. But clearly, there would be a rate at which we would look at different leverage levels.  But beyond that, Mike, what we're looking at is our dividend, our dividend payout ratio, how much our EBITDA growth looks to be. So I mean we really do try and be very thoughtful and take into account everything that should be taken into account.  But I mean on an absolute basis, of course, there would be some interest rate that if we thought it was going to be maintained and sustained for long periods of time, if it were materially higher than where we are today, will cause us to revisit our leverage targets.\nBrendan Cavanagh : And Mike, before you go, let me follow back up on your question about how much Sprint in the first quarter. It was approximately $4 million of impact in the quarter, so a little over 1% of the roughly 2.7%.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks very much. \nOperator: And next, we go to the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to get a little bit of an update on the MLAs. And I think what we'd all kind of could really use maybe a little bit more color on how much activity is falling into those MLAs versus out of those MLAs with the same customers that actually sign them. Can you just give us a little bit of color or more color than normal on what the mix of in versus out of MLA looks like?\nJeffrey Stoops : Well, I think it's 100% for every customer that we have an MLA with is somehow touched by the MLA. So that's DISH, Verizon and T-Mobile. And then we don't have one with AT&T. It's not really a situation where some of it's covered and some of it's not per carrier.\nSami Badri : Got it. And --\nJeffrey Stoops : And just to be clear, our MLAs, though, are still based on specific activity from those customers and equipment specificity. They're not just a broad open-ended thing.\nSami Badri : Got it. The other thing is, last quarter, you stated that the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum would require incremental radios to C-band. Do you still hold that view?\nJeffrey Stoops : We do. Although I know that they're working on an integrated one as well, which will come out at some point.\nSami Badri : Got it. And then just to be clear, right, just the -- if they do work on an integrated radio, that does still have scope for amendment because they're riding on two separate different spectrum bands? Or is there a different type of negotiation now take place if they came out with that?\nJeffrey Stoops : Well, it will be primarily driven by what the equipment looks like and how it stacks up compared to: a, if anything is coming off, that's a swap. If it's not, then we would look at the equipment and price it accordingly based on height, weight, wind load.\nSami Badri : Got it. Thank you for the color. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Greg Williams with Cowen.\nGreg Williams : What multiples look like, given the rising rate environment, private multiples and the geopolitical landscape by region generally? Second question just on the record service revenues. Are you seeing any labor or logistic bottlenecks in the current environment and keeping up with this record activity?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Greg, I think we missed your first question. You didn't -- you were -- the first part of that cut off.\nGreg Williams : Sorry. The M&A landscape, what multiples are looking like through the regions?\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah, they're not increasing. So that's -- we're thankful for that. There are some signs that the current interest rate environment is going to have a depressive effect on prices. As you know, Greg, it takes a while for current market conditions to factor through to private market sellers. However, it is headed in that direction where, obviously, rates should and I think will impact price over time.  On the supply side of equipment and labor, I don't want to jinx things, but as of today, we are not seeing any material impact on either the supply chain side or the labor side for our business.\nGreg Williams : Thank you. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : Great. Thanks for the questions. Jeff, for the vast majority of SBA's history is a U.S. tower operator. Your fixed escalators, which are generally, I think, in the low 3% range have exceeded inflation. And that's obviously not the circumstances were today and who knows what the long-term view is going to be. But I'm wondering if we've been in an inflationary environment long enough for you to see any impact on your business or maybe to change how you think about it.  So just as an example, I'm wondering, is there any increased mutual interest between you and your carrier customers maybe finally moving to a CPI-based escalator model in your leases. If you are doing build-to-suits in this environment, are you actually still doing that at the historical escalator? Or is that changing?  And maybe just bigger picture, if we're not likely to see a change in the escalation model and we do remain in an inflationary environment, could that suggest that you may have a preference for continuing to invest increasingly outside the U.S. where you can actually develop and acquire towers that can escalate in line with CPI? Thank you. \nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. I think I'd characterize the state of the escalator issue with our customers, Brett, as one where I think certainty and a fixed number benefits both sides. Even though, clearly, in a year like this, with a fixed escalator, one party wins, the other loses, but that's a very temporary kind of condition. And over time, the Fed has a mandate to reduce inflation back to 2% or less.  So I really don't know that there's a lot of appetite on either side to change that around really because if you have a very, very big inflation year, the person on the CPI end of that, whether it's us on ground leases or our customers on the tenant leases, they're not going to be happy. So I think we're pretty satisfied with the state of the world as it currently exists. And I don't think -- we consciously are making international decisions relative to U.S. decisions with any kind of belief that this will be better because we get CPI escalators. The traditional economic theory is if there's higher inflation in those markets, the currency is going to trade off.  So we don't really think that, that is a reason why to favor international over the U.S. The reason we go internationally is because we have a capital allocation and a target leverage, which we think is one of our principal creators of shareholder value, and we have been able to find enough to do in the U.S. And we found some very, very good things to do internationally, and I think that will continue to be the primary motivation.\nBrett Feldman : If I could ask just 1 quick follow-up question. I believe in the U.S., what we've typically believed in the U.S. is that the escalation clauses on your ground rent was reasonably similar to what you see on the tower side, so kind of a fixed low 3% escalator. Is that the right understanding? Or could we see a mismatch at any point over the coming quarters?\nJeffrey Stoops : No, no. We've generally matched off -- when I say generally, I mean we've -- substantially, every single U.S. tower that is ground leased has a fixed escalator. And they typically average less than our average tenant escalator. So we feel -- and of course, you know that's our single largest source of expense and getting to the tower cash flow line is the ground leases. So we feel pretty well protected there, Brett.\nBrett Feldman : Thanks. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk : Hey, Jeff, this first question, I'm going to send over to Brendan. You said to a prior question that Sprint churn was $4 million. Maybe if you were rounding up there, that implies, I think, a churn rate for the rest of your domestic business that I couldn't find that low, unless I went back, I guess, for a quarter or two in 2018 when it was like 1.7-1.5 for second quarter. Is this a sustainable number? Because that's just much lower than we've seen for several years.\nBrendan Cavanagh : No, I don't -- I mean I think it's -- so that what's left is about 1.5, maybe 1.6% if you exclude the Sprint piece. And I don't think that's lower. I mean we've actually been -- we've been much lower than that. If you go back a couple of years ago where we were below 1%, but we've historically been somewhere in that usually between 1% and 2%, sometimes lower. So I don't think it's abnormal.\nMark DeRussy: Well, it's Mark. The absolute dollars, the numerator in that calculation, has been flat for a couple of quarters now, which is -- as a percentage is going down.\nWalter Piecyk : Got you. But --\nJeffrey Stoops : I think there's a different reason. I think, Walt, what you're looking at is kind of the gross churn that historically includes -- has always included some kind of consolidation churn.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. Maybe that's -- obviously, we've had Metro Leap and Clearwire. We had iDEN-related churns.\nWalter Piecyk : I'm saying, like if you look at all these years passed, you've always had something setting in there. Maybe you're like actual core, core stuff, which you don't really report, was that low. But as far as reportable churn numbers, it's never been that low that I can say. Because you don't break -- you haven't broken out --\nJeffrey Stoops : Apples to apples, you have to include the Sprint.\nWalter Piecyk : I mean that's -- so that was my second question, which is $4 million is fine. But if you look at $30 million for the year, you still have to step that Sprint component up pretty at some point. Like is it -- was part of this just the delay in turning off CDMA? Which quarter do you think you're really going to see? I mean, obviously, I think last year you were doing like two a quarter, somewhere in that ballpark. So four is not like it's no step-up, but are you expecting a larger step-up in Q2 or Q3, do you think?\nBrendan Cavanagh : We're expecting a larger step up as we move throughout the year. So I mean, just incrementally, I think stepping up because it just builds over time. But it's really dependent on when those leases turn down, termination dates and everything else. \nJeffrey Stoops : And it's quite possible that you see it increase each succeeding quarter.\nWalter Piecyk : Okay. And then just same basic question for amendments in colo. You think the target is whatever 60 something for the year, 65%, I think. That would imply a much bigger step-up sequentially than maybe what we saw in first quarter. Any sense on kind of when you're going to see a more material step-up from quarter-to-quarter? Or do you think it's going to be somewhat linear from here?\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah. No, it's going to step up, but I think mostly in the second half of the year. There'll be a modest step-up is our expectation next quarter and then more material into the third and then even further into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino : Hey. Jeff, going back to the M&A conversation, you mentioned multiples aren't increasing, but I think it's fair to say that they're rich today. And we've seen some deal terms on a few recent transactions that really appear to benefit the MNO sellers. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand how are you guys competing for deals now that your peers are bidding more aggressively. And has that caused you to adjust your underwriting at all?\nBrendan Cavanagh : No. We don't adjust our underwriting. We may do fewer deals, David. But if you look at the history of what we've done, we like what we've done, and we'll continue to exercise the same discipline.  And I think when you -- if you really understand what we're about, it's about creating value for our shareholders. There aren't particularly great as we see them strategic benefits of just being big in a bunch of different countries. We are much more interested in the financial characteristics and investment goals of each and every transaction. And we lose a lot, but we get enough to generally satisfy our 5% to 10% portfolio growth goals. And we're going to continue to operate that way.\nDavid Guarino : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe switching gears on the '22 guide. I was wondering is there any conservatism in your exchange rate forecasting for the Brazilian real? It looks like your full year guidance is below where the current exchange rate is, and we've got eight months left in the year. So I just wanted to know, how do you guys think about forecasting exchange rates?\nBrendan Cavanagh : We typically will use whatever the forwards are that you would generally pull from Bloomberg, some sort of average of a number of institutions that published projections. The one thing I can assure you of, David, is that we will be wrong on what we assume. I don't know whether we'll be wrong to the positive or the negative, but it's very hard to nail down. So we use what the experts are saying at any given time. But even since we kind of put our numbers together, which is at the end of last week, just in the last 2 days, we've seen the currency weakened relative to the dollar. So it's a little bit closer. So you -- basically, if you look at Brazil, our average for the balance of the year that we've assumed is essentially 5:1. And I think today, it ended up 4 88 or something like that. So it's fairly close to what the spot rate is.\nDavid Guarino : Okay. I appreciate the email, and thanks for that. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. So wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from DISH. I mean they publicly said they think they're about six months behind where they originally expected it to be. So just wondering if either the actual site construction when they hang equipment or the date certain under your contract with them would have much of an impact on your assumed leasing outlook for the year.  And then just more broadly, are you seeing their leasing concentrated in just a few markets? Or is it pretty broadly distributed across your portfolio today? Thanks. \nJeffrey Stoops : I could tell you that the activity level is pretty broadly distributed. And we do have a construct with DISH where once the lease is signed, revenue recognition for us begins at either a construction milestone or a date certain. And it's really the -- to actually look at all that and synthesize that and turn it into guidance is a bit of an art. So there'll be some possibilities that things move around there.  But for the most part, as we move through the year, things are known with a greater degree of certainty. So there's some opportunities for some movement. But for the most part, we feel pretty, pretty good about DISH's contribution. In terms of your comment about them being behind by six-- I mean maybe that's their own internal goals and projections, but I would repeat what we've said now for, I think, the better part of the year, which is they're very active, actually busier with us than we thought they would be for a rolling 12-month period. And they continue to be very, very busy and driving hard towards satisfying their June 2023 regulatory obligations.\nEric Luebchow : Great. Appreciate the color. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBrandon Nispel : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking questions. Maybe two, one follow-up though. Could you share what the backlog of lease applications was? What was that up this quarter? And if we just held that flat looking at the comparables in sort of the second and third quarter, what would that growth rate look like?  Then secondly, following up on Walt's question, it looks like you had about $12.6 million in U.S. organic growth this quarter on that 6.4%. Do you still think you can get to a low $20 million number exiting this year? And then is that a reasonable number to run rate into 2023? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Okay. On the backlog question, just to be clear on how we evaluate backlog for our leasing business, we're looking at the number of applications for new leases and amendments. Obviously, the pricing may vary depending on exactly what they do and sometimes that pricing has to be negotiated.  So it's not necessarily dollar-based. So I think I can't -- the number of applications is up. So when we say it's up, that's what we're referring to. So I can't really give you a -- what would the lease-up be if it were the same for the last few quarters. On the leasing dollars question in the fourth quarter, we do think we can get to the low-20s by the end of the year. As to whether that would be a run rate going forward is partially dependent on activity levels for the balance of this year, which we think will remain fairly strong. But as of today, I can't comment on what next year's number will be.\nBrandon Nispel : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. \nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nMatt Niknam : Just two quick ones, if I could. First, on M&A. I know you mentioned, I think, 358 sites acquired are under contract as of the end of the quarter. Any color you can share in terms of where they're located and when they're expected to close?  And then secondly, on the dividend payout ratio, I know you mentioned in the release that you're still under 25%. And I know you've talked about 20% annual growth the next several years. Any sort of update in terms of where you'd like to get that payout ratio to over time? Thanks. \nJeffrey Stoops : Well, we like it low because it gives us plenty of opportunities, including stock repurchases, which we think -- I think the execution and the allocation that we have, including setting the dividend really has served our shareholders well. So -- but at the same time, Matt, we want to continue to be an industry leader in terms of our dividend growth rates, which is why we set things to start at a low level.  So really, it's kind of the balance of those two which will ultimately drive where we set the dividend going forward, but I think you would agree at 25 -- less than a 25% payout ratio, we have a lot of room to increase the dividend materially in the years ahead. What was your first question?\nBrendan Cavanagh : M&A under contract mix. It's largely international. There is some domestic and some international. Was there more to the question?\nMatt Niknam : Any color you can share in terms of country or region, if possible?\nJeffrey Stoops : They're all existing markets.\nMatt Niknam : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. \nOperator:  And we do have a question from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC.\nJon Atkin : Was interested in talking a little bit about other types of infrastructure. You did the PG&E deal. There's rooftops, but on kind of non-conventional macro towers and opportunities you see within that segment? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. We continue to pursue a variety of different things, Jon. We have a growing indoor DAS business. We have a growing connected venues business where we get in and actually kind of build out the telecommunications infrastructure in new developments. We have added some rooftop sites for sure. And we have picked up now three datacenters.  None of that stuff comes close to being anywhere near material compared to the basic macro tower business. And while we are seeing good return on invested capital in all these areas, and we will continue to look at them and believe that we're picking areas that will scale over time. I mean we are, for all intents and purposes, for the foreseeable future we are a macro tower company.\nJon Atkin : So alternatives like rooftops, transmission lines, utility?\nJeffrey Stoops : We're buying rooftops. We are developing rooftops. We're playing in pretty much all the areas other than fiber, outdoor small cells on a big basis and undersea cable. But none of it is -- gets to the point where it's going to occupy a material portion of our financial results in the foreseeable future.  So the question then, I guess, should be, why are you doing it? And the answer is, well, because of where we are, who we are and what we've done over the years, we do get a lot of ancillary opportunities. And these are good assets, exclusive assets that are going to produce for us a good return on invested capital and are generally pursued and occupied by folks who are otherwise engaged in the macro tower business.\nJon Atkin : Thanks very much. \nJeffrey Stoops : Yeah. \nOperator: And we have no further lines in queue at this time.\nJeffrey Stoops : Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us for what you heard was a great first quarter. And we look forward to reporting continued success as we move through this year. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference call for today. Again, thank you very much for your participation and for using the AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. And good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had a very strong start to the year with strong operating and financial results, again generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. Our better-than-expected results combined with continued elevated activity levels with our customers have set us up well for the balance of this year. We have increased our outlook for full year revenues by $65 million and AFFO per share by $0.24. These upward revisions are indicative of the positive environment we are currently in.  The U.S. market remains particularly strong. Each of our U.S. carrier customers remained busy during the quarter, signing up new leases and amendments and generally investing in the build-out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T increased their 5G-related signings with us, with particular focus on C-band-oriented deployments. And DISH continued signing up new lease agreements actively in support of their nationwide 5G network build-out. These carrier activity levels also drove meaningful U.S. services results where we produced record services revenue and margin results for the fourth quarter in a row. Our backlogs also continue to replenish and support our confidence in continued strong performance. Internationally, we had another strong quarter, finishing ahead of our internal expectations for organic tower leasing and new build activity in most of our markets. During the first quarter, we signed up 49% of new international revenue through new leases and 51% through amendments to existing leases. Coupled with increased escalators due to higher consumer price indexes in many of our markets, this leasing activity drove some of our strongest organic international leasing revenue growth in years.  We are also off to a good start integrating our new Tanzanian operations, and we continue to build new sites and tower backlogs in the Philippines. In addition, we recently acquired a new datacenter in Sao Paulo that we believe will allow us to more fully explore the potential for tower edge mobile computing in Brazil. We believe this datacenter can act as a hub for tower edge datacenters and C-RAN deployments based on discussions with some of our carrier customers in Brazil. Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we continue to believe that 2022 will be a very good year. In addition to our strong operational performance during the first quarter, we also continued to execute well with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We meaningfully increased our dividend and invested in significant asset additions as well as significant stock repurchases. We were able to make these investments while maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at 7.3 times, right in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5 times, and our weighted average cost of debt remains largely fixed and at our all-time low of 2.6%.  We believe our ability to manage leverage while continuing to invest in our business is critical during this current time of more broadly increasing interest rates. We are well positioned to continue to grow our business, but also to weather any kind of challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with our start to 2022. I'm going to keep my comments brief as I believe our results and increased outlook tell the story very well. I believe the rest of the year will be similar to the first quarter, excellent blocking and tackling on our part against a very strong demand environment. We are in a great industry during a time of increasing organic growth, and we are more financially healthy than at any time in our history. We have great confidence in the balance of the year and look forward to helping our customers achieve their ambitious network goals. I want to finish by again thanking our team members for their commitment and contributions to our success.  And with that, Colin, we are now ready for questions. Yeah. On the datacenter question, I think it's really no change in our activity, trajectory and direction around mobile edge that we've been talking about now for, I guess, at least a year. I would look at this as an extension of what we're doing in the U.S. to our largest international market, Brazil. And we think it will continue our learning and interactions with our customers.  And I would say so far that the results are encouraging, and we continue to believe that we will be benefited and that the mobile edge will in fact have value created or create value at our tower sites. And we think these datacenter investments, albeit modest, are going to help us get there. Well, prepared for what? I mean I think it all -- it all remains to be seen how robust the edge at the tower site business. And that's what we're focused on. So from that perspective, I think our measured approach is the right one for us. Yeah. I think it is going to be a multiyear endeavor, Simon, particularly keeping in mind that the C-band clears in phases over years. So there's really going to be multiple years still ahead where C-band deployments are going to have to take place. I take our customers' comments at face value.  I can tell you, though, that there's a lot of work to be done. And at least on the C-band deployment side of things, they are just in their infancy. It can only be a multiyear endeavor. So I'm not sure how that will be impacted, if at all, by the fixed wireless initiative and the spend there. It's really -- obviously, one is primarily a mobility product, and the other is a location-driven product, but I don't -- we've not seen any signs that the success in the fixed wireless area is going to impact the mobility spend. Yeah. On the Oi situation, Rick, the sale has closed. Oi Mobility. Wireless has been sold in parts to Claro, TIM and Vivo. They've all got some cell sites. They've all got some subscribers. Only Tim and Vivo got spectrum, however, because Claro was already at their regulatory prescribed limits.  And where it all stands right now is that each of the recipients or winning bidders or the three remaining need to prepare and file with the regulators various plans and answers to some conditions and restrictions that were put on the approvals. That has not happened yet. We'll be watching with great interest what those filings will be. But also keep in mind now we have the 5G auctions done in Brazil and the spectrum ready to be released and with some time limits on deployment at least around the major capital cities. Keep in mind on the expense side, Rick, the ground leases, which are the single largest component in Brazil, are a pass-through item. So we have that protection. Where we are likely to see the impact is, of course, on the labor side. And we will see that because of the way the Brazilian employment laws are written. But again, I would point out that, given the operating leverage in the business, the percentage of employee costs against revenue is extremely small. So we have some great elasticity to be able to absorb any employee-related CPI increases. Yeah. On the services, Dave, the biggest issue is not so much the margin inside each of our two services segments. It's really the mix of the two. Site acquisition has historically been the higher-margin business. Construction has been a lower-margin business. I will tell you, though, that the margins that we're currently experiencing in both segments relative to our history are very good, maybe pushing all-time highs. But really, the biggest driver of where margins come out, it's the mix between site acquisition and construction services, although we -- again, we're very, very happy with where each of those segments are performing. One of the ramifications of a big services quarter, though, given the fact that it is a lower-margin business, is its impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin. So for those of you who are wondering why that is where it is this quarter, it's really because of the large amount of services revenue that we booked this quarter. Yeah. I think we're still of the same mind in terms of the aggregate exposure, which -- Mark, jump in here and make sure I say the right numbers. Yes. So nothing's really changed there, Nick. As what we have seen in the U.S. that to actually migrate customers and truly decommission sites, it's a little more complex. It takes a little more time than people think. Now that's really a timing comment. We don't -- we think the ultimate numbers will be what Brendan just said. But we really don't have any specific instructions from them as of this point. We do expect that, as the year progresses, we will begin to get more clarity on the timing and final amount that we will be looking at.  But they are -- on the other side, the 3 now nationwide carriers are all active to varying degrees with the new spectrum deployments. Yeah. I think, as our experimentation and learning process continues to move in a positive direction, it would not be impossible to see us buy a couple more datacenters, but I don't think we would ever get to the point where you would see -- I mean it won't ever get close to 1% of enterprise value, I don't believe. Well, I know, Brendan, you could get to the net, but I know that the gross number, Mike, we expect to grow sequentially as we move through the year. Well, clearly, there would be a rate level which would -- and I -- and I don't really want to get pinned down on what that is. But clearly, there would be a rate at which we would look at different leverage levels.  But beyond that, Mike, what we're looking at is our dividend, our dividend payout ratio, how much our EBITDA growth looks to be. So I mean we really do try and be very thoughtful and take into account everything that should be taken into account.  But I mean on an absolute basis, of course, there would be some interest rate that if we thought it was going to be maintained and sustained for long periods of time, if it were materially higher than where we are today, will cause us to revisit our leverage targets. Well, I think it's 100% for every customer that we have an MLA with is somehow touched by the MLA. So that's DISH, Verizon and T-Mobile. And then we don't have one with AT&T. It's not really a situation where some of it's covered and some of it's not per carrier. And just to be clear, our MLAs, though, are still based on specific activity from those customers and equipment specificity. They're not just a broad open-ended thing. We do. Although I know that they're working on an integrated one as well, which will come out at some point. Well, it will be primarily driven by what the equipment looks like and how it stacks up compared to: a, if anything is coming off, that's a swap. If it's not, then we would look at the equipment and price it accordingly based on height, weight, wind load. Yeah, they're not increasing. So that's -- we're thankful for that. There are some signs that the current interest rate environment is going to have a depressive effect on prices. As you know, Greg, it takes a while for current market conditions to factor through to private market sellers. However, it is headed in that direction where, obviously, rates should and I think will impact price over time.  On the supply side of equipment and labor, I don't want to jinx things, but as of today, we are not seeing any material impact on either the supply chain side or the labor side for our business. Yeah. I think I'd characterize the state of the escalator issue with our customers, Brett, as one where I think certainty and a fixed number benefits both sides. Even though, clearly, in a year like this, with a fixed escalator, one party wins, the other loses, but that's a very temporary kind of condition. And over time, the Fed has a mandate to reduce inflation back to 2% or less.  So I really don't know that there's a lot of appetite on either side to change that around really because if you have a very, very big inflation year, the person on the CPI end of that, whether it's us on ground leases or our customers on the tenant leases, they're not going to be happy. So I think we're pretty satisfied with the state of the world as it currently exists. And I don't think -- we consciously are making international decisions relative to U.S. decisions with any kind of belief that this will be better because we get CPI escalators. The traditional economic theory is if there's higher inflation in those markets, the currency is going to trade off.  So we don't really think that, that is a reason why to favor international over the U.S. The reason we go internationally is because we have a capital allocation and a target leverage, which we think is one of our principal creators of shareholder value, and we have been able to find enough to do in the U.S. And we found some very, very good things to do internationally, and I think that will continue to be the primary motivation. No, no. We've generally matched off -- when I say generally, I mean we've -- substantially, every single U.S. tower that is ground leased has a fixed escalator. And they typically average less than our average tenant escalator. So we feel -- and of course, you know that's our single largest source of expense and getting to the tower cash flow line is the ground leases. So we feel pretty well protected there, Brett. I think there's a different reason. I think, Walt, what you're looking at is kind of the gross churn that historically includes -- has always included some kind of consolidation churn. Apples to apples, you have to include the Sprint. And it's quite possible that you see it increase each succeeding quarter. I could tell you that the activity level is pretty broadly distributed. And we do have a construct with DISH where once the lease is signed, revenue recognition for us begins at either a construction milestone or a date certain. And it's really the -- to actually look at all that and synthesize that and turn it into guidance is a bit of an art. So there'll be some possibilities that things move around there.  But for the most part, as we move through the year, things are known with a greater degree of certainty. So there's some opportunities for some movement. But for the most part, we feel pretty, pretty good about DISH's contribution. In terms of your comment about them being behind by six-- I mean maybe that's their own internal goals and projections, but I would repeat what we've said now for, I think, the better part of the year, which is they're very active, actually busier with us than we thought they would be for a rolling 12-month period. And they continue to be very, very busy and driving hard towards satisfying their June 2023 regulatory obligations. Well, we like it low because it gives us plenty of opportunities, including stock repurchases, which we think -- I think the execution and the allocation that we have, including setting the dividend really has served our shareholders well.

So really, it's kind of the balance of those two which will ultimately drive where we set the dividend going forward, but I think you would agree at 25 -- less than a 25% payout ratio, we have a lot of room to increase the dividend materially in the years ahead.

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA started the year off with a very strong quarter with many of the results ahead of our internal expectations, and we continue to anticipate a solid performance throughout 2022.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $559.4 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $551.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were slightly ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, positively impacting revenues by approximately $2.3 million. They were also a tailwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $2.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.3% over the first quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.4%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 3.7% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was very strong again and materially higher than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at quarter end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the rest of 2022.  During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 55% of our domestic bookings, with 45% coming from new leases. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7% net, including 4.8% of churn or 11.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again. And we continue to see increasing customer activity levels in many of our markets. International growth continued to climb higher, in part due to increased inflation of -- I'm sorry, in part due to increased inflation-based escalators.  In Brazil, our largest international market, we also had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.3% on a constant currency basis. During the first quarter, 82.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.  Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $445.3 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 68% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were modestly impacted by our new, less mature Tanzania assets. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $423.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.2%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.  During the first quarter, our services business produced record results for the fourth quarter in a row with $60.3 million in revenue and $14.6 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlog, finishing the quarter at the highest level in our company's history. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for increased contributions from our services business throughout the balance of 2022. AFFO in the first quarter was $324.3 million. AFFO per share was $2.96, an increase of 14.7% over the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 1,807 communication sites for total cash consideration of $215.4 million, which includes 1,445 sites for $176.1 million closed on January 4 and our previously disclosed acquisition from Airtel Tanzania.  We also built 86 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 358 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $127.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of a stand-alone datacenter in Sao Paulo, Brazil for cash consideration of approximately $49 million. The datacenter currently produces approximately $8.3 million in annual revenue and $3.5 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This acquisition was done in support of our continuing evaluation and efforts around the potential expansion of mobile edge computing to our tower sites. In addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $8.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Looking ahead now. This afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook for most of our key metrics from the outlook we previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. These increases are partially due to revised expectations for better foreign currency exchange rates than previously assumed. These FX changes have contributed an increase to our revenue outlook of approximately $21 million and our adjusted EBITDA outlook of approximately $13 million.  In addition, we have increased the midpoint of our outlook for site leasing revenue by $17 million on a constant currency basis. This increase is due to several factors, including lower domestic churn impact during 2022 as a result of longer decommissioning cycles as compared to SBA's initial estimates, higher international CPI-based escalators, higher reimbursable and miscellaneous onetime revenue items and contributions from acquisitions completed during and after the quarter, all of which was partially offset by increased churn in Panama. On April 6, Digicel Panama, one of our primary customers in Panama, announced that they intend to apply for voluntary liquidation and withdraw from the telecommunications market in Panama. While there are likely many developments and steps to take place over the coming months, we have increased our projected 2022 churn impact by approximately $6 million to account for the loss of all leasing revenue from Digicel Panama for the balance of the year.  Notwithstanding this one churn issue, as noted, there were a number of very positive developments in our business over the last two months that have resulted in a significant increase in our full year revenue outlook. In addition to the leasing benefits I just mentioned, we also raised the midpoint of our services revenue outlook by $27 million or over 13% due to our very strong first quarter results and the continuing strength of our backlogs. The strength of both our leasing and services business has allowed us to raise the midpoint of our full year outlook for AFFO per share by $0.24.  Our full year 2022 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to continue to optimize our balance sheet. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet. Just, Amir, on the churn question, we don't have any real changes to our long-term expectations. What you're seeing is a slight shift in timing. So a little bit less of an expectation in this year, but ultimately, those incremental dollars would just move to next year. So what we've given out in the past in terms of expectations each year is generally the same as it's been before. And it is in guidance, too, the datacenter. Yeah. So the $6 million of incremental churn for Digital represents about three quarters. So there'll be another couple of million dollars into next year. There's probably also a little bit of additional, Rick, because we were already assuming some digital churn previously, not associated with this liquidation, just as they were shutting down certain sites because they were obviously already having some issues. So there's probably an extra $1 million or so in addition that would flow into next year. The CPI in Brazil right now for us -- for our average for the year went to about 9%. The actual rate is higher than that. It's closer to 11%, I believe, right now. And the timing is really tied to when the leases individually escalate. There are some larger concentrations because of some of the acquisitions that we did. Those tend to be in the fourth quarter and the second quarter. But really, it's just a function of the time that the anniversary date of each individual lease and what the CPI looks like on a year-over-year basis at that point in time. Yeah. On the rate impacts, the impact is primarily due to: one, an assumed increase in CPI rates; and two, slightly more of our revolver being drawn during the course of the year associated with some of the incremental spend that we've just incurred or have under contract. So if you look at our CapEx guidance, it's up a little bit so that, that requires that along with the share repurchases that we did that weren't assumed before that we have a little bit more capital drawn and because it's floating rate and the CPI is increasing. That's really driving the increase in our net cash interest expense guidance that we gave. Otherwise, there's really no changes to that. Yeah. What's in the guidance for 2022 is now approximately $27 million. I think we had previously told you $30 million. Obviously, we lowered our full year number by $3 million. The first quarter piece of that, I don't know -- let me check that and get back to you, and I'll mention on the call if we are done with you before then. Yeah. We do expect the growth to move up sequentially. We also expect the churn node to move up sequentially during the year. Obviously, as indicated by the first quarter shift here, there's some potential that our expectations around timing are off on the churn, but our expectation and what's in our guidance shows that it's increasing. So the net will be a modest increase, maybe flat to modest increase quarter-over-quarter going through the year. In terms of the mix, I don't think we want to get into the individual carriers that make up the mix. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that on a lot of -- the last few quarters, a lot of the lease-up, one of the significant contributors there was DISH in terms of their new agreements. So obviously, they would be a nice component of that growth, but all the carriers have contributed to the lease-up activity. So they're all in the mix. And Mike, before you go, let me follow back up on your question about how much Sprint in the first quarter. It was approximately $4 million of impact in the quarter, so a little over 1% of the roughly 2.7%. Greg, I think we missed your first question. You didn't -- you were -- the first part of that cut off. No, I don't -- I mean I think it's -- so that what's left is about 1.5, maybe 1.6% if you exclude the Sprint piece. And I don't think that's lower. I mean we've actually been -- we've been much lower than that. If you go back a couple of years ago where we were below 1%, but we've historically been somewhere in that usually between 1% and 2%, sometimes lower. So I don't think it's abnormal. Yeah. Maybe that's -- obviously, we've had Metro Leap and Clearwire. We had iDEN-related churns. We're expecting a larger step up as we move throughout the year. So I mean, just incrementally, I think stepping up because it just builds over time. But it's really dependent on when those leases turn down, termination dates and everything else. Yeah. No, it's going to step up, but I think mostly in the second half of the year. There'll be a modest step-up is our expectation next quarter and then more material into the third and then even further into the fourth quarter. No. We don't adjust our underwriting. We may do fewer deals, David. But if you look at the history of what we've done, we like what we've done, and we'll continue to exercise the same discipline.  And I think when you -- if you really understand what we're about, it's about creating value for our shareholders. There aren't particularly great as we see them strategic benefits of just being big in a bunch of different countries. We are much more interested in the financial characteristics and investment goals of each and every transaction. And we lose a lot, but we get enough to generally satisfy our 5% to 10% portfolio growth goals. And we're going to continue to operate that way. We typically will use whatever the forwards are that you would generally pull from Bloomberg, some sort of average of a number of institutions that published projections. The one thing I can assure you of, David, is that we will be wrong on what we assume. I don't know whether we'll be wrong to the positive or the negative, but it's very hard to nail down. So we use what the experts are saying at any given time. But even since we kind of put our numbers together, which is at the end of last week, just in the last 2 days, we've seen the currency weakened relative to the dollar. So it's a little bit closer. So you -- basically, if you look at Brazil, our average for the balance of the year that we've assumed is essentially 5:1. And I think today, it ended up 4 88 or something like that. So it's fairly close to what the spot rate is. Okay. On the backlog question, just to be clear on how we evaluate backlog for our leasing business, we're looking at the number of applications for new leases and amendments. Obviously, the pricing may vary depending on exactly what they do and sometimes that pricing has to be negotiated.  So it's not necessarily dollar-based. So I think I can't -- the number of applications is up. So when we say it's up, that's what we're referring to. So I can't really give you a -- what would the lease-up be if it were the same for the last few quarters. On the leasing dollars question in the fourth quarter, we do think we can get to the low-20s by the end of the year. As to whether that would be a run rate going forward is partially dependent on activity levels for the balance of this year, which we think will remain fairly strong. But as of today, I can't comment on what next year's number will be. M&A under contract mix. It's largely international. There is some domestic and some international. Was there more to the question?"

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good morning, everyone -- I'm sorry -- good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 26, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Marc to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2024 outlook.\nMarc Montagner: Thank you, Mark. We ended 2023 with another strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allow us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Consolidated same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% net year-over-year including impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Of that 3.4%, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation churn. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was consistent with the lower levels of activity we saw during the second and third quarter of 2023. Full year organic leasing contribution to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our previously provided outlook. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn was also in line with our prior expectations and continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. International same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.2% net, including 5.9% of churn or 10.1% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 8% on a constant currency basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to [carrier] (ph) consolidation. During the fourth quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our tower portfolio, acquiring 23 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $21.3 million. We also built 138 new sites. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have purchased under agreement to acquire 281 sites in all of our existing markets for an aggregate price of $87.8 million. We anticipate closing on this site under contract by the end of the third quarter. Looking ahead, this afternoon, earnings press release includes our initial outlook for the full year 2024. Our outlook reflects a continuation of the reduced level of carrier CapEx that began early last year. Despite this, our leasing business will continue to grow organically through contribution from new leases amendment and contracted escalators. Domestically, our outlook assumes $55 million of customer churn in 2024, of which approximately $30 million related to Sprint related decommissioning. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remain largely unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in 2026 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. Internationally, our outlook includes approximately $22 million churn in 2024. During the fourth quarter of '23, we signed a multiyear agreement with Vivo in Brazil. Under this agreement, we expect to incur $4 million wireless consolidation churn in 2024 and an additional $2 million over the next several years. Total anticipated wireless consolidated churn remains at approximately $30 million. Additionally, our full year 2024 outlook reflects a year-over-year decline in service revenue and gross profit due to the lower overall carrier activity in the US. However, our outlook is in line with the historical performance, excluding our very strong result in 2022 and '23 due to the initial rollout of 5G network by some of our wireless customers during these years. This outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract and does not assume any share repurchase. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets and/or share repurchase during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and core FFO and FFO per share include the recent refinancing of our term loan B debt, the upsize of our credit facility and the future [refinancing up with rerating rate] (ph) in the future of our $620 million ABS tower securities maturing in October 2024. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we have ample liquidity. In January of 2024, we refinanced our $2.3 billion credit facility, pushing out the maturity to 2031. We also increased our revolver capacity by $500 million. Our $2 billion revolver is almost fully paid down. Our leverage remains at historical lows and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5 turns, giving us plenty of dry powder for opportunistic acquisition and/or share repurchase. Lastly, we purchased a forward-starting interest rate swap in the fourth quarter. This will give us great certainty around great uncertainty on future interest costs. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional detail.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.3 times, which is below the low end of our target range and near the lowest level we have seen in decades. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2 times. During the fourth quarter 2023, the company entered into a $1 billion forward starting interest rate swap, which will swap one-month SOFR for a fixed rate of 3.83%. The swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, which coincides with the expiration of our existing $1.95 billion notional interest rate swap. This forward starting interest rate swap agreement will expire April 11, 2028. Subsequent to the fourth quarter and on January 25th of 2024, the company issued a new $2.3 billion secured term loan B under its amended and restated senior credit agreement. This matures in January of 2031. The new term loan accrues interest at SOFR plus 200 basis points. The existing $1.95 billion interest rate swap will remain in effect until expiration on March 31, 2025. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds were used to retire the company's 2018 term loan and to pay related fees and expenses. Also subsequent to the quarter, on February 23, 2024, the company further increased the total commitments under the revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2 billion. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $70 million outstanding balance under our $2 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.1 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.4%. The interest rate on 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the fourth quarter, as we previously discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we repurchased 235 -- I'm sorry, 234,000 shares of our common stock, $46 million at an average price of $198.27 per share. We currently have $405 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2023, were 108.1 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $91.8 million or $0.85 a share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend we paid in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. I am pleased for the opportunity to reflect on our 2023 performance and to share our thoughts about 2024 and beyond. 2023 was a year marked by some significant macro headwinds, in particular, the consistently high interest rate environment that not only directly affected SBA's floating rate debt costs and the views around our cost of future refinancing, but also impacted our customers and their network spending levels. In spite of these macro headwinds, SBA executed extremely well and produced solid financial results. When compared against the initial outlook for 2023, given in February of last year, our actual results for the year finished materially above the high end of the ranges given for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Most of the outperformance was organic as we spent very little incremental discretionary CapEx in comparison to our initial outlook. Our excess free cash flow was instead largely spent on paying down our floating rate revolver debt, and we finished the year at a multi-decade low leverage level of 6.3 times and today have a current revolver balance of only $70 million. Internally, it was a year of leadership transition for the company. Jeff Stoops retirement, the addition of Marc Montagner to the team and new leaders in our international, legal and IT functions. Everyone has stepped up extremely well into their roles, and I am very happy with how the team is collaborating and performing. The disciplined succession planning and highly capable team members assembled throughout the organization have positioned us well for the future. As we look forward to 2024, we recognize that we are coming off of a period of reduced network investment by our largest domestic customers. However, future network needs for each of these customers remain significant, and we anticipate being a critical partner for our customers in meeting their operational goals and objectives. A significant percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades, which we are confident will take place over the next couple of years. In addition, the success and growth of fixed wireless access as a product offering for our customers will add greater demand for increased network capacity as the average user of this product uses 20 times or more broadband data than the typical mobile customer. And the evolution of AI-infused 5G offerings will continue to fuel the demand for improved speeds and lower latency. All of these factors as well as good old-fashioned service-based competition are supportive of steady organic leasing activity on our US assets for years to come. Internationally, we also see a dynamic of significant network needs, providing a backdrop for continued solid organic leasing activity throughout many of our markets. Financial pressures have impacted many of our international customers as well but the demand for advanced wireless products and services is significant, and in a number of cases, even greater than that seen in the US. We expect this will in turn drive continued demand for incremental space at our tower sites. Nonetheless, there have been customer consolidations in several of our markets. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary efficiencies in their operations, but while preserving the breadth of our business relationships, and solidifying our contractual commitments for the long term. While this temporarily leads to elevated churn, we believe the long-term strength and stability of our cash flow streams produced as a result of these efforts meaningfully improves our go-forward value proposition. This is a good segue into my views around our forward strategy. Internally, we are highlighting a desire to analyze everything we do or consider doing through the lens of stabilizing our results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. While this is not materially different than the approach SBA has taken throughout its history, we recognize that not all of our assets or business lines fit well within this goal. As a result, we are doing the work to evaluate our full portfolio and develop action plans around how we improve our position in each business line and in each market. For instance, in our international operations, we have found it to be valuable to be a market leader in the markets we operate in. In places where we hold a more significant position, we have tended to do better than those places where we do not. This ultimately means that we need to find a path to increase scale in certain markets or possibly exit a market. An example of this was our fourth quarter exit from Argentina. Not only was our market position subscale, but the economic instability in that country created operational challenges that were dilutive to the otherwise typically very attractive attributes of the tower business. We will pursue incremental investments to drive continued growth as we always have. But we will prioritize either an overall favorable shift in the quality and stability of our asset mix or an opportunistic investment that improves our standing and existing markets. Financial results always matter. We will be disciplined toward producing the best possible financial results over the long term. We believe high-quality assets ultimately produce that result. We also believe that when opportunities for incremental asset investments are not available, stock repurchases and debt reductions are worthwhile uses of capital. We intend to continually evaluate our optimal capital structure, and we'll look to balance the lowest cost of capital with retaining appropriate investment flexibility. Our attention to optimize capitalization of the company has placed us in what I believe is the best position in the industry. We are the fastest dividend grower, but yet have the greatest retained AFFO post dividend to invest in the business. We have maintained an average cost of debt very close to our larger peers, but have retained access to up to two turns more leverage. We have recently extended and expanded our revolver capacity by $500 million, creating increased liquidity. This structure provides us with significant optionality to move in whichever direction we believe will provide the best return for our shareholders. The strength and stability of our core tower business remains and it provides a tremendous foundation for all future endeavors. As a result, I have great confidence in our ability to create future value for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers for their support and their confidence in SBA. I also want to thank our team members for their contributions to our success. And with that, Eric, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First, we will hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone and Brendan, congrats on the new seat. Mark with the K, welcome to the calls.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you.\nRic Prentiss: First, leverage obviously has been a key focus. You guys have been paying down floating rate debt. You've got your net leverage down to 6.3 turns. Almost all the floating is paid off as of today then. How should we think about 6.3, where it heads in the future versus stock buyback? And then on the M&A side, update us as far as what you're seeing out there, you mentioned that you like to be the leader in your markets. Are there any deals out there that would give you an industry-leading position? And what would kind of make that an interesting market if there were new markets out there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So Rick, on the leverage side, we're at 6.3 times mostly because we believe that throughout the last year, the best use of our capital was into paying down that floating rate debt that we had with some of the highest cost debt in our structure. And we didn't necessarily see opportunities that we thought were a better use of capital. but we're comfortable at a higher level of leverage if we see the right place to use that capital. That may include some amount of stock buybacks, but it also obviously would include quality acquisitions if we see that opportunity. So really, what we're doing is, we're retaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet to go in whichever direction we think produces the best result. We don't feel that we have to stay at this level, but if we do, that's fine too. On the M&A front, yeah, it's one of the aspects of what we look for when we're looking at a new market or even at opportunities within some of our existing markets where we're perhaps not a market leader in terms of our position is to be a leader, if we can in terms of our size and importance to our customers. We used to just assume that we look at all opportunities that are available throughout the globe, frankly, as they come available, and we consider that among a number of other factors where we're looking at that. I can't really speak to anything specific that we're looking at, but there definitely are opportunities out there.\nRic Prentiss: Obviously, we're sitting here at the end of February. Can you help us understand the pacing of what you think new lease activity in the United States will kind of play out through the year? And is it still kind of three months, maybe closer to six months as far as when you get an application in to where it actually turns into revenue?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. The time frame from signing something to when it actually gets into revenue is still pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. Obviously, it's a little bit longer for a brand-new lease when we sign that. That's usually a good six months or more on the amendments, it's typically shorter, closer to three months, but it depends on the specific circumstances. So that's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. In terms of the pacing throughout the year, our projections, if you look at our bridge in terms of what we've put forth as contributions, and I assume you're asking about domestic specifically. But domestically, that number should be a little bit more front-end loaded today because it's based on activity that we've seen throughout last year and that's kind of rolling over. And at this point, we're not necessarily forecasting a material pickup in activity. But to the extent there is that pickup in activity, it's mostly going to impact next year.\nRic Prentiss: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And next we will hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. Two questions. One, you talked about the willingness to examine an exit from markets where you lack scale, does that apply to product areas such as data centers? And then my second question is, you called out the Vivo relationship in Brazil. Anything with TIM or Claro along similar lines where you might be renegotiating some of your commercial terms or looking to kind of react to market conditions in Brazil? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On your first question, there's no specific plans to exit anything -- to exit the data centers or anything else in particular. But I will tell you that we are applying the same lens to everything that we do as we kind of evaluate these various things, whether it's international markets or its other product lines. And we look at that through a financial lens and what the future can be, opportunities to grow it, what are the synergies with our base core business. I mean, ultimately, we're a tower company, how do things fit in with that. As we go through that analysis, we may come to the conclusion with something that we should exit it, but we may also come to the conclusion that we should grow it too. So at this stage, it's premature to say that we would make a decision one way or the other, but you should assume that we're looking at each of our holdings through that lens. With regard to Brazil, we did actually -- I don't know if you recall, Jon, but last year, we announced about a year ago at this time that we had entered into an agreement with TIM related to the Oi consolidation and it actually pulled forward some of the churn into 2023 associated with that consolidation, but it dealt with a number of other issues and extended agreements out. So we already have something largely in place with Tim. In the case of Claro, there's currently nothing in place, but we're constantly in discussions with them and it may or may not lead to something, but we're talking with them about what would be best for them and for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll hear form Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congratulations both Brendan and Mark on your newish positions. Brendan, I guess to start, you noted that you tend to do better in markets where you have meaningful scale or a leadership position. How do you define a leadership position? Is that share of total assets owned both on threshold? Or is it some other measure? And does this general framework that you're embracing mean it's less likely that you're going to enter into a new market? Or is that sort of a separate consideration if you think you're on a path to a leadership position in it?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. It basically means your relevance in the market to your customers, which generally means the size and scale of your operations. So the percentage of the portfolio that you represent for the larger, most important customers in that market. When you are at a level that is frankly immaterial to their network needs, your ability to drive additional business and to negotiate terms on new opportunities is just not as great as when you're a more meaningful partner. So that's really what I mean when I talk about the size and scale. As it relates to new markets, that would be a consideration, obviously, before we go into the new market, what's our position going to look like in that market. So it doesn't mean that we would not go into a new market, but we would consider that factor as one of the factors when we're thinking about it.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And then regarding domestic leasing in '24 in the US, your guidance of $42 million this year, and you just said it was going to be probably front-end loaded. I think you've previously spoken to sort of the low end of a range of leasing over time as being around $40 million. It seems like the run rate in the second half of the year, if $42 million is front-end loaded, it might annualize to a pace below $40 million. I guess do you see a plausible scenario where full year leasing could go below $40 million in light of current conditions?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, yeah, it could. Obviously, we're just above $40 million now for this year. So if we don't see any pickup as we get to the second half of the year, I do expect that the run rate at the end of the year today, that's implied in our guidance would be slightly below $40 million. So it\u2019s possible. I think though some of this is lumpiness in the way that things come in under our AT&T MLA agreement. So the fact that it's a little higher in the first part of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year could be something we see next year as well.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Thanks for that, Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So I guess the first one, for the guidance, it was clear that you weren't assuming any new portfolio acquisitions or buybacks, but could you be specific about what you are assuming in the guide for the use of cash? Is it putting it in the bank at a 5% interest rate? Or what should we kind of use as a baseline as a comparison to what's going on? I guess a second question, if I could, is -- Brendan, is there a fuse on any of these decisions about whether to pull the trigger on portfolio acquisition versus stock buybacks, given that your stock buybacks could be pretty powerful if they happen sooner rather than later? And I apologize, if I could just one last one for Mark D. This $1 billion hedge on a forward basis that you've put in place, which replaces the existing hedge on the $2 billion term that comes due March '25, I'm assuming that there's an opportunity if you chose to do something additional to the $3.85 million that you've locked in, is there a timetable to make that decision? Thank you.\nMark DeRussy: There is the possibility to do that. We have done this in the past. This hedge only represents 50% of what our actual outstanding debt is. So there could be room to increase our or hedging along those lines as well. But with respect to any type of timetable, David, no, there is no timetable. We're just going to keep an eye on the market and act appropriately if we decide that that's the thing that we need to do.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. On that item, David, I mean, really the thinking was that we sort of took half of it and created some level of certainty given that there's some instability, obviously, in what interest rates will look like. And we've seen -- we've all seen over the last few months, expectations of when interest rate cuts are going to happen, move around quite a bit. So for us, we basically ensure that a portion of that debt, we would have some stability and certainty on it. And it locks in basically at much lower rate than exists today. So if we let the other piece flow, I think we can have a good natural hedge in that case. On your other questions on the use of cash in our guidance, we do -- because there will be cash that's obviously accumulated, part of it first goes into paying down the revolver, of course, what's left outstanding on that and it covers some of the discretionary spending that is implied in our guidance for deals that are under contract as well as new builds, the items that are basically covered in our discretionary CapEx guidance. Anything excess is assumed to be invested at about a 4% or so interest rate. So that is implied in our net cash interest guidance, some interest income on that. And then I think your other question was the M&A versus buybacks and the timing. I mean, we -- there's a variety of things that we're constantly looking at. And the timing of M&A transactions, you don't have as much control over. Obviously, we have complete control over buybacks. And so -- to some degree, we have to balance the capital that we have available and that we may or may not need. And so sometimes we can jump in earlier. If we have a clear vision as to what's going to happen and other times, we have to hold back a little bit and see how things play out. So I hear what you're saying, and we obviously believe our stock is a good buy at this level that we've got to balance that against all the different options in front of us.\nDavid Barden: Got it, very helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First, as you look at the business going forward, can you give us an update as to what are your North Star metrics that are guiding the decision-making and your measurement of performance? Is it organic leasing, EBITDA, AFFO per share or other metrics that are important to you and the Board? And can you give us some direction of how you see that growth in those metrics, let's say, over the next three years? And then just separately, just more of an operational question on the tower portfolio. Can you give us an update as to what percent of the sites have been upgraded and touched to bring them to 5G mid-band capabilities? And over what period do you think you get to 100%? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So, Mike, the numbers that we typically report on, we report on because we think they're the most important. I think the number one metric in our view here and with our Board and frankly, with many of our investors is AFFO per share because it represents that amount of actual free cash flow that is available to be returned to shareholders in some form or fashion, whether that be reinvested into the business, or be paid out as a dividend or be used for stock buybacks, whatever the usage is, it's effectively what's available at the end of the day after everything has been paid for. And so that's the metric that we focus on most of all. Having said that, obviously, the next few years, there are some challenges to our AFFO per share metric, largely because of two things that are not new. Interest rates, we've done an excellent job over the last many years locking in very low-cost debt, but the market is what it is. And at some point, you have to refinance at least some of that debt. And so you're going to see higher interest costs that weighs on that a little bit. And of course, the Sprint churn, in particular, that is kind of out there that we know we have ahead of us, and we've scoped for you as to what that looks like. But outside of that, the real goal, frankly, is to see that number go up over an extended period of time. This is a business that is a very long-term business at its core. We have very long-term contracts. Our relationships are long term. The assets are long term. And so we look at how we're going to maximize that number over an extended period of time. As a public company, it can be challenging because you're reporting every single quarter, and so it gets scrutinized every quarter, but the nature of the business is long term. So we try to take that long-term view on how we're going to grow that number out over a period of five to 10 years. And I think we'll be well positioned to do that. The other metrics though are very important as well. Obviously, growing site leasing revenue, growing adjusted EBITDA shows that we're able to find continued returns on our operations, but really AFFO per share is where I focus most of my energy. And then I guess your second question was about the upgrade percentage for 5G. We're a little bit over halfway in terms of upgrades to our sites for 5G, but that is different among the different carriers. Some are much further along and others are below that number. So we still have a pretty good runway. I think we're looking at the next two to three years to get to where they've upgraded all the sites they need to.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Right. Thank you very much and congrats on your new role, Brendan and Mark, great to reconnect and good luck in your new role. Two, if I could. First, on the M&A. I think in the past, you've noted that the M&A multiples haven't necessarily come in to reflect the new interest rate environment. It would be great to just get some perspective of -- if you see a better risk-reward balance there for the growth and the multiples that you're paying. Obviously, you've done some transactions versus buying back your own stock? And secondly, anything you could share with us on DISH and how you think about DISH within your leasing assumptions, especially given they have some specific FCC and DOJ targets to hit in mid-'25? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, the M&A market is still quite competitive. In the US, in particular, because there's such a limited number of assets available, they're very competitively bid. So we continue to see price points that are very high. Internationally, that is also true, although I would say we've seen a little more moderation with the increasing cost of capital in terms of international price points. But the interesting thing about that is what it's resulted in is not necessarily deals being done at lower prices in many cases, but frankly, deals not getting done at all where there's sort of a disconnect between where seller expectations are and where buyers are willing to pay. I think you'll start to see some of that shift over the course of the coming year, particularly if the interest rate environment remains elevated. In the case of DISH, yeah, they are certainly a component of our assumptions for our leasing growth for this year. They have -- they do have the deadlines that you mentioned, and we've had ongoing conversations with them, and we believe that they will be attacking those obligations aggressively. So we do have some amount of growth in our model associated with DISH. But I would say it's a relatively small percentage of the total.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just a two-parter. First, on the strategic review, Brendan, is this at all a pullback from I guess, more emerging markets and a pivot of the portfolio towards more developed markets? Is there anything of that sort underpinning the review? And then maybe on a related note, any additional color you could provide on the 281 sites that were acquired subsequent to 4Q just in terms of region or any other color you can share? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. I'll take the second one first. The 281 aren't necessarily all closed at this point. They're either -- I think a few are closed, but most are just under contract at this point. And about 10% of those are in the US. The remaining 90% are located throughout our existing markets in half a dozen different countries that we're already in. In the case of the way we're thinking about the strategic review, it's really -- it's not necessarily emerging markets versus developed although that can be a factor. It's a focus on how we maximize our position in those markets. So we have positions in emerging markets that are very strong because of the strength of our role and our existing relationships with the strongest carriers in those markets. And so if we can enhance that in places where we don't have it, then I think we would be comfortable with the markets regardless of whether they were necessarily developed or emerging markets. However, I think developed markets do offer some aspects of quality that we would find attractive if we can find the right opportunities, things like strong tower siding, regulatory regimes, certainly strength of the wireless carriers in the market and a relative balance to their market share, stability of the currency, stability of the tax regime, things like that would be things that we would find valuable. Because at the end of the day, sort of the value proposition of a tower company when most people look at it is this expectation that you have a long-term, very stable cash flow stream that is going to grow both steadily over time. And sometimes if you're in places that don't have some of those attributes I just mentioned, you can introduce a certain amount of volatility that we would be looking to obviously try to move out of the mix and focus more on that kind of stable growing cash flow stream. So I think we're open to shift in the type of market, but I think the markets that we're in have opportunities to improve our positioning and that's what we're looking at.\nMatt Niknam: Is there a time frame attached to the strategic review?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It's something that I would expect us to be working on throughout this year, but there are also factors that are outside of our control, things that we would like to do. That may take some time to figure out whether the opportunity is actually exist. So I think it will be an ongoing effort. But the real point -- and this isn't some wholesale change just to kind of reiterate that. It's not like we were doing something totally one way before, we completely shifted. This is more of a refinement of the approach that SBA has historically taken. We've always -- I think you know us to have always focused on quality, financial returns. All those things are still the same. What this really is, is kind of digging in a little bit deeper on some of our current holdings and looking at where we're underperforming, what are the root causes of that and what can we do to address that? And if we can't -- if we don't feel we can address it, then we would look at it like Argentina and say, \"Hey, this we don't think we necessarily can fix so we'll adjust\". So again, it's really just a refinement of what has been our long-standing policy.\nMatt Niknam: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi, I just wanted to ask about the pacing of the services revenue through the year. And then another question on -- in terms of new activity. How much of it is coming from colocation versus amendments? And do you expect any significant change through the year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. The services revenue, we actually, in our outlook, expect it to slightly increase, but to be relatively balanced throughout the year. On the colos versus amendments, if you're -- I don't know if you're asking about the actuals of the fourth quarter, where it was more -- we've seen more of a shift towards new leases, but I would expect as we get into this year, you'll see amendment activity again be the lion's share of what we do.\nRichard Choe: Got it. And a final one is in terms of Argentina, can you quantify what the impact would have been to revenue and EBITDA had you kept it?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. It was -- it represented about $1 million of EBITDA and a little over $2 million, about $2.3 million of revenue on an annual basis.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Elias with TD Cowen.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First time caller, long time listener here. My first question for you is, you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks about the stability of results. I'm curious if on the US side that we should take that to mean you're more open to doing what's holistic MLAs with the carriers that you have with AT&T. That's my first question. And then the second question is when you talked about the use of cash, you were essentially mentioning that you assume the remainder is reinvested at around 4%. So when I take a look at the AFFO yield of your stock, it's implying over 6%. You talked about earlier how you may hold back if you see some opportunities. I guess what I'm getting at here is, are you holding back on the buyback under the expectation that you're going to go forward and do more M&A? Just trying to get some more color in terms of what you're thinking on the buybacks versus the M&A. Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: So on holistic MLAs, I think that is a -- when we talk about a goal of trying to ensure that we have stabilized our cash flow streams and results, one of the ways you do that is through enhancing and improving customer relationships. And that can be done in part through master agreements. We obviously signed one with AT&T last year. We've signed others in the past with each of our customers along the way. So I would expect we will continue to make use of that, assuming that it's the best structure for what our customers need to get done and SBA is able to achieve a certain amount of certainty and length of commitment as part of those agreements. But each of those will be determined on an individual basis based on the needs of the customer and what we need. Again, the buybacks versus M&A, yeah, I mean, we are -- we're not necessarily sitting here saying we've got all this cash we're ready to spend on buybacks. We are -- in fact, we still have balances out on our revolver. So I don't feel like we've necessarily been in that position. We have historically been very opportunistic around share buybacks. I would expect that to continue to be the case now. But individual acquisition opportunities, particularly of size, may influence our timing on when we would buy back our stock if we otherwise saw it as an attractive investment. So that's where we are, and we'll see as time goes by. But just because you don't see us buy back our stock doesn't necessarily mean that we don't see it as a good value. It means there may be other factors we're considering.\nMichael Elias: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just -- it's been asked a few ways but maybe to put it in a different term. Can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in the $42 million of domestic leasing guidance that relates to kind of the lap-over effective signings in 2023 versus what you need to sign in 2024 itself?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I can't tell you exactly with precision sitting here, but I'm sure we can follow up with you. It is largely based on what's already been signed up to date. I'm sure it's somewhere in the three quarters range of the number, but maybe even more. So we'll follow up with you, Brendan, separately on that.\nBrendan Lynch: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then one other question on international churn. I know you were expecting some churn in some Latin American markets. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there. It did seem to tick up a bit in the fourth quarter and give some color on what you anticipate throughout the next year.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. So I mentioned it briefly in my prepared comments, but there are a number of markets that we're in where we have consolidations taking place, in particular, in Brazil where you had the Oi wireless consolidation with the other big three carriers there as we kind of work through that. Last year, that was a big factor. It represented roughly 40%. It was just from 10% by itself, associated with that consolidation, there's one item. That is probably going to be a continued driver of some level of international churn over the next few years. But we're working through negotiations with each of our customers. And as we do that, we're kind of pricing this long-term relationship, long-term commitment where we've got stability that we can reintroduce into the relationship, but allow them to get through the efficiencies that they need to achieve as a result of the combination of customers that's taking place in the market. So it's a mix, but Brazil will probably be the biggest just because it's the biggest market we have with the most revenue.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. I guess just a quick follow-on for that one. In your discussions with those customers, is there an opportunity with Mobile and maybe take ownership of those towers? Do you think there would be some regulatory issues with that?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I probably can't answer that in this forum, Walt. But we do have ongoing conversations with them about all different things that they do that we do that might fit together. So -- go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Just looking through history, you go back to Oi and then you look at PGE and you maxed the balance sheet at like $7.7 million. Is that coincidental? Or is that kind of your threshold of pain in terms of where you would take something for the opportunities that exist out there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, it's probably coincidental to some degree. I don't think you'd see us go above 8x at any point in our history. But now that we've got this -- we've got a pretty big cushion given where our leverage has come down to. So I don't really foresee that ever being a number that we approach.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. Well, that gives us a sense of the size of things that you can consider. And then just lastly, just kind of a touchy-feely question, which is these operators have a lot of spectrum, which makes it a little different than past capital cycles when there's kind of an ebb and flow. What gives you confidence that when this ebb turns to flow, it\u2019s not only going to be in markets where it can be satisfied with rooftops and small cells as opposed to traditional areas where densification is required? I'm talking domestically, forget about your global markets.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, what -- I mean, really what gives me confidence, but we'll see how it plays out, its history. I mean, every time we've seen the cycle of activity, it's ultimately gotten to the suburban markets, the rural markets. Those dense urban centers really were never tower markets to begin with. So it's not really been a factor for us. Anything that's getting resolved with root tops, that's a very limited tower market. So I'm not sure it matters that much to us.\nWalter Piecyk: So are there factors that in suburbia that you could hit or not you, but like, let's say, TMS, Verizon, maybe AT&T jumps on board. They hit enough penetration that the depth of spectrum that they have from C-band and the Sprint spectrum is not enough to serve whatever, let's call it, 30% penetration that they would require additional identification.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we will hear from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hey, thanks. Sticking with the US on the $40-ish million in new leasing activity expected in '24, is this level of the new run rate we should expect as we model out over the next few years? Or do you think there's a chance that new leasing levels might reach what we saw in '22 and '23, again? And then the second question was, could you just comment on the discretionary CapEx spend for '24? It looked like it stepped up pretty meaningfully from '23, what drove that increase?\nBrendan Cavanagh: So the leasing level into the future, yeah, we think it could go up, sure. Obviously, it's all driven by carrier activity. I mean if you go back over the last three years, David, you will see, if you go back a few years ago, that we were at a level very similar to where we are now. In fact, I think we reported a number lower than the $42 million that we just put in our outlook for this year, three, four years ago. So since that time, obviously, it spiked up much higher than that because of carrier activity. And I think to some degree, the network strain that they may feel the -- and the cost of capital is very impactful to the decisions they're making there. And so yes, we believe there's definitely opportunity to see the number go higher in future years, but we need to see how that moves. In the case of -- I'm sorry, your other question was on CapEx?\nDavid Guarino: Correct.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I think -- I don't believe -- I believe what we guided to was similar to what last year's number was. Yeah it\u2019s where we guided to, $330 million at the midpoint and last year, it was $310 million. So sorry, Dave, what do you -- what's the core of the question?\nDavid Guarino: No, my apologies, I must have misread that wrong. If it's flat, you can disregard the question.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Okay. All right. Thanks.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on -- AT&T recently signed a new contract with FirstNet. Can you provide color if that will be included within the current M&A you have with them or provide some upside? And just another one on M&A. As you think about increasing your portfolio, do you have a preference for carrier-owned towers versus portfolios that are coming out of independent tower operators? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. With regards to AT&T FirstNet, for the most part, I would expect, based on my understanding of everything that is expected to happen there, that it would have limited upside for us from an amendment or upgrade standpoint, the opportunity set would be more based on a need to densify where they needed to actually have new lease agreements at existing sites or possibly even new tower builds. So it's really a new site leasing opportunity to the extent that there is an impact, but I do not think there's much of an amendment impact potential for us. With regards to the M&A question, we would -- generally speaking, I would say we would prefer independent tower company towers as opposed to carrier owned towers, usually, we find that they've been developed with the mindset of co-location already in there, and they are operated and maintained in a way typically that is better than what you find with the traditional carrier sale leaseback. But having said that, we've done both kinds of deals, and I think our what we bring to the table is our expertise that allows us to kind of improve those operations. Sometimes there's greater opportunity for improvement when you buy things that haven't been run quite as well. So I guess it just depends on the individual opportunity.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, great. Thank you, everybody, for taking the time, and we look forward to reporting to you next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marc Montagner",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We ended 2023 with another strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allow us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Consolidated same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% net year-over-year including impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Of that 3.4%, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation churn. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was consistent with the lower levels of activity we saw during the second and third quarter of 2023. Full year organic leasing contribution to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our previously provided outlook. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn was also in line with our prior expectations and continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. International same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.2% net, including 5.9% of churn or 10.1% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 8% on a constant currency basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to [carrier] (ph) consolidation. During the fourth quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our tower portfolio, acquiring 23 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $21.3 million. We also built 138 new sites. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have purchased under agreement to acquire 281 sites in all of our existing markets for an aggregate price of $87.8 million. We anticipate closing on this site under contract by the end of the third quarter. Looking ahead, this afternoon, earnings press release includes our initial outlook for the full year 2024. Our outlook reflects a continuation of the reduced level of carrier CapEx that began early last year. Despite this, our leasing business will continue to grow organically through contribution from new leases amendment and contracted escalators. Domestically, our outlook assumes $55 million of customer churn in 2024, of which approximately $30 million related to Sprint related decommissioning. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint related churn over the next several years remain largely unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in 2026 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. Internationally, our outlook includes approximately $22 million churn in 2024. During the fourth quarter of '23, we signed a multiyear agreement with Vivo in Brazil. Under this agreement, we expect to incur $4 million wireless consolidation churn in 2024 and an additional $2 million over the next several years. Total anticipated wireless consolidated churn remains at approximately $30 million. Additionally, our full year 2024 outlook reflects a year-over-year decline in service revenue and gross profit due to the lower overall carrier activity in the US. However, our outlook is in line with the historical performance, excluding our very strong result in 2022 and '23 due to the initial rollout of 5G network by some of our wireless customers during these years. This outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract and does not assume any share repurchase. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets and/or share repurchase during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and core FFO and FFO per share include the recent refinancing of our term loan B debt, the upsize of our credit facility and the future [refinancing up with rerating rate] (ph) in the future of our $620 million ABS tower securities maturing in October 2024. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we have ample liquidity. In January of 2024, we refinanced our $2.3 billion credit facility, pushing out the maturity to 2031. We also increased our revolver capacity by $500 million. Our $2 billion revolver is almost fully paid down. Our leverage remains at historical lows and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5 turns, giving us plenty of dry powder for opportunistic acquisition and/or share repurchase. Lastly, we purchased a forward-starting interest rate swap in the fourth quarter. This will give us great certainty around great uncertainty on future interest costs. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional detail."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. I am pleased for the opportunity to reflect on our 2023 performance and to share our thoughts about 2024 and beyond. 2023 was a year marked by some significant macro headwinds, in particular, the consistently high interest rate environment that not only directly affected SBA's floating rate debt costs and the views around our cost of future refinancing, but also impacted our customers and their network spending levels. In spite of these macro headwinds, SBA executed extremely well and produced solid financial results. When compared against the initial outlook for 2023, given in February of last year, our actual results for the year finished materially above the high end of the ranges given for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Most of the outperformance was organic as we spent very little incremental discretionary CapEx in comparison to our initial outlook. Our excess free cash flow was instead largely spent on paying down our floating rate revolver debt, and we finished the year at a multi-decade low leverage level of 6.3 times and today have a current revolver balance of only $70 million. Internally, it was a year of leadership transition for the company. Jeff Stoops retirement, the addition of Marc Montagner to the team and new leaders in our international, legal and IT functions. Everyone has stepped up extremely well into their roles, and I am very happy with how the team is collaborating and performing. The disciplined succession planning and highly capable team members assembled throughout the organization have positioned us well for the future. As we look forward to 2024, we recognize that we are coming off of a period of reduced network investment by our largest domestic customers. However, future network needs for each of these customers remain significant, and we anticipate being a critical partner for our customers in meeting their operational goals and objectives. A significant percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades, which we are confident will take place over the next couple of years. In addition, the success and growth of fixed wireless access as a product offering for our customers will add greater demand for increased network capacity as the average user of this product uses 20 times or more broadband data than the typical mobile customer. And the evolution of AI-infused 5G offerings will continue to fuel the demand for improved speeds and lower latency. All of these factors as well as good old-fashioned service-based competition are supportive of steady organic leasing activity on our US assets for years to come. Internationally, we also see a dynamic of significant network needs, providing a backdrop for continued solid organic leasing activity throughout many of our markets. Financial pressures have impacted many of our international customers as well but the demand for advanced wireless products and services is significant, and in a number of cases, even greater than that seen in the US. We expect this will in turn drive continued demand for incremental space at our tower sites. Nonetheless, there have been customer consolidations in several of our markets. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary efficiencies in their operations, but while preserving the breadth of our business relationships, and solidifying our contractual commitments for the long term. While this temporarily leads to elevated churn, we believe the long-term strength and stability of our cash flow streams produced as a result of these efforts meaningfully improves our go-forward value proposition. This is a good segue into my views around our forward strategy. Internally, we are highlighting a desire to analyze everything we do or consider doing through the lens of stabilizing our results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. While this is not materially different than the approach SBA has taken throughout its history, we recognize that not all of our assets or business lines fit well within this goal. As a result, we are doing the work to evaluate our full portfolio and develop action plans around how we improve our position in each business line and in each market. For instance, in our international operations, we have found it to be valuable to be a market leader in the markets we operate in. In places where we hold a more significant position, we have tended to do better than those places where we do not. This ultimately means that we need to find a path to increase scale in certain markets or possibly exit a market. An example of this was our fourth quarter exit from Argentina. Not only was our market position subscale, but the economic instability in that country created operational challenges that were dilutive to the otherwise typically very attractive attributes of the tower business. We will pursue incremental investments to drive continued growth as we always have. But we will prioritize either an overall favorable shift in the quality and stability of our asset mix or an opportunistic investment that improves our standing and existing markets. Financial results always matter. We will be disciplined toward producing the best possible financial results over the long term. We believe high-quality assets ultimately produce that result. We also believe that when opportunities for incremental asset investments are not available, stock repurchases and debt reductions are worthwhile uses of capital. We intend to continually evaluate our optimal capital structure, and we'll look to balance the lowest cost of capital with retaining appropriate investment flexibility. Our attention to optimize capitalization of the company has placed us in what I believe is the best position in the industry. We are the fastest dividend grower, but yet have the greatest retained AFFO post dividend to invest in the business. We have maintained an average cost of debt very close to our larger peers, but have retained access to up to two turns more leverage. We have recently extended and expanded our revolver capacity by $500 million, creating increased liquidity. This structure provides us with significant optionality to move in whichever direction we believe will provide the best return for our shareholders. The strength and stability of our core tower business remains and it provides a tremendous foundation for all future endeavors. As a result, I have great confidence in our ability to create future value for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers for their support and their confidence in SBA. I also want to thank our team members for their contributions to our success. And with that, Eric, we are ready to take questions. Yeah. So Rick, on the leverage side, we're at 6.3 times mostly because we believe that throughout the last year, the best use of our capital was into paying down that floating rate debt that we had with some of the highest cost debt in our structure. And we didn't necessarily see opportunities that we thought were a better use of capital. but we're comfortable at a higher level of leverage if we see the right place to use that capital. That may include some amount of stock buybacks, but it also obviously would include quality acquisitions if we see that opportunity. So really, what we're doing is, we're retaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet to go in whichever direction we think produces the best result. We don't feel that we have to stay at this level, but if we do, that's fine too. On the M&A front, yeah, it's one of the aspects of what we look for when we're looking at a new market or even at opportunities within some of our existing markets where we're perhaps not a market leader in terms of our position is to be a leader, if we can in terms of our size and importance to our customers. We used to just assume that we look at all opportunities that are available throughout the globe, frankly, as they come available, and we consider that among a number of other factors where we're looking at that. I can't really speak to anything specific that we're looking at, but there definitely are opportunities out there. Yeah. The time frame from signing something to when it actually gets into revenue is still pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. Obviously, it's a little bit longer for a brand-new lease when we sign that. That's usually a good six months or more on the amendments, it's typically shorter, closer to three months, but it depends on the specific circumstances. So that's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. In terms of the pacing throughout the year, our projections, if you look at our bridge in terms of what we've put forth as contributions, and I assume you're asking about domestic specifically. But domestically, that number should be a little bit more front-end loaded today because it's based on activity that we've seen throughout last year and that's kind of rolling over. And at this point, we're not necessarily forecasting a material pickup in activity. But to the extent there is that pickup in activity, it's mostly going to impact next year. Yeah. On your first question, there's no specific plans to exit anything -- to exit the data centers or anything else in particular. But I will tell you that we are applying the same lens to everything that we do as we kind of evaluate these various things, whether it's international markets or its other product lines. And we look at that through a financial lens and what the future can be, opportunities to grow it, what are the synergies with our base core business. I mean, ultimately, we're a tower company, how do things fit in with that. As we go through that analysis, we may come to the conclusion with something that we should exit it, but we may also come to the conclusion that we should grow it too. So at this stage, it's premature to say that we would make a decision one way or the other, but you should assume that we're looking at each of our holdings through that lens. With regard to Brazil, we did actually -- I don't know if you recall, Jon, but last year, we announced about a year ago at this time that we had entered into an agreement with TIM related to the Oi consolidation and it actually pulled forward some of the churn into 2023 associated with that consolidation, but it dealt with a number of other issues and extended agreements out. So we already have something largely in place with Tim. In the case of Claro, there's currently nothing in place, but we're constantly in discussions with them and it may or may not lead to something, but we're talking with them about what would be best for them and for us. Yeah. It basically means your relevance in the market to your customers, which generally means the size and scale of your operations. So the percentage of the portfolio that you represent for the larger, most important customers in that market. When you are at a level that is frankly immaterial to their network needs, your ability to drive additional business and to negotiate terms on new opportunities is just not as great as when you're a more meaningful partner. So that's really what I mean when I talk about the size and scale. As it relates to new markets, that would be a consideration, obviously, before we go into the new market, what's our position going to look like in that market. So it doesn't mean that we would not go into a new market, but we would consider that factor as one of the factors when we're thinking about it. Well, yeah, it could. Obviously, we're just above $40 million now for this year. So if we don't see any pickup as we get to the second half of the year, I do expect that the run rate at the end of the year today, that's implied in our guidance would be slightly below $40 million. So it's possible. I think though some of this is lumpiness in the way that things come in under our AT&T MLA agreement. So the fact that it's a little higher in the first part of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year could be something we see next year as well. Yeah. Yeah. On that item, David, I mean, really the thinking was that we sort of took half of it and created some level of certainty given that there's some instability, obviously, in what interest rates will look like. And we've seen -- we've all seen over the last few months, expectations of when interest rate cuts are going to happen, move around quite a bit. So for us, we basically ensure that a portion of that debt, we would have some stability and certainty on it. And it locks in basically at much lower rate than exists today. So if we let the other piece flow, I think we can have a good natural hedge in that case. On your other questions on the use of cash in our guidance, we do -- because there will be cash that's obviously accumulated, part of it first goes into paying down the revolver, of course, what's left outstanding on that and it covers some of the discretionary spending that is implied in our guidance for deals that are under contract as well as new builds, the items that are basically covered in our discretionary CapEx guidance. Anything excess is assumed to be invested at about a 4% or so interest rate. So that is implied in our net cash interest guidance, some interest income on that. And then I think your other question was the M&A versus buybacks and the timing. I mean, we -- there's a variety of things that we're constantly looking at. And the timing of M&A transactions, you don't have as much control over. Obviously, we have complete control over buybacks. And so -- to some degree, we have to balance the capital that we have available and that we may or may not need. And so sometimes we can jump in earlier. If we have a clear vision as to what's going to happen and other times, we have to hold back a little bit and see how things play out. So I hear what you're saying, and we obviously believe our stock is a good buy at this level that we've got to balance that against all the different options in front of us. Yeah. So, Mike, the numbers that we typically report on, we report on because we think they're the most important. I think the number one metric in our view here and with our Board and frankly, with many of our investors is AFFO per share because it represents that amount of actual free cash flow that is available to be returned to shareholders in some form or fashion, whether that be reinvested into the business, or be paid out as a dividend or be used for stock buybacks, whatever the usage is, it's effectively what's available at the end of the day after everything has been paid for. And so that's the metric that we focus on most of all. Having said that, obviously, the next few years, there are some challenges to our AFFO per share metric, largely because of two things that are not new. Interest rates, we've done an excellent job over the last many years locking in very low-cost debt, but the market is what it is. And at some point, you have to refinance at least some of that debt. And so you're going to see higher interest costs that weighs on that a little bit. And of course, the Sprint churn, in particular, that is kind of out there that we know we have ahead of us, and we've scoped for you as to what that looks like. But outside of that, the real goal, frankly, is to see that number go up over an extended period of time. This is a business that is a very long-term business at its core. We have very long-term contracts. Our relationships are long term. The assets are long term. And so we look at how we're going to maximize that number over an extended period of time. As a public company, it can be challenging because you're reporting every single quarter, and so it gets scrutinized every quarter, but the nature of the business is long term. So we try to take that long-term view on how we're going to grow that number out over a period of five to 10 years. And I think we'll be well positioned to do that. The other metrics though are very important as well. Obviously, growing site leasing revenue, growing adjusted EBITDA shows that we're able to find continued returns on our operations, but really AFFO per share is where I focus most of my energy. And then I guess your second question was about the upgrade percentage for 5G. We're a little bit over halfway in terms of upgrades to our sites for 5G, but that is different among the different carriers. Some are much further along and others are below that number. So we still have a pretty good runway. I think we're looking at the next two to three years to get to where they've upgraded all the sites they need to. Sure. Yeah, the M&A market is still quite competitive. In the US, in particular, because there's such a limited number of assets available, they're very competitively bid. So we continue to see price points that are very high. Internationally, that is also true, although I would say we've seen a little more moderation with the increasing cost of capital in terms of international price points. But the interesting thing about that is what it's resulted in is not necessarily deals being done at lower prices in many cases, but frankly, deals not getting done at all where there's sort of a disconnect between where seller expectations are and where buyers are willing to pay. I think you'll start to see some of that shift over the course of the coming year, particularly if the interest rate environment remains elevated. In the case of DISH, yeah, they are certainly a component of our assumptions for our leasing growth for this year. They have -- they do have the deadlines that you mentioned, and we've had ongoing conversations with them, and we believe that they will be attacking those obligations aggressively. So we do have some amount of growth in our model associated with DISH. But I would say it's a relatively small percentage of the total. Sure. I'll take the second one first. The 281 aren't necessarily all closed at this point. They're either -- I think a few are closed, but most are just under contract at this point. And about 10% of those are in the US. The remaining 90% are located throughout our existing markets in half a dozen different countries that we're already in. In the case of the way we're thinking about the strategic review, it's really -- it's not necessarily emerging markets versus developed although that can be a factor. It's a focus on how we maximize our position in those markets. So we have positions in emerging markets that are very strong because of the strength of our role and our existing relationships with the strongest carriers in those markets. And so if we can enhance that in places where we don't have it, then I think we would be comfortable with the markets regardless of whether they were necessarily developed or emerging markets. However, I think developed markets do offer some aspects of quality that we would find attractive if we can find the right opportunities, things like strong tower siding, regulatory regimes, certainly strength of the wireless carriers in the market and a relative balance to their market share, stability of the currency, stability of the tax regime, things like that would be things that we would find valuable. Because at the end of the day, sort of the value proposition of a tower company when most people look at it is this expectation that you have a long-term, very stable cash flow stream that is going to grow both steadily over time. And sometimes if you're in places that don't have some of those attributes I just mentioned, you can introduce a certain amount of volatility that we would be looking to obviously try to move out of the mix and focus more on that kind of stable growing cash flow stream. So I think we're open to shift in the type of market, but I think the markets that we're in have opportunities to improve our positioning and that's what we're looking at. It's something that I would expect us to be working on throughout this year, but there are also factors that are outside of our control, things that we would like to do. That may take some time to figure out whether the opportunity is actually exist. So I think it will be an ongoing effort. But the real point -- and this isn't some wholesale change just to kind of reiterate that. It's not like we were doing something totally one way before, we completely shifted. This is more of a refinement of the approach that SBA has historically taken. We've always -- I think you know us to have always focused on quality, financial returns. All those things are still the same. What this really is, is kind of digging in a little bit deeper on some of our current holdings and looking at where we're underperforming, what are the root causes of that and what can we do to address that? And if we can't -- if we don't feel we can address it, then we would look at it like Argentina and say, \"Hey, this we don't think we necessarily can fix so we'll adjust\". So again, it's really just a refinement of what has been our long-standing policy. Yeah. The services revenue, we actually, in our outlook, expect it to slightly increase, but to be relatively balanced throughout the year. On the colos versus amendments, if you're -- I don't know if you're asking about the actuals of the fourth quarter, where it was more -- we've seen more of a shift towards new leases, but I would expect as we get into this year, you'll see amendment activity again be the lion's share of what we do. Yeah. It was -- it represented about $1 million of EBITDA and a little over $2 million, about $2.3 million of revenue on an annual basis. So on holistic MLAs, I think that is a -- when we talk about a goal of trying to ensure that we have stabilized our cash flow streams and results, one of the ways you do that is through enhancing and improving customer relationships. And that can be done in part through master agreements. We obviously signed one with AT&T last year. We've signed others in the past with each of our customers along the way. So I would expect we will continue to make use of that, assuming that it's the best structure for what our customers need to get done and SBA is able to achieve a certain amount of certainty and length of commitment as part of those agreements. But each of those will be determined on an individual basis based on the needs of the customer and what we need. Again, the buybacks versus M&A, yeah, I mean, we are -- we're not necessarily sitting here saying we've got all this cash we're ready to spend on buybacks. We are -- in fact, we still have balances out on our revolver. So I don't feel like we've necessarily been in that position. We have historically been very opportunistic around share buybacks. I would expect that to continue to be the case now. But individual acquisition opportunities, particularly of size, may influence our timing on when we would buy back our stock if we otherwise saw it as an attractive investment. So that's where we are, and we'll see as time goes by. But just because you don't see us buy back our stock doesn't necessarily mean that we don't see it as a good value. It means there may be other factors we're considering. Yeah. I can't tell you exactly with precision sitting here, but I'm sure we can follow up with you. It is largely based on what's already been signed up to date. I'm sure it's somewhere in the three quarters range of the number, but maybe even more. So we'll follow up with you, Brendan, separately on that. Yeah. So I mentioned it briefly in my prepared comments, but there are a number of markets that we're in where we have consolidations taking place, in particular, in Brazil where you had the Oi wireless consolidation with the other big three carriers there as we kind of work through that. Last year, that was a big factor. It represented roughly 40%. It was just from 10% by itself, associated with that consolidation, there's one item. That is probably going to be a continued driver of some level of international churn over the next few years. But we're working through negotiations with each of our customers. And as we do that, we're kind of pricing this long-term relationship, long-term commitment where we've got stability that we can reintroduce into the relationship, but allow them to get through the efficiencies that they need to achieve as a result of the combination of customers that's taking place in the market. So it's a mix, but Brazil will probably be the biggest just because it's the biggest market we have with the most revenue. Yes, I probably can't answer that in this forum, Walt. But we do have ongoing conversations with them about all different things that they do that we do that might fit together. So -- go ahead. Well, it's probably coincidental to some degree. I don't think you'd see us go above 8x at any point in our history. But now that we've got this -- we've got a pretty big cushion given where our leverage has come down to. So I don't really foresee that ever being a number that we approach. Well, what -- I mean, really what gives me confidence, but we'll see how it plays out, its history. I mean, every time we've seen the cycle of activity, it's ultimately gotten to the suburban markets, the rural markets. Those dense urban centers really were never tower markets to begin with. So it's not really been a factor for us. Anything that's getting resolved with root tops, that's a very limited tower market. So I'm not sure it matters that much to us. Sure. So the leasing level into the future, yeah, we think it could go up, sure. Obviously, it's all driven by carrier activity. I mean if you go back over the last three years, David, you will see, if you go back a few years ago, that we were at a level very similar to where we are now. In fact, I think we reported a number lower than the $42 million that we just put in our outlook for this year, three, four years ago. So since that time, obviously, it spiked up much higher than that because of carrier activity. And I think to some degree, the network strain that they may feel the -- and the cost of capital is very impactful to the decisions they're making there. And so yes, we believe there's definitely opportunity to see the number go higher in future years, but we need to see how that moves. In the case of -- I'm sorry, your other question was on CapEx? Yeah. I think -- I don't believe -- I believe what we guided to was similar to what last year's number was. Yeah it's where we guided to, $330 million at the midpoint and last year, it was $310 million. So sorry, Dave, what do you -- what's the core of the question? Okay. All right. Thanks. Sure. With regards to AT&T FirstNet, for the most part, I would expect, based on my understanding of everything that is expected to happen there, that it would have limited upside for us from an amendment or upgrade standpoint, the opportunity set would be more based on a need to densify where they needed to actually have new lease agreements at existing sites or possibly even new tower builds. So it's really a new site leasing opportunity to the extent that there is an impact, but I do not think there's much of an amendment impact potential for us. With regards to the M&A question, we would -- generally speaking, I would say we would prefer independent tower company towers as opposed to carrier owned towers, usually, we find that they've been developed with the mindset of co-location already in there, and they are operated and maintained in a way typically that is better than what you find with the traditional carrier sale leaseback. But having said that, we've done both kinds of deals, and I think our what we bring to the table is our expertise that allows us to kind of improve those operations. Sometimes there's greater opportunity for improvement when you buy things that haven't been run quite as well. So I guess it just depends on the individual opportunity. Well, great. Thank you, everybody, for taking the time, and we look forward to reporting to you next quarter."

And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another very solid quarter in Q3, with financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share, notwithstanding weaker forecasted foreign currency exchange rates than we had previously expected. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $637.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $630.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a headwind of approximately $1.4 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, and a benefit of $4.8 million when compared to the third quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the third quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8.6% on a gross basis, and 4.7% on a net basis, including 3.9% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was up materially from the second quarter, primarily as a result of the AT&T master lease agreement signed in July. Excluding the impact of the AT&T MLA, third quarter activity levels were similar to the second quarter. All major carriers remain active with their networks. However, agreement execution levels continue to be slower than a year ago. The higher cost of capital naturally has caused a focus on cash management and expense control by our customers. This dynamic extends the timing over which 5G-related network investments are being made. There is still a long way to go for 5G network investments based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. Wireless data use continues to grow materially, and that fact, combined with the limited spectrum availability will require additional infrastructure over time to maintain and certainly to enhance service quality. This gives us great confidence in continued domestic organic leasing growth for many years to come. During the third quarter, domestic churn was slightly below our prior projections due to a slower pace of decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected. Our overall expectations for Sprint related churn remain the same, but there will likely continue to be small variations in timing of realizing this churn over the next several years. We currently expect Sprint related churn for 2023 to be $28 million. 2024 Sprint related churn is currently estimated to be approximately $30 million. Non-Sprint related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections and continues to range between 1% and 2% of our domestic leasing revenue. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, third quarter same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.5% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.4% on a gross basis. International leasing activity remained strong in the third quarter and was again ahead of our internal expectations. While global macroeconomic conditions present challenges to our carrier customers, we have continued to see pockets of dedicated network investment across a number of our markets. The desire and need for enhanced wireless coverage and quality of service continues to be elevated internationally, and we expect will continue to drive leasing opportunities across our portfolio. Wireless data growth in our international markets is even greater than the U.S. We also continue to see steady contributions from inflation-based escalators in many of our markets. In Brazil, our largest international market, the same-tower organic growth rate was 2.6% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 6.3% of churn, which growth rate reflects a decline in the Brazilian inflationary index. The net growth rate was also again significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than that associated with the TIM agreement. However, we continue to discuss potential arrangements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that could have an impact on our current year international churn. During the third quarter, 77.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $511.7 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.3%, and an international tower cash flow margin of 70%, or 91.5% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $482.1 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.4% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business had another solid quarter, with $45.1 million in revenue, and $13.6 million of segment operating profit. While off last year's all-time high activity levels, we continued to execute on our backlog of high quality, high margin work and deliver for our carrier customers. However, given the slower pace of carrier network related activity across the industry, we have lowered our full year outlook for our site development business by $15 million at the midpoint. Notwithstanding this adjustment, we continue to manage our costs and focus on high-margin work. And thus, we have not lowered our expected margin contributions to 2023 adjusted EBITDA and AFFO from our services business. We still expect 2023 to be the second largest services revenue year in our history, trailing only 2022. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the third quarter was $364.1 million. AFFO per share was $3.34, an increase of 7.7% over the third quarter of 2022. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 45 communication sites for total cash consideration of $40.8 million, and building 86 new sites. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 215 sites, all of which are in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $74 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of 2024. In addition to new towers, we also continued to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Before I turn things over to Mark, I'd like to take a quick moment to welcome Marc Montagner, who joined our team in mid-October, and will be taking over as our new CFO on January 1. Marc brings with him an extensive background in telecommunications and finance, and we are very excited to have him as part of the team. I also would be remiss if I did not take a moment to recognize that this call is Jeff's final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have big shoes to fill, and I am grateful for the professional guidance and the friendship he has extended to me over the last 25 years. And with that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt, and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4x, 0.2 turns lower than last quarter, and the lowest level of decades. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense increased to 5.1x. During and subsequent to quarter-end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $285 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.2 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%. Including our interest rate hedging position, the interest rate on 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During and subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $100 million at an average price per share of $197.89. We currently have $404.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company\u2019s shares outstanding at September 30, 2023 were $108.1 million. In addition, during the quarter we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million, or $0.85 per share. And today we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.85 per share that\u2019s payable on December 14, 2023 to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 26% of our projected full year AFFO. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. We continue to execute well in the third quarter. We produced financial results ahead of external and internal expectations. And we continue to be a valued partner to our carrier customers in helping them to meet their network objectives. Each of our largest U.S. customers continued to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. Although current activity levels are below the pace of the last couple of years, we have continued to steadily organically grow our revenues and tower cash flow. Even in a slower than typical demand environment wireless carriers still have a constant need to invest in expanding and enhancing their networks. By leveraging our high quality assets and providing them quality services support, we have been able to continue growing our business relationship with each of our major customers. In addition, we are confident there will be additional material network investment over the next several years as wireless data usage continues to grow materially. The growth in wireless demand is not slowing down and networks will continue to be strained and our customers still have significant mid-band spectrum holdings that need to be deployed with little additional spectrum plan for release anytime soon. Macro tower sites are still the most efficient and effective way to deliver wireless connectivity, and our focus on high quality portfolio will make us a key participant in network growth for many years to come. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. We again experienced strong contributions broadly from many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was again ahead of our internal expectations, and each of the big three carriers in that market remained busy with coverage expansion, densification and integration of the legacy Oi wireless network. Lease up across many of our Central American markets was also ahead of expectations and evidences the need of our customers to meet the constantly growing demand of wireless customers for wireless data in those markets. I am pleased with our operational execution internationally, and I am optimistic for the future based on significant network needs across many of our markets. During the third quarter, we again generated very healthy AFFO, providing strong dividend coverage and significant cash for discretionary allocation. During the quarter, we allocated capital to the dividend and new site additions through both acquisitions and new tower builds, selectively adding high quality sites that we believe will be additive to our organic growth in future years. We also spent $100 million on share repurchases at prices we believe represent a very good value and will produce a nice return over time. We also continue paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefited from this by reducing some of our highest rate cash interest obligations. The reduction in our outstanding debt, along with our continued solid growth in adjusted EBITDA produced a quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.4x, which I believe is the lowest level ever in our public company history. Even with continued portfolio growth, stock repurchases and growing dividends, we have reduced our leverage by almost one full turn in the last 18 months, demonstrating the deleveraging power of our business. At this leverage level, we believe we have the near-term optionality to achieve an investment grade rating. However, for the time being, we are maintaining flexibility in order to comfortably assess all capital allocation options. Going forward, we expect to continue growing our dividend at a rate higher than the rate of growth of our AFFO over the next several years, while maintaining a low AFFO payout ratio. For the time being, excess future cash flows will likely be directed into the repayment of debt, as it is the most accretive short-term and is also beneficial long-term, but we will of course, also stay opportunistic around portfolio opportunities and additional stock buybacks. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024, and we have the capacity to satisfy that repayment entirely with cash flow from operations or availability under our revolver. We continue to have very good access to capital, and thus are comfortable to be opportunistic around the timing of future financings. Overall, we feel very good about our current capital position. As Brendan mentioned earlier, this represents my final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have participated in approximately 100 of these calls over the years. I have been honored to be the leader of this organization for the past 22 years and appreciative of the time I have spent with many of you on this call. Thank you for your support and goodwill throughout this very enjoyable ride. I will retire with the comfort and satisfaction of knowing SBA is a great company, in great shape, and with a management team that I know will lead it to new heights. I want to conclude by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And one moment please for our first question. And our first question goes to Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. And Jeff, I want to wish you all the best. And maybe a question for you given your tenure in the industry. Your company and many of your peers have seen kind of a lot of changes. I think your company at one point was doing shared wireless backhaul. You\u2019ve gone into data centers, you\u2019ve evaluated things like outdoor DAS. But anything about the sector as you see it on your way out of the company as an active observer, I imagine. But any kind of broad brush structural changes that you see affecting the tower model or anything ancillary to that that we should be looking for as investors? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: I would say over my 25, 26 years, Jon, there\u2019s been a steady connection between growth in wireless demand and necessary infrastructure. And I think that really has its roots in the laws of physics and the way radio spectrum works. We\u2019ve seen cycles that have repeated themselves over time. The current cycle feels like it\u2019s going to be a bit more elongated than perhaps some of the prior cycles, as I think our customers are demonstrating. Not that they didn\u2019t demonstrate fiscal prudence over the years, but it seems to be a particularly higher priority than racing to deploy spectrum, which they will own, and deploy it when they need it. But the basics haven\u2019t really changed that much. We haven\u2019t seen any technology that really will obsolete the basic tower business model. We watch satellites and things like that, and we watch small cells. And the macro site really continues to be the backbone of wireless communications. And the conversations we have with our customers tell us that they expect macro sites to continue to be the backbone. So I think there\u2019s always ups and downs and twists and turns, but directionally it remains pretty much the way it was many years ago.\nJon Atkin: Great. That\u2019s great perspective. And thinking forward over the next year or so, Brendan, I guess would be directed towards you. But kind of the operating trends and the demand drivers, any sense as to kind of the cadence that one might see as this spectrum gets further deployed and the kind of the 5G journey continues on behalf of the M&Os?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think, Jon, we\u2019ll see in the early part of heading into next year that things will probably be lower than they\u2019ve been. But I would expect to see that increase over time. And it really base that answer mostly on the needs that our customers have. There's still quite a bit of spectrum that has to be deployed on our sites. There are some deadlines out there for certain of our customers that they need to meet. And just based on conversations that we have with them, suggest that there's still a ton of work to be done. But I think, as Jeff kind of alluded to, in the current moment in time, there's a little bit more of a focus on financial constraints and cost control. But I think that naturally will start to give way to network needs as mobile and wireless data consumption increases. So, I would expect that we'll see it start to move up as we get into the middle of next year.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much and all the best, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question goes to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks, good afternoon everybody. Jeff, I think I've been on 96 of those 100 earnings calls with you. So I'll echo Jonathan's comments. And have fun with the grandkids and your charity work I know you're so active with.\nJeff Stoops: Well, thank you, Ric. We had a good run together.\nRic Prentiss: Yes. I want to come to a couple of items. The dividend policy. I appreciate the comments on that, dividend rate over the growth rate of AFFO. Some of the others in the space are looking at the dividend policy, should it be tied more towards the qualified REIT subsidiary, kind of minimum that you have to do versus total AFFO. How should we think about you all looking at kind of the dividend versus qualified REIT subsidiary versus total AFFO, and as you think about the payout ratio over time?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We're fortunate to be in the position that we're in, where we actually still have fairly sizable NOLs, which gives us some flexibility there, Ric. But as \u2013 you kind of look at it as, you produce a certain amount of taxable income, and we satisfy it through a mix of using NOLs and paying out dividends and in order to maintain our REIT compliance. And so by starting when we did, it has allowed us to continue to grow our dividend at a pace that I think is fairly high across most REITs, and will allow us to continue to do that to some degree, it's certainly at a pace greater than the AFFO per share growth. Until we reach a point at which we will have exhausted those NOLs, and at that point, I would expect we'll pay a dividend that is \u2013 whatever is necessary to comply with our REIT requirements. So that's kind of the way we look at it. What that means, based on our projections is that we'll continue to have nice growth in our dividend over the coming years. And we'll be able to keep our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO fairly low, which gives us a lot of flexibility on other discretionary uses for that capital.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think, Rick, the reason we haven't broken out total AFFO versus just AFFO from requalifying income that dividend is calculated, is we're not close to any of those levels. I mean, I think our philosophy will never change, which is we're only going to pay out what we have to on that calculation. And it also kind of confuses people if we introduced another metric. It's just, I think, easier for people to understand and think about when we're using AFFO. But we have a long way to go before we get to the point where we've exhausted our NOLs. And that gives us the ability to increase dividends faster than perhaps others. But at the same time, we're watching the total payout as a percentage of AFFO. And we're going to be able to do both, keep a lower relative payout ratio and increase the dividend at a faster pace for the next several years.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. You mentioned that you think, possibly, the levels you're at lowest, decades, if not, ever publicly in the mid-6% range. How should we think about what investment grade means to you, if you were to pursue it? What kind of level \u2013 you've always been kind of a levered capital appreciation story. But obviously, the interest rate environment we're in has caused people to always look through things. But how should we think about your view on leverage and interest rates? And then that calculus that allowed you to do stock buyback this quarter?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So as you alluded to, obviously, the broader environment, in terms of rates and cost of capital, is certainly influencing the trajectory of our leverage levels lately. And really, it's a combination of a couple of things. It's the overall cost, but it's also the relationship to the opportunities in front of us in terms of investing capital and what we see as the potential return on those items. And we haven't seen an appropriate adjustment, I guess, in the price points for some of that investment relative to the shift in the cost of capital. And so as a result, the best use of the cost of capital, most of the time, is to pay off some of our debt. And as you know, we had balances outstanding on our revolver. And so it's easy for us to just pay that down as the use of capital, and given that it's floating rate, it's some of our highest cost debt. So we will continue to do that. But at the same time, we're going to look to be opportunistic around opportunities to invest that capital, and the stock buybacks are representative of that. We started to see our stock trading down to levels where we just felt that it was an appropriate time to jump in, and it would be certainly accretive to us. Both in the short term and over the long term, we would expect to invest a little bit of capital into the buyback. So I think, as we think forward, longer term, we haven't necessarily targeted being investment grade, but the leverage has continued to drop. And that's one of the great things about this business, you continue to grow EBITDA, and it naturally \u2013 as we produce a lot of free cash flow, you naturally start to delever quickly. And so we're approaching those levels now where we certainly could move towards investment grade. But as we mentioned in our scripted comments, we are going to maintain that flexibility for the time being and see how things go. And if we decide that, that's a better way to go in terms of improving our cost of capital, then we have that optionality to do it. And if not, and there's other places to invest that we think are going to produce greater returns for our shareholders, we'll go that direction.\nRic Prentiss: Great. One quick one on my end. I think you mentioned Sprint share now expected to be $30 million in 2024. Has that previously been thought it was going to be kind of in the double digit, maybe $10 million to $15 million? And settling \u2013 can you kind of update on what you think of 2025, 2026, 2027 Sprint churns [ph]?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think last quarter, we gave you a range that was around $20 million to $30 million. And so by saying $30 million now, we're seeing it a little bit lower here as we end this year. But the total is still the same. When we originally were giving guidance, we expected to see a little bit more in 2025 and 2026. And now we're thinking 2025 is probably a little bit lower. So again, the total number is going to be basically the same, Ric. It's just trying to pinpoint exactly the timing from year-to-year is \u2013 it's been a little bit challenging to do with that kind of precision. But I think we've been pretty close.\nRic Prentiss: Right. Okay. Again, best wishes, Jeff and Marc. Look forward to hearing Marc with the CFO. Look forward to hearing from you next quarter.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Ric.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. And Jeff, also my best, will miss you on these calls and your insights on the industry. A couple of things. You talked a lot about the demand being subdued, given the financial conditions in the market. To what extent are things like the FCC not having the spectrum authority to release some spectrum, the dual-band radio issue. Do you think any of those might get solved here in the near term that might be holding back some spending, or even just a turn off the calendar from year-end 2023 and to 2024? And then you did some M&A in the quarter. It would be great just to get some broader thoughts on the M&A environment. I think we've heard in the past, just a big difference between public and private multiples, but it'd be great to get any color on what you were able to find in the market and what you see out there today? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think the FCC spectrum authority issue has to be resolved here soon. At the same time, the FCC has lost their spectrum authority. The White House and other governmental agencies are trying to plot and figure out long-term spectrum availability. So \u2013 and everybody knows it needs to get done, and it will. And I believe, by the time it has been done or will be done, Simon, the dual-band 3.45 and C-band equipment will be ready to go. So that's absolutely something that we think will contribute to next year's leasing. But there's a lot of spectrum still, and we think about things as a percentage of completion or deployment of certain spectrum bands on our towers. There's just a lot left to go. And I think it just shows that our customers are being fiscally prudent and waiting and looking for the right return results before they deploy. But ultimately, they have to deploy, unless the connection between growth in wireless data and the need for physical infrastructure has somehow changed, and that hasn't changed since the beginning of wireless. I'll let Brendan handle your M&A question.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the M&A environment, we continue to see a very competitive environment. Notwithstanding where public valuations have gone, private valuations continue to remain elevated. And to the comments that I made earlier, that's obviously influence where we've directed some of our capital. So in the U.S., in particular, pricing is staying high. And even internationally, we're seeing that to some degree. Although I would say, internationally, there's perhaps been less in the market. There's still a ton out there of potential supply, but I think that sellers are being a little more cautious in their timing of bringing things to market.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question goes to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you so much. Jeff, I wish you all the best as well. I had a question on the leasing growth activity. You mentioned that it has been slowing down. Can you provide some sense if it has slowed down even more than what you had expected a few months ago? And the AT&T MLA is providing some visibility when the activity is coming down. Can you provide some color, maybe if you're \u2013 if there is appetite from your other tenants to replicate similar deals and how you would approach them? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. The leasing growth, I wouldn't say that it's really all that different than what we thought three months ago when we talked about it. It's perhaps slower than what we thought at the beginning of the year than we were originally thinking how this year would play out. But what we described last quarter, it's staying pretty much in line with that expectation that we laid out. And you could see that even in the guidance that we gave, where we didn't make any changes there. On the AT&T MLA and it's the potential for that with others. We have master agreements in place with other carriers. The form of those agreements can vary among the carriers, but it's really dependent upon the needs of that specific customer, and what works best for them and for us and creates the best win-win situation given what they're trying to accomplish in that particular negotiation. So I would say that we are certainly open to agreements with others over time as they're needed, and we have those conversations all the time. Exactly how they're structured may very well vary though, depending on the carriers' needs.\nBatya Levi: Got it. And one quick follow-up; I think you mentioned that the activity on putting 5G equipment on towers is still pretty low. Roughly 1% of your towers have seen that deployment?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Using the 5G-related spectrum it's approximately 50%.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And Jeff, I also want to extend my thanks and best wishes as you move on to your next chapter.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks Mike.\nMichael Rollins: Welcome. And just curious as we shift over to maybe the international side for a few more minutes; have you thought about alternative ways to structure those operations? Or is there a need at some level to adjust the market structure of what you have over time to create greater scale or find some ancillary opportunities for growth in those markets where they may not be structured similar to the U.S.?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't know if it's necessarily structure. I would agree with your reference to scale, that in markets where we have scale, we've seen the benefits of that in our relationships with the carrier customers in those markets, and our ability to be more impactful in their projects for build-outs that they have. So scale is something that we're definitely paying attention to within these markets. And then in terms of other things that we might add, in some of these places, there are opportunities to provide incremental services that are somehow related or associated with what we currently do that add sort of an extra level of value that we're able to provide. It generates additional revenue streams that but it also kind of strengthens that relationship for a longer period of time. So we're exploring that. We're doing some things around C-RAN hubs, some things around power, some things around security in certain of our markets and we'll continue to explore those opportunities.\nMichael Rollins: And just one other question. In past moments where there's been some uncertainty, whether it's in the operating environment or financial environment, the company has provided a North Star in terms of a metric or a guide or an aspiration that you were targeting. And just given some of the questions on leasing activity and what it might mean for growth rates over the next few years, is there a range or an average domestic organic growth rate that SBA is targeting, aspiring to that would be helpful for investors to be mindful of?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No, there's not a specific target. I think, excluding Sprint churn, I would expect that we'll be able to produce mid-single digits growth rate in the U.S. But at this point, we're not comfortable to lay out a long-term target. And some of that, Mike, just to be clear, it's \u2013 there are a lot of factors that really aren't about wireless needs. If it was just about what do our customers need to do in terms of their network deployments, we perhaps would be able to do that a little bit more comfortably. I think some of these factors around cost of capital and other things that may affect timing of when our customers are spending influence that. So that just leads us to be a little bit more cautious in kind of naming specific targets.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey. Jeff, first of all I just want to echo others' comments and thank you for all the time you spent with us, and all the insights you shared with us over the years. I really appreciate that.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks Nick.\nNick Del Deo: Jeff, you emphasized in your comments that the carriers will need to invest to support traffic growth over time, just like they always have. I don't think many people dispute that. I guess, is there any reason to think that they have more capacity runway today than they have typically had over the years, given the amount of 5G spectrum they've rolled out? Or do you not believe that's the case?\nJeff Stoops: I do believe that there's a lot of spectrum out there, which is why now all of the three largest carriers have now all, or either have, or are beginning to deploy fixed wireless. Don't know that, that technology's been available in the last generation, it would have worked out. I mean, just on that point, from some things that I've read, the fixed wireless subscriber takes up 20 times to 30 times the wireless \u2013 the spectrum capacity. So I mean, it's statistics like that, Nick, that give us great confidence that over time, the connection that's existed forever, at least as long as I've been around, the connection between wireless data growth and the need for additional physical infrastructure is going to continue. But yes, I mean there's a lot of spectrum out there now, but it's rapidly getting used up. And it's going to continue to rapidly get used up the more success that the customers have with fixed wireless.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. And then I also thought it was interesting that you lowered your site development revenue forecast, but you left the bottom line contribution unchanged, which implies a pretty \u2013 a not insignificant bump in your expected margin. So I guess, can you talk about what's behind that dynamic and how sustainable it might be as we look into the coming year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't \u2013 I think, Nick, it does speak to the higher-margin type work that we're doing. I'm not sure that it's sustainable at that same level that we are experiencing right at the moment. Some of that is really tied to an estimate of costs as we put these jobs on the books, and we're ending up actually finding ways to operate more efficiently and come in at lower cost levels. And then as you kind of true-up [ph] those jobs, since they're accounted for on a percentage of completion basis that helps. But I think, it just is evidence of our intent to focus on high-quality, high-margin work, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't know that 30% margins are the story for the long-term.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Thank you. I just wanted to echo best wishes for Jeff in retirement. Brendan, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on how you kind of prepare the balance sheet for the debt maturity staff that's coming due in a more material way in 2025. I know you don't have to make a decision on that today whether you'll pursue investment grade. But just how might that impact your capital allocation policy into 2024 as you kind of look at the puts and takes of buybacks, M&A or further deleveraging with excess cash?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, first of all, I think that we have tremendous access to capital. So from a refinancing perspective, I'm not concerned about that. We're actively evaluating all of our options there. And I'm confident that there are numerous markets available to us. Obviously, the costs are higher than they've been in the past. But in terms of access to capital, so that \u2013 that part of it doesn't concern me. I think, when we think about allocation of capital, though, it really is just a matter of what is the best return on investment, what is going to create the most shareholder value. So that sounds simplistic. But ultimately, that's what we're looking at. And so if we can use our capital, and maybe our leverage goes a little bit higher, which it's been in the past, certainly, because we see opportunities to invest that capital into either buybacks or new assets, we'll do that. We'd like to do that. But recently, we found that paying down debt has been the better way to go. And at some point, we'll be at a level where it's just going to be a natural shift. If that doesn't change, will be the natural shift to investment grade. And then it's just a matter of finding the right instruments that fit our capital structure to allow us to retain flexibility, but also get the best cost possible.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think said differently, if we continue to operate the way we have the last couple of quarters, we naturally will have the optionality of being an investment-grade issuer. That really, for us, is not so much more a matter of material leverage reduction as it is commitments and policy changes and things like that. We would, of course, before we materially increase leverage for allocation of capital, we would think long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do in advance of 2025. But it kind of is on a path. And Eric, we think, as we look around the world, look at portfolio pricing and things like that, it's very likely that we end 2024 at a lower leverage level, or certainly not a higher leverage level, than where we end 2023.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. I appreciate that color. And just one follow-up question. Just quickly on domestic churn. I think, excluding the Sprint churn, you'll be at about $30 million this year, maybe around 2% of your revenues. And it's been in that ballpark for the last couple of years. As you look further out over the next few years, are there opportunities to bring that run rate churn level lower? We've heard from some peers about some of their run rate tower churn moving closer to 1% of revenue. Thanks. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I do think, Eric, there's definitely opportunities to bring it lower. For one, a big chunk of that is due to kind of smaller customers that frankly, as you start to have less and less of them or they are less of a percentage of our business, obviously, there's less opportunity or supply for that churn. And then with our agreements with some of our bigger customers, I would expect that any churn that's come from them will be significantly reduced as well.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. Great to hear. Thank you guys. \nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question and Jeff, want to echo everyone's congratulations as well. Maybe we could just start with the international market. You kind of described demand being above your internal expectations. And a component of that, I believe you mentioned, was the escalators. But if I understand correctly, those are more backward looking. So I'd imagine that you have pretty good visibility on that for the year. So maybe you could just get into some of the other drivers that are driving the international exposure and international profitability higher than what you had been expecting?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. The above expectations comment was specifically associated with new leasing revenue signed up through new leases and amendments. And that was \u2013 we kind of obviously target based on backlog, and what our market intelligence is telling us what we think those numbers are going to look like in each market. And on average, across our international business, we were successful in signing up more new business than \u2013 from a dollar standpoint than we originally expected. So that's that comment. And I think it's driven really just by the significant needs that certain of our customers have across our markets for all the basic things that we talked about before, continued expansion of both 4G and even a little bit of 5G coverage. The coverage that exists in these markets is not nearly where it is in the U.S., so there's much greater needs in some cases. And so we're seeing that play out in a number of our markets. The escalator piece is not really a part of that. That varies and just moves based on where inflation is, and in certain of our markets, inflation was \u2013 has been a little bit higher. So that's helped the growth rates stay elevated.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. That's helpful. And maybe just one on the build-to-suit program. You had some more activity there in the quarter. Maybe just give us an update on where you see those opportunities over the next couple of quarters?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think there's \u2013 most of that is being done internationally, first of all. I'm sure you see that in our release. And that will probably continue to be the case. There's definitely opportunities for new builds, for the same reasons as I just mentioned. In responding to the previous question, there's just a lot of coverage needs that exist in these markets. The real question for us is just making sure that we're doing \u2013 we're making worthwhile investments, given the cost of capital that's increased, that we're building sites, that we're confident are going to make a nice return, and that usually requires the addition of a second tenant at some point over the next several years after you build the site. So we're pretty diligent in kind of watching those sites. I think opportunities exist. But we're going to be selective about where we build sites.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead. \nDavid Guarino: Hey, thanks. Brendan, I think this one will be for you. On the comment you made about U.S. tower validation staying high. Could you provide some more color on why you think that is? And I asked just because I guess I'm surprised, given we've had a pretty meaningful rise in interest rates over the last few months. While at the same time, we've had some concerns about lower macro tower growth that have emerged. So any additional color would be great.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think you've got a lot of different parties out there that have demands or their \u2013 their mission is to invest in digital infrastructure. And they have capital that's already been raised that needs to get deployed. And so I think that has \u2013 that plays a role in it. The supply, frankly, in the U.S. is somewhat limited, so there's still some competitive tension that exists there among many different parties that are investing. So that's really a driver. And so if you've got different return expectations, and you've got different views on what the growth profile of assets look like, you may be able to make a decision that's different than we're seeing the public companies, including SBA, make.\nDavid Guarino: Yes. That's helpful. And the second one, maybe sticking with you. I'm guessing next year, you guys are going to be accessing the secured market to refinance some debt. And I know that, that's still a few quarters away. But could you maybe give us an idea of where secured borrowing costs sit today for tower assets?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean it depends on what market you're in. If you're talking about the ABS market, which has been our primary source of secured financing today, you'd be somewhere in the mid- to high 6s, would likely be where we play out.\nDavid Guarino: Great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nBrandon Nispel: Hey, great. Just one for me. And hopefully, it haven't been asked. But Jeff, hope you could talk about what you're seeing during the quarter, more specifically from an activity perspective. Specifically, I was hoping you could help us understand where you are from a year-over-year perspective, from a backlog of unsigned lease applications, and how that trended versus last quarter? Thanks. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, we've \u2013 our backlogs are a little bit lower than they've been in the past. That \u2013 it probably shouldn't be a surprise, given the carriers' investment levels have been little bit slower as we've talked about. And obviously, executions have been down. The backlogs have trended in the same general direction. But it will be interesting to see how that plays out as we get into next year, as the carriers have new budgets in place and so forth. So for now, though, it's definitely trended down.\nBrandon Nispel: Thanks. \nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJeff Stoops: Well, I usually sign off. But I'm going to let Brendan sign off.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, thank you all for joining us. We appreciate it. And thank you, Jeff, again, for all of your years. Appreciate it.\nJeff Stoops: It's been an honor and a privilege. And I'm not able to say, as I have in my last 100, that we \u2013 that I look forward to talking to you next quarter. But you're in good hands.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. We continue to execute well in the third quarter. We produced financial results ahead of external and internal expectations. And we continue to be a valued partner to our carrier customers in helping them to meet their network objectives. Each of our largest U.S. customers continued to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. Although current activity levels are below the pace of the last couple of years, we have continued to steadily organically grow our revenues and tower cash flow. Even in a slower than typical demand environment wireless carriers still have a constant need to invest in expanding and enhancing their networks. By leveraging our high quality assets and providing them quality services support, we have been able to continue growing our business relationship with each of our major customers. In addition, we are confident there will be additional material network investment over the next several years as wireless data usage continues to grow materially. The growth in wireless demand is not slowing down and networks will continue to be strained and our customers still have significant mid-band spectrum holdings that need to be deployed with little additional spectrum plan for release anytime soon. Macro tower sites are still the most efficient and effective way to deliver wireless connectivity, and our focus on high quality portfolio will make us a key participant in network growth for many years to come. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. We again experienced strong contributions broadly from many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was again ahead of our internal expectations, and each of the big three carriers in that market remained busy with coverage expansion, densification and integration of the legacy Oi wireless network. Lease up across many of our Central American markets was also ahead of expectations and evidences the need of our customers to meet the constantly growing demand of wireless customers for wireless data in those markets. I am pleased with our operational execution internationally, and I am optimistic for the future based on significant network needs across many of our markets. During the third quarter, we again generated very healthy AFFO, providing strong dividend coverage and significant cash for discretionary allocation. During the quarter, we allocated capital to the dividend and new site additions through both acquisitions and new tower builds, selectively adding high quality sites that we believe will be additive to our organic growth in future years. We also spent $100 million on share repurchases at prices we believe represent a very good value and will produce a nice return over time. We also continue paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefited from this by reducing some of our highest rate cash interest obligations. The reduction in our outstanding debt, along with our continued solid growth in adjusted EBITDA produced a quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.4x, which I believe is the lowest level ever in our public company history. Even with continued portfolio growth, stock repurchases and growing dividends, we have reduced our leverage by almost one full turn in the last 18 months, demonstrating the deleveraging power of our business. At this leverage level, we believe we have the near-term optionality to achieve an investment grade rating. However, for the time being, we are maintaining flexibility in order to comfortably assess all capital allocation options. Going forward, we expect to continue growing our dividend at a rate higher than the rate of growth of our AFFO over the next several years, while maintaining a low AFFO payout ratio. For the time being, excess future cash flows will likely be directed into the repayment of debt, as it is the most accretive short-term and is also beneficial long-term, but we will of course, also stay opportunistic around portfolio opportunities and additional stock buybacks. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024, and we have the capacity to satisfy that repayment entirely with cash flow from operations or availability under our revolver. We continue to have very good access to capital, and thus are comfortable to be opportunistic around the timing of future financings. Overall, we feel very good about our current capital position. As Brendan mentioned earlier, this represents my final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have participated in approximately 100 of these calls over the years. I have been honored to be the leader of this organization for the past 22 years and appreciative of the time I have spent with many of you on this call. Thank you for your support and goodwill throughout this very enjoyable ride. I will retire with the comfort and satisfaction of knowing SBA is a great company, in great shape, and with a management team that I know will lead it to new heights. I want to conclude by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we're ready for questions. I would say over my 25, 26 years, Jon, there's been a steady connection between growth in wireless demand and necessary infrastructure. And I think that really has its roots in the laws of physics and the way radio spectrum works. We've seen cycles that have repeated themselves over time. The current cycle feels like it's going to be a bit more elongated than perhaps some of the prior cycles, as I think our customers are demonstrating. Not that they didn't demonstrate fiscal prudence over the years, but it seems to be a particularly higher priority than racing to deploy spectrum, which they will own, and deploy it when they need it. But the basics haven't really changed that much. We haven't seen any technology that really will obsolete the basic tower business model. We watch satellites and things like that, and we watch small cells. And the macro site really continues to be the backbone of wireless communications. And the conversations we have with our customers tell us that they expect macro sites to continue to be the backbone. So I think there's always ups and downs and twists and turns, but directionally it remains pretty much the way it was many years ago. Well, thank you, Ric. We had a good run together. Yes. I think, Rick, the reason we haven't broken out total AFFO versus just AFFO from requalifying income that dividend is calculated, is we're not close to any of those levels. I mean, I think our philosophy will never change, which is we're only going to pay out what we have to on that calculation. And it also kind of confuses people if we introduced another metric. It's just, I think, easier for people to understand and think about when we're using AFFO. But we have a long way to go before we get to the point where we've exhausted our NOLs. And that gives us the ability to increase dividends faster than perhaps others. But at the same time, we're watching the total payout as a percentage of AFFO. And we're going to be able to do both, keep a lower relative payout ratio and increase the dividend at a faster pace for the next several years. Thanks, Ric. Yes. I think the FCC spectrum authority issue has to be resolved here soon. At the same time, the FCC has lost their spectrum authority. The White House and other governmental agencies are trying to plot and figure out long-term spectrum availability. So \u2013 and everybody knows it needs to get done, and it will. And I believe, by the time it has been done or will be done, Simon, the dual-band 3.45 and C-band equipment will be ready to go. So that's absolutely something that we think will contribute to next year's leasing. But there's a lot of spectrum still, and we think about things as a percentage of completion or deployment of certain spectrum bands on our towers. There's just a lot left to go. And I think it just shows that our customers are being fiscally prudent and waiting and looking for the right return results before they deploy. But ultimately, they have to deploy, unless the connection between growth in wireless data and the need for physical infrastructure has somehow changed, and that hasn't changed since the beginning of wireless. I'll let Brendan handle your M&A question. Thanks Mike. Thanks Nick. I do believe that there's a lot of spectrum out there, which is why now all of the three largest carriers have now all, or either have, or are beginning to deploy fixed wireless. Don't know that, that technology's been available in the last generation, it would have worked out. I mean, just on that point, from some things that I've read, the fixed wireless subscriber takes up 20 times to 30 times the wireless \u2013 the spectrum capacity. So I mean, it's statistics like that, Nick, that give us great confidence that over time, the connection that's existed forever, at least as long as I've been around, the connection between wireless data growth and the need for additional physical infrastructure is going to continue. But yes, I mean there's a lot of spectrum out there now, but it's rapidly getting used up. And it's going to continue to rapidly get used up the more success that the customers have with fixed wireless. Yes. I think said differently, if we continue to operate the way we have the last couple of quarters, we naturally will have the optionality of being an investment-grade issuer. That really, for us, is not so much more a matter of material leverage reduction as it is commitments and policy changes and things like that. We would, of course, before we materially increase leverage for allocation of capital, we would think long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do in advance of 2025. But it kind of is on a path. And Eric, we think, as we look around the world, look at portfolio pricing and things like that, it's very likely that we end 2024 at a lower leverage level, or certainly not a higher leverage level, than where we end 2023. Well, I usually sign off. But I'm going to let Brendan sign off. It's been an honor and a privilege. And I'm not able to say, as I have in my last 100, that we \u2013 that I look forward to talking to you next quarter. But you're in good hands."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another very solid quarter in Q3, with financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share, notwithstanding weaker forecasted foreign currency exchange rates than we had previously expected. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $637.5 million and cash site leasing revenues were $630.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a headwind of approximately $1.4 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, and a benefit of $4.8 million when compared to the third quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the third quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.8%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8.6% on a gross basis, and 4.7% on a net basis, including 3.9% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was up materially from the second quarter, primarily as a result of the AT&T master lease agreement signed in July. Excluding the impact of the AT&T MLA, third quarter activity levels were similar to the second quarter. All major carriers remain active with their networks. However, agreement execution levels continue to be slower than a year ago. The higher cost of capital naturally has caused a focus on cash management and expense control by our customers. This dynamic extends the timing over which 5G-related network investments are being made. There is still a long way to go for 5G network investments based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. Wireless data use continues to grow materially, and that fact, combined with the limited spectrum availability will require additional infrastructure over time to maintain and certainly to enhance service quality. This gives us great confidence in continued domestic organic leasing growth for many years to come. During the third quarter, domestic churn was slightly below our prior projections due to a slower pace of decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected. Our overall expectations for Sprint related churn remain the same, but there will likely continue to be small variations in timing of realizing this churn over the next several years. We currently expect Sprint related churn for 2023 to be $28 million. 2024 Sprint related churn is currently estimated to be approximately $30 million. Non-Sprint related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections and continues to range between 1% and 2% of our domestic leasing revenue. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, third quarter same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.5% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.4% on a gross basis. International leasing activity remained strong in the third quarter and was again ahead of our internal expectations. While global macroeconomic conditions present challenges to our carrier customers, we have continued to see pockets of dedicated network investment across a number of our markets. The desire and need for enhanced wireless coverage and quality of service continues to be elevated internationally, and we expect will continue to drive leasing opportunities across our portfolio. Wireless data growth in our international markets is even greater than the U.S. We also continue to see steady contributions from inflation-based escalators in many of our markets. In Brazil, our largest international market, the same-tower organic growth rate was 2.6% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 6.3% of churn, which growth rate reflects a decline in the Brazilian inflationary index. The net growth rate was also again significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than that associated with the TIM agreement. However, we continue to discuss potential arrangements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that could have an impact on our current year international churn. During the third quarter, 77.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $511.7 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.3%, and an international tower cash flow margin of 70%, or 91.5% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $482.1 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.4% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter. During the third quarter, our services business had another solid quarter, with $45.1 million in revenue, and $13.6 million of segment operating profit. While off last year's all-time high activity levels, we continued to execute on our backlog of high quality, high margin work and deliver for our carrier customers. However, given the slower pace of carrier network related activity across the industry, we have lowered our full year outlook for our site development business by $15 million at the midpoint. Notwithstanding this adjustment, we continue to manage our costs and focus on high-margin work. And thus, we have not lowered our expected margin contributions to 2023 adjusted EBITDA and AFFO from our services business. We still expect 2023 to be the second largest services revenue year in our history, trailing only 2022. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the third quarter was $364.1 million. AFFO per share was $3.34, an increase of 7.7% over the third quarter of 2022. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 45 communication sites for total cash consideration of $40.8 million, and building 86 new sites. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 215 sites, all of which are in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $74 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of 2024. In addition to new towers, we also continued to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. Before I turn things over to Mark, I'd like to take a quick moment to welcome Marc Montagner, who joined our team in mid-October, and will be taking over as our new CFO on January 1. Marc brings with him an extensive background in telecommunications and finance, and we are very excited to have him as part of the team. I also would be remiss if I did not take a moment to recognize that this call is Jeff's final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have big shoes to fill, and I am grateful for the professional guidance and the friendship he has extended to me over the last 25 years. And with that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet. Yes. I think, Jon, we'll see in the early part of heading into next year that things will probably be lower than they've been. But I would expect to see that increase over time. And it really base that answer mostly on the needs that our customers have. There's still quite a bit of spectrum that has to be deployed on our sites. There are some deadlines out there for certain of our customers that they need to meet. And just based on conversations that we have with them, suggest that there's still a ton of work to be done. But I think, as Jeff kind of alluded to, in the current moment in time, there's a little bit more of a focus on financial constraints and cost control. But I think that naturally will start to give way to network needs as mobile and wireless data consumption increases. So, I would expect that we'll see it start to move up as we get into the middle of next year. Yes. We're fortunate to be in the position that we're in, where we actually still have fairly sizable NOLs, which gives us some flexibility there, Ric. But as \u2013 you kind of look at it as, you produce a certain amount of taxable income, and we satisfy it through a mix of using NOLs and paying out dividends and in order to maintain our REIT compliance. And so by starting when we did, it has allowed us to continue to grow our dividend at a pace that I think is fairly high across most REITs, and will allow us to continue to do that to some degree, it's certainly at a pace greater than the AFFO per share growth. Until we reach a point at which we will have exhausted those NOLs, and at that point, I would expect we'll pay a dividend that is \u2013 whatever is necessary to comply with our REIT requirements. So that's kind of the way we look at it. What that means, based on our projections is that we'll continue to have nice growth in our dividend over the coming years. And we'll be able to keep our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO fairly low, which gives us a lot of flexibility on other discretionary uses for that capital. Yes. So as you alluded to, obviously, the broader environment, in terms of rates and cost of capital, is certainly influencing the trajectory of our leverage levels lately. And really, it's a combination of a couple of things. It's the overall cost, but it's also the relationship to the opportunities in front of us in terms of investing capital and what we see as the potential return on those items. And we haven't seen an appropriate adjustment, I guess, in the price points for some of that investment relative to the shift in the cost of capital. And so as a result, the best use of the cost of capital, most of the time, is to pay off some of our debt. And as you know, we had balances outstanding on our revolver. And so it's easy for us to just pay that down as the use of capital, and given that it's floating rate, it's some of our highest cost debt. So we will continue to do that. But at the same time, we're going to look to be opportunistic around opportunities to invest that capital, and the stock buybacks are representative of that. We started to see our stock trading down to levels where we just felt that it was an appropriate time to jump in, and it would be certainly accretive to us. Both in the short term and over the long term, we would expect to invest a little bit of capital into the buyback. So I think, as we think forward, longer term, we haven't necessarily targeted being investment grade, but the leverage has continued to drop. And that's one of the great things about this business, you continue to grow EBITDA, and it naturally \u2013 as we produce a lot of free cash flow, you naturally start to delever quickly. And so we're approaching those levels now where we certainly could move towards investment grade. But as we mentioned in our scripted comments, we are going to maintain that flexibility for the time being and see how things go. And if we decide that, that's a better way to go in terms of improving our cost of capital, then we have that optionality to do it. And if not, and there's other places to invest that we think are going to produce greater returns for our shareholders, we'll go that direction. Yes. I think last quarter, we gave you a range that was around $20 million to $30 million. And so by saying $30 million now, we're seeing it a little bit lower here as we end this year. But the total is still the same. When we originally were giving guidance, we expected to see a little bit more in 2025 and 2026. And now we're thinking 2025 is probably a little bit lower. So again, the total number is going to be basically the same, Ric. It's just trying to pinpoint exactly the timing from year-to-year is \u2013 it's been a little bit challenging to do with that kind of precision. But I think we've been pretty close. Yes. So on the M&A environment, we continue to see a very competitive environment. Notwithstanding where public valuations have gone, private valuations continue to remain elevated. And to the comments that I made earlier, that's obviously influence where we've directed some of our capital. So in the U.S., in particular, pricing is staying high. And even internationally, we're seeing that to some degree. Although I would say, internationally, there's perhaps been less in the market. There's still a ton out there of potential supply, but I think that sellers are being a little more cautious in their timing of bringing things to market. Yes. The leasing growth, I wouldn't say that it's really all that different than what we thought three months ago when we talked about it. It's perhaps slower than what we thought at the beginning of the year than we were originally thinking how this year would play out. But what we described last quarter, it's staying pretty much in line with that expectation that we laid out. And you could see that even in the guidance that we gave, where we didn't make any changes there. On the AT&T MLA and it's the potential for that with others. We have master agreements in place with other carriers. The form of those agreements can vary among the carriers, but it's really dependent upon the needs of that specific customer, and what works best for them and for us and creates the best win-win situation given what they're trying to accomplish in that particular negotiation. So I would say that we are certainly open to agreements with others over time as they're needed, and we have those conversations all the time. Exactly how they're structured may very well vary though, depending on the carriers' needs. Using the 5G-related spectrum it's approximately 50%. Yes. I don't know if it's necessarily structure. I would agree with your reference to scale, that in markets where we have scale, we've seen the benefits of that in our relationships with the carrier customers in those markets, and our ability to be more impactful in their projects for build-outs that they have. So scale is something that we're definitely paying attention to within these markets. And then in terms of other things that we might add, in some of these places, there are opportunities to provide incremental services that are somehow related or associated with what we currently do that add sort of an extra level of value that we're able to provide. It generates additional revenue streams that but it also kind of strengthens that relationship for a longer period of time. So we're exploring that. We're doing some things around C-RAN hubs, some things around power, some things around security in certain of our markets and we'll continue to explore those opportunities. No, there's not a specific target. I think, excluding Sprint churn, I would expect that we'll be able to produce mid-single digits growth rate in the U.S. But at this point, we're not comfortable to lay out a long-term target. And some of that, Mike, just to be clear, it's \u2013 there are a lot of factors that really aren't about wireless needs. If it was just about what do our customers need to do in terms of their network deployments, we perhaps would be able to do that a little bit more comfortably. I think some of these factors around cost of capital and other things that may affect timing of when our customers are spending influence that. So that just leads us to be a little bit more cautious in kind of naming specific targets. Yes. I don't \u2013 I think, Nick, it does speak to the higher-margin type work that we're doing. I'm not sure that it's sustainable at that same level that we are experiencing right at the moment. Some of that is really tied to an estimate of costs as we put these jobs on the books, and we're ending up actually finding ways to operate more efficiently and come in at lower cost levels. And then as you kind of true-up [ph] those jobs, since they're accounted for on a percentage of completion basis that helps. But I think, it just is evidence of our intent to focus on high-quality, high-margin work, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't know that 30% margins are the story for the long-term. Yes. Well, first of all, I think that we have tremendous access to capital. So from a refinancing perspective, I'm not concerned about that. We're actively evaluating all of our options there. And I'm confident that there are numerous markets available to us. Obviously, the costs are higher than they've been in the past. But in terms of access to capital, so that \u2013 that part of it doesn't concern me. I think, when we think about allocation of capital, though, it really is just a matter of what is the best return on investment, what is going to create the most shareholder value. So that sounds simplistic. But ultimately, that's what we're looking at. And so if we can use our capital, and maybe our leverage goes a little bit higher, which it's been in the past, certainly, because we see opportunities to invest that capital into either buybacks or new assets, we'll do that. We'd like to do that. But recently, we found that paying down debt has been the better way to go. And at some point, we'll be at a level where it's just going to be a natural shift. If that doesn't change, will be the natural shift to investment grade. And then it's just a matter of finding the right instruments that fit our capital structure to allow us to retain flexibility, but also get the best cost possible. Yes. I do think, Eric, there's definitely opportunities to bring it lower. For one, a big chunk of that is due to kind of smaller customers that frankly, as you start to have less and less of them or they are less of a percentage of our business, obviously, there's less opportunity or supply for that churn. And then with our agreements with some of our bigger customers, I would expect that any churn that's come from them will be significantly reduced as well. Yes. The above expectations comment was specifically associated with new leasing revenue signed up through new leases and amendments. And that was \u2013 we kind of obviously target based on backlog, and what our market intelligence is telling us what we think those numbers are going to look like in each market. And on average, across our international business, we were successful in signing up more new business than \u2013 from a dollar standpoint than we originally expected. So that's that comment. And I think it's driven really just by the significant needs that certain of our customers have across our markets for all the basic things that we talked about before, continued expansion of both 4G and even a little bit of 5G coverage. The coverage that exists in these markets is not nearly where it is in the U.S., so there's much greater needs in some cases. And so we're seeing that play out in a number of our markets. The escalator piece is not really a part of that. That varies and just moves based on where inflation is, and in certain of our markets, inflation was \u2013 has been a little bit higher. So that's helped the growth rates stay elevated. Yes. I think there's \u2013 most of that is being done internationally, first of all. I'm sure you see that in our release. And that will probably continue to be the case. There's definitely opportunities for new builds, for the same reasons as I just mentioned. In responding to the previous question, there's just a lot of coverage needs that exist in these markets. The real question for us is just making sure that we're doing \u2013 we're making worthwhile investments, given the cost of capital that's increased, that we're building sites, that we're confident are going to make a nice return, and that usually requires the addition of a second tenant at some point over the next several years after you build the site. So we're pretty diligent in kind of watching those sites. I think opportunities exist. But we're going to be selective about where we build sites. Yes. I think you've got a lot of different parties out there that have demands or their \u2013 their mission is to invest in digital infrastructure. And they have capital that's already been raised that needs to get deployed. And so I think that has \u2013 that plays a role in it. The supply, frankly, in the U.S. is somewhat limited, so there's still some competitive tension that exists there among many different parties that are investing. So that's really a driver. And so if you've got different return expectations, and you've got different views on what the growth profile of assets look like, you may be able to make a decision that's different than we're seeing the public companies, including SBA, make. Yes. I mean it depends on what market you're in. If you're talking about the ABS market, which has been our primary source of secured financing today, you'd be somewhere in the mid- to high 6s, would likely be where we play out. Yes, Brandon, we've \u2013 our backlogs are a little bit lower than they've been in the past. That \u2013 it probably shouldn't be a surprise, given the carriers' investment levels have been little bit slower as we've talked about. And obviously, executions have been down. The backlogs have trended in the same general direction. But it will be interesting to see how that plays out as we get into next year, as the carriers have new budgets in place and so forth. So for now, though, it's definitely trended down. Well, thank you all for joining us. We appreciate it. And thank you, Jeff, again, for all of your years. Appreciate it. Thanks, everyone."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 31. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another steady quarter in Q2 with solid financial results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter or $626.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $618.7 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $1.9 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $4.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.3% net over the second quarter of 2022 and including the impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.2%. The Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.8% on a gross basis and 4.2% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter declined from the first quarter. While all major carriers remained active with their networks, agreement execution levels in the second quarter from several of our customers were below our prior expectations. Longer term, we continue to see significant runway for new 5G-related leasing activity based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. In addition, today, we announced that we have entered into a new long-term master lease agreement with AT&T. This comprehensive agreement will streamline AT&T's deployment of 5G solutions across our tower portfolio while providing us with committed future leasing growth from AT&T for years to come. Based on this MLA, we have increased our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from domestic organic new leases and amendments by $6 million from the full year projections we provided last quarter. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 42% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 58%. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 89% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was slightly elevated during the quarter, primarily due to faster decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected which is the opposite of our experience last year. Based on our current analysis, we expect Sprint related churn for 2023 will be at the high end of our previously stated range for this year of $25 million to $30 million, resulting in a change to our full year domestic churn outlook of $4 million. Our views around the ultimate multiyear cumulative impact of Sprint merger-related churn have not changed. Although we continue to update our outlook around timing as more information becomes available. We now project 2024 Sprint related churn to be in a range of $20 million to $30 million, 2025 to be between $35 million and $45 million. 2026 to be $45 million to $55 million and 2027 to be $10 million to $20 million. Just as last year ended up being well below our initial churn expectations and 2023 will likely be a little above our initial expectations, we anticipate that the exact timing will continue to be somewhat fluid but in line with our provided projections. Non-Sprint-related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections. Moving now to international results. On a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.8% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was strong in the second quarter and ahead of our internal expectations. These positive results and our solid backlogs have allowed us to increase our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from international organic new leases and amendments by $1 million. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make steady contributions to our organic growth. However, decreases in actual and projected Brazilian CPI rates have caused us to moderate our outlook for international escalation contributions for the full year by approximately $1 million. Overall, Brazil, our largest international market, had another very good quarter. The same tower organic growth rate in Brazil was 5.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.6% of churn which amount was significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. While international churn remains elevated, it continues to be in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the OI consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the oil consolidation that would be expected to have an impact on our current year we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the second quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 13.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $503.5 million, Tower cash flow in the quarter benefited by approximately $7.3 million in accounting-driven cost reclassifications. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.5% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.3% or 92.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $471.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $52.4 million in revenue and $13.1 million of segment operating profit. While off year ago activity levels, our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter and we have retained our full year outlook for our site development business due in part to the strength of our first half results. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $352.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.24, an increase of 6.2% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 9 communication sites for total cash consideration of $7.2 million and building 64 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 134 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $72.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites and during the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $10.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6x. And below the low end of our target range and the lowest level in decades. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a strong 4.9x. During a subsequent to quarter end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have $360 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.5 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance was 6.3%. The interest rate of 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock, choosing instead to reduce revolver balances. We currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2023, were $108.4 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on September 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend we paid in the year ago period. and only 26% of our projected full year AFFO. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid one for SBA. We produced good financial results across all areas of our business and we continue to deliver high-quality service and operating results for our customers. Each of our largest U.S. customers remained active with their networks. Our customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. We did, however, see the same slowdown in activity that many others have discussed. While we had always anticipated domestic leasing growth to moderate as we move through 2023 and organic leasing activity levels were lower than we anticipated in Q2 from some of our customers. Some of this was due, we believe, to slower activity from AT&T in anticipation of our new MLA as would be expected. We believe that these variations in activity are part of the normal cycle of carrier network investment that we have seen over time, a large initial burst of coverage activity as the next generation of technology starts to be deployed, followed by many years of coverage completion and capacity building. We are confident that there will be additional material network investment over the next several years. We believe this for a number of reasons. Most importantly, wireless demand continues to grow at a fast clip, consuming more and more of current network capacity. We have a large remaining number of sites that have not been upgraded yet to accommodate the mid-band spectrum holdings acquired by our customers over the last couple of years, some of which spectrum is not even available for deployment yet. DISH has their next phase of regulatory coverage requirements to meet in 2025 and we have our newly signed MLA with AT&T. We believe all of these items and others are supportive of multiyear continued development activity. While there will always be ebbs and flows in leasing activity levels based on a variety of factors, we believe that there will remain a need for continuous network investment just as we have seen throughout our history in this business. With regard to our announced master lease agreement with AT&T, we're very excited about this next chapter in our long-standing successful relationship. This new agreement highlights the long-term importance of SBA sites to AT&T's future network deployment plans. The agreement will improve operating efficiencies between our organizations and enhance stability with regard to future leasing growth. We look forward to working closely with AT&T for years to come under this mutually beneficial framework. In the second quarter, our services business remained busy helping our carrier customers meet deployment objectives in an efficient and effective manner. While our services business is down on a year-over-year basis, 2023 will still represent the second biggest service this year in our company's history behind only 2022. We believe our legacy and reputation in the Services business keeps us well positioned to be a go-to provider for our customers to meet their network rollout goals. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. During the quarter, 62% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 38% came through new leases with strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market. I continue to be pleased with our operational performance, cost management and customer relationships in Brazil which has made us a leader in the market. And we have recently seen positive movements in the currency exchange rate, providing some financial benefit and increased U.S. dollars for repatriation as well as contributing to our increased full year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil. During the quarter, we again generated solid AFFO providing significant cash for discretionary allocation. While our strong financial position allows us to retain flexibility for future further opportunistic investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and we dedicated the majority of our available cash in the quarter to paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefit from this by reducing our floating rate cash interest obligations which today represent among the highest cost debt in our capital structure. With the continuing high cost and limited availability of private market tower acquisition opportunities, we believe this is currently our best use of discretionary spending. Our quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6% which I believe to be the lowest in our history, at least as a public company. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic around investments but for the near term, likely direct future cash flows into the repayment of debt as the most accretive short term and certainly a long-term beneficial use of capital. Our balance sheet is in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024. And since that maturity could easily be refinanced under our revolver, we are comfortable now to remain opportunistic around timing of future financings. We are a preferred issuer in the debt markets we routinely use and retain very good access to capital. We finished the quarter with 95% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed for now to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we continue paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year. We feel very good about our current capital position. We feel fortunate to be in a sound, stable business with tremendous fundamentals and significant long-term opportunity ahead. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we will be there to support them in meeting those needs. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we will hear from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRic Prentiss: Good afternoon, everybody. Obviously, I have some questions on the AT&T MLA, big news item there. I appreciate, I think, Randy, you said $6 million of the increase lease activity was really driven by AT&T MLA it [ph].\nJeff Stoops: Rick, can you speak up? We're having trouble hearing you right?\nRic Prentiss: Can you hear me better now?\nJeff Stoops: That's much better. Thank you.\nRic Prentiss: You bet. Yes, I'm sorry about that. I had another phone call come in. It's like doing something busy. Yes, I appreciate some of the color on the MLA with AT&T A couple of questions around it. Why now? And any others that you're working on? And then also suggesting that $6 million increase in guidance came from that it looks like we should be thinking maybe of kind of flattish new lease activity over the next couple of quarters. And as we exit '23, is that the way we should be thinking about it.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the MLA, first of all, on the numbers, the $6 million increase is basically due to the MLA. Obviously, that was our -- the 72% [ph] is what we reported last time, we increased to 78% and activity was a little bit slower in the second quarter. So we expect that the MLA will kick in right away based on the terms of it and will be a contributor going forward. In terms of the cadence would be fairly flat. I would expect actually that we'll see an uptick in terms of the contribution to the third quarter as a result of the and then you'll see it be a little bit lower into the fourth quarter. And that lower trajectory has nothing to do with the MLA. That's really based on slowing activity from other carriers. If you recall correctly, we had kind of a trajectory expected that was downward leaning throughout the year and I would expect that will continue as it relates to other contributors. In terms of why, Rick, this agreement with AT&T has been in the works for well over a year. And it's a deal that we believe is beneficial to both organizations. We've been working on it for that period of time and trying to signal and be transparent to our openness for this type of agreement knowing that we were likely to enter into this agreement which we have. We really don't want to comment too much on what's going on with other customers. But just as we have always said, we are not hung up so much on structure as we are on finding mutually beneficial agreements with our customers.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And one other one for me on the -- paying down the revolver. When does the calculus move back towards stock buyback? Because it sounds like there's still not a lot of M&A out there which would be probably your first choice. But how do we think about when the lever moves since you're down to 6.6 leverage to more stock buyback? Is that like a next year item? Is that further out?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think if rates stay the same and stock prices stay the same, it's -- it will continue to be more accretive. And obviously, good for the overall capital position to continue to pay down the revolver to 0. So when we get to that point, Rick, we should you could ask that question again.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Just curious, just a follow-up on the comprehensive deal with AT&T. Can you share some of the multiyear components of this deal, is there going to be a straight-line element that sometimes comes up with these types of multiyear or comprehensive opportunities? And does it change the way investors should think about leasing overall for SBA in 2024 in the domestic side?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Mike. So it will certainly smooth the way that we operate with AT&T. So I think from that perspective, perhaps it impacts our reported growth numbers in terms of ebbs and flows. There may be a little bit less of that, at least as it relates to this particular agreement. From a straight-line impact, we would expect that over the course of the agreement that we will have some straight-line impacts but there are no straight line -- or very minimal straight-line impacts in the short term.\nMichael Rollins: And just on the commentary on leasing. So the site development revenues are unchanged from the prior guidance. But you did note that there was some slower activity levels. Was this just something that you were maybe more prepared for earlier in the year? Or is there anything different about your development business that maybe gave your expectation a little more durability in spite of some of the changes that you observed?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think we know our site development business very well. You know it primarily centers around work almost entirely work on our towers. So we have a very good feel for it. And there's just enough work out there Mike, that was already booked earlier in the year and actually some of it probably spilling over from last year, that's now working itself through our services backlog that gives us the comfort to continue with the guidance that we have. So a lot of it is more a reflection of activity levels that occurred Q1, Q4 of last year.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. I was just wondering on the leverage point, have you had any more consideration of targeting investment-grade status? Or is that -- is this going to be just a temporary that change in your overall leverage targets. And then you could just talk on [ph].\nJeff Stoops: Yes. Right now, I think you should assume it's temporary so that we can continue to watch interest rates and see where they go. If interest rates stay high, it may not be temporary. We haven't made that decision yet. Actually, we're paying down the revolver because it's the most economic and best use of our cash today. It just so happens that as we continue to do that, we further decrease leverage which makes the path of going to investment grade. If we were to so choose that path easier to obtain. But I really don't think you should look at it, Simon, as a conscious effort to get to investment grade as much as it is just the best financial use of our discretionary cash.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Yes. And just one follow-up. You mentioned earlier that you still got a lot of sites that have not been upgraded to 5G. Do you think as given some of the rural SKU of your portfolio, do you think that would advantage to your portfolio in the next several years versus to that initial build out?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I think if history is any guide, I guess, that's exactly how it works. It starts out in the NFL cities, it goes from there.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: Two, if I can. How should we think about the exit run rate in activity this year versus going into next year? AT&T, it sounds like is steady in 3Q and 4Q and then from there and others are decelerating through this year. Should we think of the fourth quarter as a decent run rate for next year or maybe a little bit lower than that? And then second, Jeff, I didn't understand your comment just a second ago on the service revenue now for activity earlier in the year. And it sounds like services are still running well ahead of historical levels. Do you expect them to come in -- it sounds like you expect them -- you're going to make the guide this year but next year, it sounds like things are going to be probably well below. Does that make sense?\nJeff Stoops: Go ahead, Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So on the first question, we do -- we expect that the fourth quarter run rate, you're talking specifically, just to be clear about domestic organic leasing contribution to be around approximately $17 million to $17.5 million. But I would definitely caution you as to using that as an indicator of next year. As I mentioned earlier, the trajectory based on activity levels is declining. And as a result, we would expect those numbers to step down as we move into next year. We're obviously not ready to give 2024 guidance yet at this point. but just kind of broadly when you think about it, the way we've always explained it and just the way that it actually happens is that you get a lot of growth, for instance, the 2023 growth is based heavily on the leasing activity that took place at the end of last year, 2022. And next year's numbers will be based heavily on the leasing activity that's taking place this year. So the number is a little bit higher than we said before because of the impacts of the MLA for the fourth quarter but I don't believe we'll be indicative of the numbers for next year.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And as far as the services revenue, Phil, the first half of what we report in 2024 will be largely dictated by what we do now operationally with leasing. We have 2 different components of that. We have the site acquisition component which is the planning stuff and then we have the construction which is where a lot of the current activity is taking place because that's the last part of the cycle. So we'll see. We'll see where we come out with the guidance on services but it will be obviously heavily impacted by how we finish out the rest of the year.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.\nJonathan Atkin: So I was interested in doing just to contextualize the AT&T MLA, how much of your revenues for kind of this year next year, the following year, can we be considered to be fairly locked in as opposed to usage based -- segmental revenue.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, you mean just the percentage of the AT&T revenue or overall revenue?\nJonathan Atkin: Overall revenue base for the whole company, how do we kind of think about how much is kind of a lock versus more the.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Right. John, we can't give specific numbers out. And obviously, a number of our agreements with other customers are fluid and where those amounts end up or obviously unknown. So as a percentage, it's hard to say as well. So we can't be very specific about it but we do have some portion of our revenue base that is locked in now under this agreement that wasn't before.\nJeff Stoops: And a greater portion of the AT&T then probably exists under other agreements, although we still have some of that. And I mean I don't think that's not a number that we have focused on that. So the best we can answer, Jonathan, is that it's a much greater extent under the AT&T revenue.\nJonathan Atkin: Then and you're comparing that to your agreements with other carriers as opposed to other towercos agreements with AT&T, I'm assuming?\nJeff Stoops: Correct. Yes. correct.\nJonathan Atkin: Got it. Yes, understood. And then maybe just give us some directional guidance around the trajectory around building new towers and ground lease and Eastman's activity.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean we continue to look for good financially smart new build opportunities. We're doing those mostly outside the United States primarily Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest markets outside the United States. And we have a steady focus on ground lease purchases and extensions which hasn't changed at all. It's moved a little bit more international in terms of the mix just because we've been at it so long in the United States. But nothing's really changed there. We would put more capital into particularly the land purchases and extensions if the opportunities arose.\nJonathan Atkin: And then in terms of purchasing other portfolios, maybe you're thinking about Africa and your operating history there and maybe some tuck-in opportunities, either that geography or elsewhere -- what are your thoughts on increasing your scale in existing markets versus expanding the footprint?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean, the answer to that question is pretty much the same as it has been for years for the right deal, we will do it. We have no strategic hole that we feel needs to be filled. In market growth because of the existing base is going to be preferred over new market growth but we would still go into a new market. If we found the right deal and I would point back to the Tanzania investment as a good example of that. But because it's all financially driven, it makes our decision to use discretionary cash to pay down the revolver that much more straightforward.\nJonathan Atkin: Lastly, I might have missed this but the duration of the AT&T MLA?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It's 5 years, Jonathan.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: So I guess maybe 2. The first one, Jeff, just with respect to some of the actions that your competitors are taking frozen cons for being in the construction business for towers at all? Is there maybe an opportunity to redirect resources in more optimal ways? Or is there an opportunity if people are willing to give up business for you guys to lean in at the margin as we think about the go ahead business? And then second, maybe for Mark, as we think about the 25 term loan and its maturity what should the Street be doing in terms of expectations in the model with respect to how we address that cost fixed, long-term roll it? What is the plan?\nJeff Stoops: Dave, I'm going to defer that to our expert here, Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: On the services question, David, we've had a lot of history. Actually, you recall, that's how SBA started. So we have a very flexible cost structure that allows us to ramp up, ramp down we use a lot of subcontracted tower crews. We have our own but we also use subcontracted tower crews. And 1 of the things that has really served us well and our customers give us high praise for this is by using our services people for work on our towers for them, they are greatly benefited in terms of speed to market and efficiencies. So I don't think that changes. So I guess if I had to choose 1 of your 2 options lean out or lean in, we'll look to lean in and not be afraid to do that because of our confidence in how we manage that business.\nMark DeRussy: And Dave, on the term loan, your question of modeling, if I can only say into the future enough but we, yes. I mean, the best thing, I think, for people to do when looking at it is probably to assume a similar like-for-like refinancing. And I would expect that spreads will be similar to up slightly from where they are today but we'll have to see how that plays out. And then it's just a matter of using the forward curve in terms of the benchmark, SOFA rate. But that doesn't mean that that's necessarily how it will play out. We will probably have -- we will be evaluating multiple different options. There may be a mix of different instruments that we use. Some may be fixed and some may be floating but all things are on the table for us right now and we look at that, frankly, every day. But if you're just simply modeling out long term, I think the best thing to do is to assume a like-for-like instrument.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk: All right. Perfect. Sorry. The -- if you didn't have the AT&T MLA, would the 72 still stick? Or would that fall off accelerating faster than you thought in terms of the second half of the year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I can't really answer that question, Walt, because there's so many elements that go into it. what would the activity be with AT&T, otherwise, those types of things. So I can't really say for sure what it would be, given that we were working on this for quite a while. [Technical Difficulty] First, we don't like to discuss the individual customers but obviously, DISH has just gotten through a major deadline that they had. There's a little bit of a slowdown or pause, if you will, related to that. And we would expect that will eventually pick up. But given the delay between signings and revenue recognition, I would expect that will weigh year-over-year on next year. and T-Mobile was frankly very, very busy as well and you have somewhat of a similar dynamic there. But that's what we're going into for next year. But longer term, there's still a lot to do there. So we can...\nWalter Piecyk: So if there was something incremental like qualitatively? What do you think those issues are?\nBrendan Cavanagh: If there was something incremental in what sense?\nWalter Piecyk: You just -- in the response you just gave, meaning in Q2 was a little bit less and you're saying you're expecting that to continue into the third and fourth quarter because, again, I think you guys did a good job historically already talking about a slowdown in the second half of the year? And also maybe how that would carry into 2024. And I'm just trying to get a sense of is there something new or worse?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't think there's something particularly new. I think it's been a little bit slower than what we had anticipated before. But directionally, it's still the same. So what does that mean for next year? Does that mean $5 million difference or $10 million. I can't tell you yet. We're not ready to get there and we still have half the year to go. But it's marginally worse than what we thought in terms of the balance of the other carriers.\nJeff Stoops: The qualitative benefits or the positives to look forward to all I mean, DISH has to get started, whether it's late Q4 or early Q1 on their 2025 bill which is going to be large. T-Mobile hasn't even got the C-band and the 3.5 spectrum yet. You got the -- you got some folks waiting on availability of dual band equipment. So there's all kinds of things to look forward to as we move through the year and into next.\nWalter Piecyk: Are you seeing anything from cable, Jeff?\nJeff Stoops: Little bit but not enough to give anyone the impression it's going to move the needle.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Great. A quick follow-up on the AT&T lay. Does it cover all the towers that AT&T has equipment on your sites? And should we assume that the escalator in there is similar to the 3%, 3.5% that you have? And another one, I believe you said 42-58 mix for amendments and new leases. Can you give us a sense of how that will look like if we just exclude DISH?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question?\nBatya Levi: AT&T MLA, if it includes all the sites they have with you and the escalator.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Right. So it does -- there may be a few exceptions because of specific issues around individual sites but the vast majority of our sites are covered by the MLA.\nJeff Stoops: That have AT&T on.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, that have AT&T on of course. And then on the escalator piece, I can't really get into the specifics around what the escalator is but our historical escalator with AT&T has been north of 3% and we would expect that to continue.\nBatya Levi: Great. And the amendments without DASH, is that much higher than the 42%?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It would be. It would be if you took DISH out of the mix, you would have a much higher percentage of amendments of the total.\nBatya Levi: Okay. Maybe just a quick one. As you -- can you give us a sense on what the guidance assumes for DISH as we exit the year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No, we can't give you that kind of specificity now. Much less it was but it's much less than it was exiting last year.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.\nNick Del Deo: First, regarding the AT&T deal, should we think of that as pulling forward some revenue that you otherwise would have expected in the latter years into the near future? And do you feel that the totality of the revenue that you'll get from AT&T over the course of the contract is similar to what it otherwise would have been.\nJeff Stoops: The answer to the last part of your question is yes. The answer to the first part, I don't think it's a pull forward.\nBrendan Cavanagh: I mean it's hard to say because, obviously, previously, it would be very specific to the timing of when they were signing things. We don't know exactly what that timing would be. So could be pulling forward, could be pushing.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. The answer to your question will be only known in hindsight by the levels of AT&T's activity.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. So we should think of it more, call it, smoothing a bit but not necessarily sort of a mass reallocation of what the revenue would have been. Is that fair?\nJeff Stoops: Yes.\nNick Del Deo: Yes. Okay, great. And then, kind of two clarifications for Brendan. One, it looks like your forecast for other international revenue went up by about $9 million versus last quarter's guidance. What was that? And was it in this quarter's results? And then second, can you elaborate a bit on the $7 million in cost reclassifications that you noted in your prepared remarks -- what was it reclassified to and from? What was behind it which segment?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the other international was -- roughly half of that was in the second quarter. There is some that is in the balance of the year. And it's frankly a mix of things. It's not 1 thing in particular. There was some increased cash basis revenue recovery that we did not necessarily forecast and some that we've actually even seen subsequent to quarter end. And then also some termination fees. And just other frankly, cats and dogs, Nick but they did add up and we actually have higher expectations for the balance of the year. So that's that piece of it. On the accounting reclassification it basically has to do with the decommissioning of some carrier-related equipment, basically Sprint oriented equipment at some of our tower sites that we previously had expected or had been recording as a cost of revenue, a direct cost of revenue. But after discussion with our accountants, it was determined that the best classification for that was impairment and decommissioning costs. So basically, it's just a move of those costs out of cost of revenue and into impairment and decommission costs.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. So sort of a onetime true-up?\nBrendan Cavanagh: There was some onetime true-up in there but that's the way to also be going forward and that's assumed within the guidance that we've given around tower cash flow.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Can you share anything about how much of the change was attributable to that beyond the $7 million recognized in the quarter, what it would be for the full year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's another roughly $4 million.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Two questions, if you don't mind. When some of your peers announced their own versions of MLAs or holistic agreements or whatever they call it, it's not uncommon when they announce it for them, they come out and say, \"Oh, by the way, we're raising our guidance for straight-line revenue. I know you got a question about this earlier but it's typically because there's some incremental commitment that was made in that agreement, maybe use escalators or some other amount of leasing. And you didn't do that with this agreement. So I can imagine a question we're going to get is, ultimately, what do you feel like you accomplished through the MLA because you've been very selective and entering into these larger agreements? And I know there's been some questions on it but I'm trying to think about the right way of framing that. And then the second question is portfolio growth has been a focus for SBA for a very long time. I remember the analyst meeting, I don't know, 15-plus years ago when you first started talking about those long-term targets. And it's understandable why paying down your revolver right now is probably the economically most accretive thing to do. But whenever we get past this moment, do you think portfolio growth is going to be the same priority and same opportunity? Or are you starting to suspect that maybe the tower portfolios that you don't own in the markets you're in or might want to be and are not nearly as attractive as the types of portfolios you could just develop on your own, particularly outside the U.S.\nJeff Stoops: I will take the last one first. I believe portfolio growth will always be our most desirable and highest potential allocation of capital. where it falls today. I mean, keep in mind, we grew the portfolio 15% last year. Where it falls today is purely a function of cost of debt and availability and pricing of assets. But as long as all that works out, Brett, to achieve an investment result that we want, I don't see the preference and prioritization of portfolio growth changing.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And Brett, on the question around the straight line for the MLA, there actually was you couldn't see it but there is actually some small impact to straight line that was actually offset by a decrease in straight line associated with some of the accelerated Sprint churn that we mentioned earlier. So there is a small impact. But in terms of what it looks like going forward, obviously, what our peers have done and what we've done, they're probably not exactly the same agreements. I'm sure there are terms that are different. I can't speak to there specifically. But really, it's a function of timing in terms of when certain commitments take place. And in the future, I would expect that there will be some straight-line impact as a result of this deal but it's a little more activity driven than it is upfront.\nJeff Stoops: It will -- you will see straight-line benefits over time over the course of the 5 years, Brett, based on various triggers and activity levels as opposed to as opposed to upon signing.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Chaplin [ph] with New Street.\nUnidentified Analyst: One just very basic question. How do you assess that paying down the revolver is the most accretive use of free cash flow? How do you sort of put that up against the accretion you get from share repurchase? Is it as simple as what the yield of the debt is relative to your AFFO yield? And are you taking the direction of rates into consideration when you make that determination? Or is it just sort of a moment-by-moment decision that drives whether you're in the market buying back stock or paying down the revolver? And then just a follow-up question on DISH. Is there anything assumed in new leasing activity for the second half of this year from DISH in your guidance?\nBrendan Cavanagh: The accretion analysis takes into account a number of things. There's certainly the basic straightforward piece that you mentioned which is what's the yield of buying back our stock today versus what can we save by paying down the revolver or any debt. And right now, that actually is more accretive to pay down the revolver today. But we also look at it long term and we look at our expectations for growth. for growth and cash flow as well as what we think our future financing or refinancing costs will be and that positioning relative to our balance sheet as a whole is also relevant to it.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. And that bodes towards stock repurchases, Jonathan, with one major exception today which is we don't know that interest rates have stopped going up. And when interest rates go up, it immediately affects the cost on the revolver. We can always buy our stock back. And that -- we take comfort in that. But when you have an increasing interest rate environment where we don't know when it's over, we just think both from a business perspective and certainly a balance sheet perspective and from an accretion perspective, pay down the revolver balance while we have one as the way to go.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And DISH in terms of the impact for the second half of the year, as we mentioned, it's obviously been slower in terms of new business being signed up with them. There's still a significant contributor to the second half numbers because of all the business that they did with us over the last year. But we expect that we'll continue to see, at least for this year, less executions with them. But ultimately, they have a ton to do, as we talked about to meet their 25% goal and we would expect that, that will turn around sometime at the end of the year or into next year.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Just going back to the question on investment grade. I know that's clearly not part of the plan right now. But theoretically, if you did make that decision, what type of leverage do you think you'd have to target to get there? And how quickly do you think you could get there based on where your leverage is at today?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, based on the thresholds that are there by the agencies or at least by one of the agencies right now, we're getting very close to being there, certainly within a half turn of leverage of being there. but it would be more about the commitment to staying there than it would be about hitting the leverage tier.\nEric Luebchow: Yes. Understood. And then just another question on the comprehensive MLA. I mean does this it all indicates that you guys would still be open to entering into simpler arrangements with some of the other carriers to maybe smooth out some of the leasing volatility? Or is it really just a case-by-case basis what you think would be NPV positive for your business?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean it's really the latter. But I mean, we've always said we would be open to a variety of structures I mean this, I think, evidence is that openness. So for the right deal, Eric, we would do any number of structures with our customers.\nOperator: And next will hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: Belaboring the point, I have a few on the maybe just high level, given the MLA with Tim and now with AT&T, has the market changed? Have customers changed? Or has your perspective changed? And then maybe if you could give us any specifics along the number of sites, minimum payment schedule. You mentioned it was sort of 5 years but I'd imagine the leases are for much longer. Any details around that would be helpful.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think in terms of the details, we need to keep -- stay away from most of those. There's a lot of specific things that you asked about there that obviously are somewhat important for us to keep confidential for both us and our customers. But it is a 5-year agreement and there will be a lot of ramifications that I would expect would extend beyond the 5 years. In terms of the M&A in general, I think Jeff kind of answered this earlier. It's -- we've always been open to different structures, obviously, at different points in time in our history. We haven't necessarily found terms that we found to be beneficial to us or they didn't work for our customers, whatever the case may be. So we've done less of those. But we've done MLAs over the years in various structures, we have in MLA today with Verizon, we've had MLAs with T-Mobile and with DISH. So we've done these agreements before but each 1 is dependent upon the specifics around that carrier and their needs at the time and what works for both parties. So I don't know that anything has holistically changed out in the market broadly.\nJeff Stoops: Yes. I mean, we are trying to be responsive to our customers, while at the same time being responsible to ourselves and our shareholders. and that will continue to be kind of the big picture as to how we approach these things and it could lead to more or if this could be the only one.\nBrendan Lynch: Maybe just to clarify a point. I think you've described some of your past MLAs as being pricing menus. Is that how you would characterize this arrangement with AT&T or is there a better way to think about it?\nJeff Stoops: Yes. This would be a little different than that. This would be payments in exchange for AT&T having certain rights to use our towers.\nOperator: And now we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.\nGreg Williams: Just first question on any further developments with beyond Tim with the other carriers, any ongoing discussions are you having them? And are you hopeful you can get anything done by year-end? And then just second, on the site development, it sounds like it'll hang out in the low 50s for the next few quarters. Anything to think about in terms of service margins from here?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the oil question, you're talking specifically about deals with the other carriers that took over iWireless I believe yes, we are having conversations with those other carriers. And it's possible that there would be some other arrangements truck with them but it's premature for us to say. And obviously, if we do reach one, we'll let you know at that time. And then on the site development question, I would expect that the margins will stay pretty similar on a percentage basis to what you've seen during the first half of this year. The volume may be a hair lower but pretty flat. Your estimate of around 50 or so quarters is probably about right.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJeff Stoops: Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening and we look forward to getting back together in late October for our third quarter report. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid one for SBA. We produced good financial results across all areas of our business and we continue to deliver high-quality service and operating results for our customers. Each of our largest U.S. customers remained active with their networks. Our customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. We did, however, see the same slowdown in activity that many others have discussed. While we had always anticipated domestic leasing growth to moderate as we move through 2023 and organic leasing activity levels were lower than we anticipated in Q2 from some of our customers. Some of this was due, we believe, to slower activity from AT&T in anticipation of our new MLA as would be expected. We believe that these variations in activity are part of the normal cycle of carrier network investment that we have seen over time, a large initial burst of coverage activity as the next generation of technology starts to be deployed, followed by many years of coverage completion and capacity building. We are confident that there will be additional material network investment over the next several years. We believe this for a number of reasons. Most importantly, wireless demand continues to grow at a fast clip, consuming more and more of current network capacity. We have a large remaining number of sites that have not been upgraded yet to accommodate the mid-band spectrum holdings acquired by our customers over the last couple of years, some of which spectrum is not even available for deployment yet. DISH has their next phase of regulatory coverage requirements to meet in 2025 and we have our newly signed MLA with AT&T. We believe all of these items and others are supportive of multiyear continued development activity. While there will always be ebbs and flows in leasing activity levels based on a variety of factors, we believe that there will remain a need for continuous network investment just as we have seen throughout our history in this business. With regard to our announced master lease agreement with AT&T, we're very excited about this next chapter in our long-standing successful relationship. This new agreement highlights the long-term importance of SBA sites to AT&T's future network deployment plans. The agreement will improve operating efficiencies between our organizations and enhance stability with regard to future leasing growth. We look forward to working closely with AT&T for years to come under this mutually beneficial framework. In the second quarter, our services business remained busy helping our carrier customers meet deployment objectives in an efficient and effective manner. While our services business is down on a year-over-year basis, 2023 will still represent the second biggest service this year in our company's history behind only 2022. We believe our legacy and reputation in the Services business keeps us well positioned to be a go-to provider for our customers to meet their network rollout goals. Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. During the quarter, 62% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 38% came through new leases with strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market. I continue to be pleased with our operational performance, cost management and customer relationships in Brazil which has made us a leader in the market. And we have recently seen positive movements in the currency exchange rate, providing some financial benefit and increased U.S. dollars for repatriation as well as contributing to our increased full year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil. During the quarter, we again generated solid AFFO providing significant cash for discretionary allocation. While our strong financial position allows us to retain flexibility for future further opportunistic investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and we dedicated the majority of our available cash in the quarter to paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefit from this by reducing our floating rate cash interest obligations which today represent among the highest cost debt in our capital structure. With the continuing high cost and limited availability of private market tower acquisition opportunities, we believe this is currently our best use of discretionary spending. Our quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6% which I believe to be the lowest in our history, at least as a public company. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic around investments but for the near term, likely direct future cash flows into the repayment of debt as the most accretive short term and certainly a long-term beneficial use of capital. Our balance sheet is in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024. And since that maturity could easily be refinanced under our revolver, we are comfortable now to remain opportunistic around timing of future financings. We are a preferred issuer in the debt markets we routinely use and retain very good access to capital. We finished the quarter with 95% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed for now to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we continue paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year. We feel very good about our current capital position. We feel fortunate to be in a sound, stable business with tremendous fundamentals and significant long-term opportunity ahead. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we will be there to support them in meeting those needs. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions. Rick, can you speak up? We're having trouble hearing you right? That's much better. Thank you. Yes. I think if rates stay the same and stock prices stay the same, it's -- it will continue to be more accretive. And obviously, good for the overall capital position to continue to pay down the revolver to 0. So when we get to that point, Rick, we should you could ask that question again. Yes. I think we know our site development business very well. You know it primarily centers around work almost entirely work on our towers. So we have a very good feel for it. And there's just enough work out there Mike, that was already booked earlier in the year and actually some of it probably spilling over from last year, that's now working itself through our services backlog that gives us the comfort to continue with the guidance that we have. So a lot of it is more a reflection of activity levels that occurred Q1, Q4 of last year. Yes. Right now, I think you should assume it's temporary so that we can continue to watch interest rates and see where they go. If interest rates stay high, it may not be temporary. We haven't made that decision yet. Actually, we're paying down the revolver because it's the most economic and best use of our cash today. It just so happens that as we continue to do that, we further decrease leverage which makes the path of going to investment grade. If we were to so choose that path easier to obtain. But I really don't think you should look at it, Simon, as a conscious effort to get to investment grade as much as it is just the best financial use of our discretionary cash. Yes. I think if history is any guide, I guess, that's exactly how it works. It starts out in the NFL cities, it goes from there. Go ahead, Brendan. Yes. And as far as the services revenue, Phil, the first half of what we report in 2024 will be largely dictated by what we do now operationally with leasing. We have 2 different components of that. We have the site acquisition component which is the planning stuff and then we have the construction which is where a lot of the current activity is taking place because that's the last part of the cycle. So we'll see. We'll see where we come out with the guidance on services but it will be obviously heavily impacted by how we finish out the rest of the year. And a greater portion of the AT&T then probably exists under other agreements, although we still have some of that. And I mean I don't think that's not a number that we have focused on that. So the best we can answer, Jonathan, is that it's a much greater extent under the AT&T revenue. Correct. Yes. correct. Yes. I mean we continue to look for good financially smart new build opportunities. We're doing those mostly outside the United States primarily Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest markets outside the United States. And we have a steady focus on ground lease purchases and extensions which hasn't changed at all. It's moved a little bit more international in terms of the mix just because we've been at it so long in the United States. But nothing's really changed there. We would put more capital into particularly the land purchases and extensions if the opportunities arose. Yes. I mean, the answer to that question is pretty much the same as it has been for years for the right deal, we will do it. We have no strategic hole that we feel needs to be filled. In market growth because of the existing base is going to be preferred over new market growth but we would still go into a new market. If we found the right deal and I would point back to the Tanzania investment as a good example of that. But because it's all financially driven, it makes our decision to use discretionary cash to pay down the revolver that much more straightforward. Dave, I'm going to defer that to our expert here, Brendan. The qualitative benefits or the positives to look forward to all I mean, DISH has to get started, whether it's late Q4 or early Q1 on their 2025 bill which is going to be large. T-Mobile hasn't even got the C-band and the 3.5 spectrum yet. You got the -- you got some folks waiting on availability of dual band equipment. So there's all kinds of things to look forward to as we move through the year and into next. Little bit but not enough to give anyone the impression it's going to move the needle. That have AT&T on. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. The answer to the first part, I don't think it's a pull forward. Yes. The answer to your question will be only known in hindsight by the levels of AT&T's activity. Yes. I will take the last one first. I believe portfolio growth will always be our most desirable and highest potential allocation of capital. where it falls today. I mean, keep in mind, we grew the portfolio 15% last year. Where it falls today is purely a function of cost of debt and availability and pricing of assets. But as long as all that works out, Brett, to achieve an investment result that we want, I don't see the preference and prioritization of portfolio growth changing. It will -- you will see straight-line benefits over time over the course of the 5 years, Brett, based on various triggers and activity levels as opposed to as opposed to upon signing. Yes. And that bodes towards stock repurchases, Jonathan, with one major exception today which is we don't know that interest rates have stopped going up. And when interest rates go up, it immediately affects the cost on the revolver. We can always buy our stock back. And that -- we take comfort in that. But when you have an increasing interest rate environment where we don't know when it's over, we just think both from a business perspective and certainly a balance sheet perspective and from an accretion perspective, pay down the revolver balance while we have one as the way to go. Yes. I mean it's really the latter. But I mean, we've always said we would be open to a variety of structures I mean this, I think, evidence is that openness.

Yes. This would be a little different than that. This would be payments in exchange for AT&T having certain rights to use our towers. Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening and we look forward to getting back together in late October for our third quarter report. Thank you."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another steady quarter in Q2 with solid financial results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter or $626.1 million and cash site leasing revenues were $618.7 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $1.9 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $4.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.3% net over the second quarter of 2022 and including the impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.2%. The Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.8% on a gross basis and 4.2% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter declined from the first quarter. While all major carriers remained active with their networks, agreement execution levels in the second quarter from several of our customers were below our prior expectations. Longer term, we continue to see significant runway for new 5G-related leasing activity based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators. In addition, today, we announced that we have entered into a new long-term master lease agreement with AT&T. This comprehensive agreement will streamline AT&T's deployment of 5G solutions across our tower portfolio while providing us with committed future leasing growth from AT&T for years to come. Based on this MLA, we have increased our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from domestic organic new leases and amendments by $6 million from the full year projections we provided last quarter. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 42% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 58%. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 89% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was slightly elevated during the quarter, primarily due to faster decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected which is the opposite of our experience last year. Based on our current analysis, we expect Sprint related churn for 2023 will be at the high end of our previously stated range for this year of $25 million to $30 million, resulting in a change to our full year domestic churn outlook of $4 million. Our views around the ultimate multiyear cumulative impact of Sprint merger-related churn have not changed. Although we continue to update our outlook around timing as more information becomes available. We now project 2024 Sprint related churn to be in a range of $20 million to $30 million, 2025 to be between $35 million and $45 million. 2026 to be $45 million to $55 million and 2027 to be $10 million to $20 million. Just as last year ended up being well below our initial churn expectations and 2023 will likely be a little above our initial expectations, we anticipate that the exact timing will continue to be somewhat fluid but in line with our provided projections. Non-Sprint-related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections. Moving now to international results. On a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.8% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was strong in the second quarter and ahead of our internal expectations. These positive results and our solid backlogs have allowed us to increase our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from international organic new leases and amendments by $1 million. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make steady contributions to our organic growth. However, decreases in actual and projected Brazilian CPI rates have caused us to moderate our outlook for international escalation contributions for the full year by approximately $1 million. Overall, Brazil, our largest international market, had another very good quarter. The same tower organic growth rate in Brazil was 5.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.6% of churn which amount was significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. While international churn remains elevated, it continues to be in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the OI consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the oil consolidation that would be expected to have an impact on our current year we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the second quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 13.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $503.5 million, Tower cash flow in the quarter benefited by approximately $7.3 million in accounting-driven cost reclassifications. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.5% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.3% or 92.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $471.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $52.4 million in revenue and $13.1 million of segment operating profit. While off year ago activity levels, our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter and we have retained our full year outlook for our site development business due in part to the strength of our first half results. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $352.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.24, an increase of 6.2% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 9 communication sites for total cash consideration of $7.2 million and building 64 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 134 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $72.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites and during the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $10.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet. Yes. So on the MLA, first of all, on the numbers, the $6 million increase is basically due to the MLA. Obviously, that was our -- the 72% [ph] is what we reported last time, we increased to 78% and activity was a little bit slower in the second quarter. So we expect that the MLA will kick in right away based on the terms of it and will be a contributor going forward. In terms of the cadence would be fairly flat. I would expect actually that we'll see an uptick in terms of the contribution to the third quarter as a result of the and then you'll see it be a little bit lower into the fourth quarter. And that lower trajectory has nothing to do with the MLA. That's really based on slowing activity from other carriers. If you recall correctly, we had kind of a trajectory expected that was downward leaning throughout the year and I would expect that will continue as it relates to other contributors. In terms of why, Rick, this agreement with AT&T has been in the works for well over a year. And it's a deal that we believe is beneficial to both organizations. We've been working on it for that period of time and trying to signal and be transparent to our openness for this type of agreement knowing that we were likely to enter into this agreement which we have. We really don't want to comment too much on what's going on with other customers. But just as we have always said, we are not hung up so much on structure as we are on finding mutually beneficial agreements with our customers. Yes, Mike. So it will certainly smooth the way that we operate with AT&T. So I think from that perspective, perhaps it impacts our reported growth numbers in terms of ebbs and flows. There may be a little bit less of that, at least as it relates to this particular agreement. From a straight-line impact, we would expect that over the course of the agreement that we will have some straight-line impacts but there are no straight line -- or very minimal straight-line impacts in the short term. Yes. So on the first question, we do -- we expect that the fourth quarter run rate, you're talking specifically, just to be clear about domestic organic leasing contribution to be around approximately $17 million to $17.5 million. But I would definitely caution you as to using that as an indicator of next year. As I mentioned earlier, the trajectory based on activity levels is declining. And as a result, we would expect those numbers to step down as we move into next year. We're obviously not ready to give 2024 guidance yet at this point. but just kind of broadly when you think about it, the way we've always explained it and just the way that it actually happens is that you get a lot of growth, for instance, the 2023 growth is based heavily on the leasing activity that took place at the end of last year, 2022. And next year's numbers will be based heavily on the leasing activity that's taking place this year. So the number is a little bit higher than we said before because of the impacts of the MLA for the fourth quarter but I don't believe we'll be indicative of the numbers for next year. Yes, you mean just the percentage of the AT&T revenue or overall revenue? Right. John, we can't give specific numbers out. And obviously, a number of our agreements with other customers are fluid and where those amounts end up or obviously unknown. So as a percentage, it's hard to say as well. So we can't be very specific about it but we do have some portion of our revenue base that is locked in now under this agreement that wasn't before. It's 5 years, Jonathan. On the services question, David, we've had a lot of history. Actually, you recall, that's how SBA started. So we have a very flexible cost structure that allows us to ramp up, ramp down we use a lot of subcontracted tower crews. We have our own but we also use subcontracted tower crews. And 1 of the things that has really served us well and our customers give us high praise for this is by using our services people for work on our towers for them, they are greatly benefited in terms of speed to market and efficiencies. So I don't think that changes. So I guess if I had to choose 1 of your 2 options lean out or lean in, we'll look to lean in and not be afraid to do that because of our confidence in how we manage that business. I can't really answer that question, Walt, because there's so many elements that go into it. what would the activity be with AT&T, otherwise, those types of things. So I can't really say for sure what it would be, given that we were working on this for quite a while. [Technical Difficulty] First, we don't like to discuss the individual customers but obviously, DISH has just gotten through a major deadline that they had. There's a little bit of a slowdown or pause, if you will, related to that. And we would expect that will eventually pick up. But given the delay between signings and revenue recognition, I would expect that will weigh year-over-year on next year. and T-Mobile was frankly very, very busy as well and you have somewhat of a similar dynamic there. But that's what we're going into for next year. But longer term, there's still a lot to do there. So we can... If there was something incremental in what sense? Yes. I don't think there's something particularly new. I think it's been a little bit slower than what we had anticipated before. But directionally, it's still the same. So what does that mean for next year? Does that mean $5 million difference or $10 million. I can't tell you yet. We're not ready to get there and we still have half the year to go. But it's marginally worse than what we thought in terms of the balance of the other carriers. Yes. So I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question? Right. So it does -- there may be a few exceptions because of specific issues around individual sites but the vast majority of our sites are covered by the MLA. Yes, that have AT&T on of course. And then on the escalator piece, I can't really get into the specifics around what the escalator is but our historical escalator with AT&T has been north of 3% and we would expect that to continue. It would be. It would be if you took DISH out of the mix, you would have a much higher percentage of amendments of the total. No, we can't give you that kind of specificity now. Much less it was but it's much less than it was exiting last year. I mean it's hard to say because, obviously, previously, it would be very specific to the timing of when they were signing things. We don't know exactly what that timing would be. So could be pulling forward, could be pushing. Yes. So the other international was -- roughly half of that was in the second quarter. There is some that is in the balance of the year. And it's frankly a mix of things. It's not 1 thing in particular. There was some increased cash basis revenue recovery that we did not necessarily forecast and some that we've actually even seen subsequent to quarter end. And then also some termination fees. And just other frankly, cats and dogs, Nick but they did add up and we actually have higher expectations for the balance of the year. So that's that piece of it. On the accounting reclassification it basically has to do with the decommissioning of some carrier-related equipment, basically Sprint oriented equipment at some of our tower sites that we previously had expected or had been recording as a cost of revenue, a direct cost of revenue. But after discussion with our accountants, it was determined that the best classification for that was impairment and decommissioning costs. So basically, it's just a move of those costs out of cost of revenue and into impairment and decommission costs. There was some onetime true-up in there but that's the way to also be going forward and that's assumed within the guidance that we've given around tower cash flow. Yes. It's another roughly $4 million. Yes. And Brett, on the question around the straight line for the MLA, there actually was you couldn't see it but there is actually some small impact to straight line that was actually offset by a decrease in straight line associated with some of the accelerated Sprint churn that we mentioned earlier. So there is a small impact. But in terms of what it looks like going forward, obviously, what our peers have done and what we've done, they're probably not exactly the same agreements. I'm sure there are terms that are different. I can't speak to there specifically. But really, it's a function of timing in terms of when certain commitments take place. And in the future, I would expect that there will be some straight-line impact as a result of this deal but it's a little more activity driven than it is upfront. The accretion analysis takes into account a number of things. There's certainly the basic straightforward piece that you mentioned which is what's the yield of buying back our stock today versus what can we save by paying down the revolver or any debt. And right now, that actually is more accretive to pay down the revolver today. But we also look at it long term and we look at our expectations for growth. for growth and cash flow as well as what we think our future financing or refinancing costs will be and that positioning relative to our balance sheet as a whole is also relevant to it. And DISH in terms of the impact for the second half of the year, as we mentioned, it's obviously been slower in terms of new business being signed up with them. There's still a significant contributor to the second half numbers because of all the business that they did with us over the last year. But we expect that we'll continue to see, at least for this year, less executions with them. But ultimately, they have a ton to do, as we talked about to meet their 25% goal and we would expect that, that will turn around sometime at the end of the year or into next year. Well, based on the thresholds that are there by the agencies or at least by one of the agencies right now, we're getting very close to being there, certainly within a half turn of leverage of being there. but it would be more about the commitment to staying there than it would be about hitting the leverage tier. Yes. I think in terms of the details, we need to keep -- stay away from most of those. There's a lot of specific things that you asked about there that obviously are somewhat important for us to keep confidential for both us and our customers. But it is a 5-year agreement and there will be a lot of ramifications that I would expect would extend beyond the 5 years. In terms of the M&A in general, I think Jeff kind of answered this earlier. It's -- we've always been open to different structures, obviously, at different points in time in our history. We haven't necessarily found terms that we found to be beneficial to us or they didn't work for our customers, whatever the case may be. So we've done less of those. But we've done MLAs over the years in various structures, we have in MLA today with Verizon, we've had MLAs with T-Mobile and with DISH. So we've done these agreements before but each 1 is dependent upon the specifics around that carrier and their needs at the time and what works for both parties. So I don't know that anything has holistically changed out in the market broadly. Yes. On the oil question, you're talking specifically about deals with the other carriers that took over iWireless I believe yes, we are having conversations with those other carriers. And it's possible that there would be some other arrangements truck with them but it's premature for us to say. And obviously, if we do reach one, we'll let you know at that time. And then on the site development question, I would expect that the margins will stay pretty similar on a percentage basis to what you've seen during the first half of this year. The volume may be a hair lower but pretty flat. Your estimate of around 50 or so quarters is probably about right."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today\u2019s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 1 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make.  In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We started the year off with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectation and allowed us to increase our full-year 2023 outlook for most metrics.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022.  Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%.  Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter remains steady and was similar through the fourth quarter.  We again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenues signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was in-line with our prior quarter projections, and our full-year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again, with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continue to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their \u201822 highs. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed TIM agreement weighed on our first quarter, same-tower organic growth. This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn.  International churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding Oi consolidation related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high watermark for international churn.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation, other than associated with the TIM agreement, but if during the year we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time.  During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. During the first quarter, our services business had another strong quarter, with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end. Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year. During the first quarter, we continue to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter we also built 52 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 66 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I\u2019ll now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet. \nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter of $12.9 billion total debt and $12.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains at a strong 4.7x. During and subsequent to quarter end, we borrowed and repaid certain amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $595 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.8 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%.  The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and we currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 were $108.3 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $93.9 million or $0.85 per share. And today we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.85 per share, payable on June 21, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 27% of our projected full year AFFO.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Stoops: Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. The first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter. The focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand new colocations.  While we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons.  Some of AT&T's and Verizon\u2019s C-Band licenses will not be cleared until later this year. The C-Band and 3.45 gigahertz licenses won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority. Dual band radios are our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-Band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC and dual band radios supporting C-Band and CBRS are still pending approval. And DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multi-year continued development activity.  Also encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. The request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full-power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro-site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world.  Just as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide continued \u2013 a continued positive environment for SBA.  Internationally we also add a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa. Brazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big three carriers in that market, as well as good-sized contributions from CPI based escalators.  The integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly and these assets are performing well thus far, and we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full-year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country.  Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital. With respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately we do not have any debt materials until October 2024. Thus we do not need to issue incremental debt today, unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value.  We finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year absent other more compelling capital allocation.  While our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities. That of course can change quickly and we will be ready when it does. We ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value enhancing investment opportunities. As a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today we announced our second quarter dividend, consistently our first quarter dividend which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. This dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stocking purchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong. Last quarter I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard & Poor\u2019s to just below investment grade. Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase, this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have and the strength and stability of our underlying business. The future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023.  And with that Eric, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And first we will hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hi! Thanks for taking my question, guys. It looks like you did about $20 million or $21 million in leasing in the first quarter. The guidance implies may be 51 or so for the rest of the year. Should we think of the acceleration from here being fairly linear or is it going to have a bit of a different shape to it?\nJeff Stoops: It should be fairly linear Nick. The $21 million that you mentioned is about right for the first quarter and I would expect it to be kind of a gradual step down throughout the year. \nNick Del Deo: Okay, okay, good. And then with the strike to new builds overseas, looks like the pace stepped down quite a bit versus what you were doing in 2022. So I just want to know if that's kind of normal noise or if there's something more substantive that we should be cognizant of. \nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I think it's just a little bit of a slow gig out of the gate for the year. I don't think it's any more than that and we're not making any material adjustments to what we think we're about to do this year.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Which countries are you most focused on from a new build perspective? \nJeff Stoops: It really attracts our largest markets. So I would say outside the U.S., it would be Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania, but we will build towers I believe in every country in which we're currently operating for this year. \nBrendan Cavanagh: One thing Nick is that in Brazil a little bit of that slowdown is with the merger that took place among the carriers. There's some focus on that. So, that's put a little bit of a slowdown on the new builds temporarily, but we expect over time that will obviously come back and pick up.\nNick Del Deo: Okay, great. Well, thank you both. \nOperator: And next we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.\nJonathan Atkin : Thank you. So given the comment that you made Jeff about \u2013 I think it was Jeff, you made a comment about lack of \u2013 relative lack of compelling portfolio growth opportunities. I wondered why stock buybacks didn't kind of rank higher on the packing order in terms of capital allocation. And then secondly, as you think about U.S. leasing specifically, just wondering if you can maybe give us some of the puts and takes around any carriers that you might see even ramping on your portfolio, the activity level and then those that might be kind of tapering and what kind of rate of change do you expect. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, in terms of the stock repurchases, John, they are definitely high on our priority list as we demonstrated over the years and they will continue to be. We just feel like at this moment in time that we need to let the Fed do their thing and get to the point where we see that interest rates have stopped going up, because the rate that they are increasing has a direct impact on the cost of our revolving credit facility.  So we think through this particular period of time, and given the rate that we're paying on the revolver, that is absolutely the best use of our temporary capital allocations, but rest assured we will be buying material amounts of stock back over the coming years. In terms of the rate of changes of the carriers, and we don't want to get into too much detail about who's exactly doing what, and I think it's been fairly well broadcast that who was spending the most money last year, and who was the most active. T-Mobile and DISH really were the two big ones last year for the industry. Verizon and AT&T were busy. And that really hasn't changed a whole lot this year other than the aggregate amounts when you add it all up, what we expect for this year in terms of the volume of activity is going to be a little bit off from last year. \nJonathan Atkin : Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. \nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. I guess a follow-up, and sorry for not knowing this, but what is the size of that loan, meaning that how much more you need to pay down, obviously given the rate environment understood. What would you allocate there?\nJeff Stoops: So, the revolver is $595.0 million Wal and absent some other use of capital allocations, that'll be paid off by the end of this year.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. So, I mean, the rates have been so volatile obviously, but there's \u2013 can we assume there's just no reason to keep any of it, meaning that like we should just assume zero share repurchase until that's done. And then when it's done, you kind of unleash on the share repurchase or is there other elements in your cap structure that I'm not remembering that would impact the timing of when the share repurchase would kick back in. \nJeff Stoops: I think your intuition is, is directly correct. I mean, right now we're using dollars to pay back 6.5% debt. When that\u2019s paid down, we won\u2019t be earning 6.8% on our cash. So we'll be looking for other uses.\nWalter Piecyk: And then similar I guess question on the dividend, not that I'm ever complaining about steady dividend growth, because obviously that helps to broaden the investor base, but I guess I have to ask the question. Why increase the dividend to that amount, if at all, if it makes more sense to maybe get rid of that element of your debt?\nJeff Stoops: You know we're very confident of the debt, unless we spend additional money on something that will be obviously better, will be gone this year. So we didn't want to get off of a long-term dividend trend that we're trying to establish here just for the sake of less than a year.\nWalter Piecyk: Understood, and just one last question. I think the cable companies have been, this is my opinion, I don't know, I'm not stating this as facts, but maybe have been delayed in building infrastructure, maybe because of some vendor issues associated with some of the spectrum that they have. And I'm just curious, and it seems like that may be coming or that might be loosening up going forward. I'm just curious if you can kind of characterize any of relationships with, however you wanted to describe them. Basically I'm asking about the cable companies, in terms of as their subscribers and usage ramp, do you see an appetite for starting to add more assets on your towers? \nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I think they will for sure, but they rely very heavily on outsourcing to Verizon's network, at least Charter and Comcast. So with that in mind, it\u2019s kind of their built-in default system. What they have to do around their other spectrum that they can develop is more limited. We are getting some business from them, but of course it pales in comparison to the four traditional wireless service providers. \nWalter Piecyk: Yes, thank you. \nOperator: And next, we'll hear from David Arden with Bank of America. \nDavid Arden : Hey guys, thanks so much. I guess two questions if I could. I guess maybe Brendan this is for you. We're all kind of looking at DISH exposure and we're just basing the commentary and others. It feels like we're going to get to the mid-June build out requirements. Not clear how much beyond that we're going to go at DISH.  So I guess two questions would be, number one, if we take the 15,000 cell sites that they said that they were going to need to build this first stage of getting their licenses all locked down, and we multiply that by your percentage of domestic towers, and we assume that you've gotten roughly that percentage. It would seem like that would be roughly a $40 million or so number. Is your kind of run rate annualized exposure to Dish if you could kind of validate that or tell me where I'm wrong, that\u2019ll be helpful.  And then, second, with respect to kind of the second half of the year, given kind of where DISH\u2019s finance stand. What have you assumed in the guidance exit rate heading in the 2024? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh : Yeah David, first on your estimate of approximately how much they represent on a run rate, that's in the right ballpark today. We still continue to have activity though with them. They are still signing up new business, not the same pace they were a year ago. And so, we'll exit the year at something, obviously, greater than that, would be our expectation given the fact that we're constantly signing up new business. And then really, it's a question of, as they turn their sights towards their 2025 obligations how much more will be required. And we're pretty confident based on our conversations with them that there will be a good bit more required, so we'll have to see. But I think for the balance of this year, a lot of it is focused on deployment of a lot of what they've already signed up. And we'll see how much more they are able to churn to the 2025 objectives by the time we get to the end of the year. \nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I would just add that I think that's unknown at this point as to how much of the 2025 obligations will actually be booked or signed up in 2023. \nDavid Arden : Right, I think yeah, that's a good point. And if I could follow-up real quick, maybe Jeff, just on your comments regarding Brazil or maybe this is also Brendan. You mentioned that if there is some sort of new agreement that evolves as a function of the Oi situation, that you would change your outlook obviously. Should the market be expecting that that is a likelihood or should the market be expecting that that's unlikely to happen in 2023? Sorry, thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, the market should expect that it is more likely than not, but the market should take comfort in that, it will fall well within our estimated churn for Brazil that we've been putting forth now for quite some time. \nDavid Arden : Perfect! Alright, great! Thanks Jeff. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, just curious for your current thoughts on sustaining SBA's al-a-carte leasing framework for the domestic business, and if you have any new thoughts on the possibility of someday pivoting to a structure around comprehensive leases and comprehensive MLA's.  And then just secondly, if you can unpack, within this first quarter churn, the amount that specifically came from the Sprint merger decommissioning. Thanks.\nA - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, on the al-a-carte versus the \u2013 what I think are most commonly called holistic MLA's, you know we're very open to whatever makes the most sense for our customers and for us. We have not \u2013 we've done MLA's, we've not done holistic MLA's that provide a customer with kind of all you can need equipment rights up to a specified amount in exchange for some kind of pricing benefit. Although we almost did back in 2013, 2014, we came very close to doing that. So I think you should take all that Michael as kind of our view that it continues our kind of opportunistic way of running the business and we will do what's right for us and our customers at that time. And that you should not assume that you won't ever see that kind of agreement from us in the future.\nBrendan Cavanagh: And Mike, on the Sprint churn question in the first quarter, $6.5 million of the churn, incremental churn to Q1 was related to Sprint. \nMichael Rollins : Thanks. \nA - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Brandon Nispel with Keybanc Capital Market.\nBrandon Nispel : Great! Multipart question for you Jeff. Can you talk about booking's activity in terms of unsigned lease applications and how that's trending this quarter from like a year-over-year perspective?  Then you had mentioned a number of drivers in terms of why we should still be bullish on 5G investments, including Verizon, AT&T, CBAN that\u2019s not being cleared, T-Mobile licenses, dual band radios and DISH. Which of these is the largest potential driver for leasing for you over the next couple of years. Thanks. \nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I think the \u2013 well, the biggest drivers will be the ones that I believe are most likely. It's got to be the dual band equipment. And obviously we need to get the T-Mobile licenses that they went and paid for, freed up out of the FCC. So those will be drivers that really get \u2013 and we know that the CBAN spectrum will be cleared by the end of this year, which just particularly in AT&T's case will coincide with when they'll see good availability of the dual band 3.45 and CBAN radios. So all those things I think are going to be positively impactful you know late \u201923, certainly into 20224.  And because I answered your second question first \u2013 oh, the backlog. Yeah, the backlog is probably down a little bit from where it was a year ago, but it's been holding steady for the last quarter or two. \nBrandon Nispel : Great, thanks. And one follow-up, when do you expect to see lease applications for some of these dual band radios? Thanks.\nA - Jeff Stoops: I would say second half of the year, and then pick it up as you move through the year, the end of the year.\nBrandon Nispel : Will they just \u2013 I believe it might have even been just last week that the FCC approved by  waiver, the 3.45 and the C-Band dual radio equipment from Ericsson.\nJeff Stoops: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRic Prentiss : Hey everybody! \nA - Jeff Stoops: Hey Ric!\nRic Prentiss : Hey, I wanted to follow-up on Walt\u2019s question about the dividend. You mentioned that the long term churn in the dividend, when do you think dividend payout ratio caps off and does that kind of imply 20% growth is here for a good percent of your future subject to votability [ph]?\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I would think it's not going to be a steady 20%. I would think it will \u2013 as it has since we started the dividend, it will decline a little bit each year or so over time so we can continue \u2013 while still increasing that, what may be the REIT industry's fastest growth dividend, still growing at a very fast clip, while we maintain a relatively low, relative to our peers AFFO payout ratio. That's been the strategy from the start Ric.\nRic Prentiss : Right, right. You guys have been a very good allocator of capital. Is there a capital that's obviously got some international properties that are probably not covered by the REIT exclusion in the U.S. Just wondering, was the cap out like at 70%, 80% or anything?\nBrendan Cavanagh: It should be much less than that. I mean maybe way out long term, I would say its closer to 45%, 50%, because ultimately when we're through our NOLs, it will obviously match our net income, or taxable net income. So at this stage the relationship of the tax net income to AFFO is somewhere in that 40% to 50% range.\nRic Prentiss : Okay. And then you mentioned to David's question on the Oi insurance, can you just remind us of what the total Oi insurance or is that still left to be addressed possibly and how that's factored into what your total results are number wise?\nA - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, so related specifically to the Oi consolidation risk, I think you're asking, the total exposure we've ball-parked in the $25 million to $35 million range. We've through the TIM deal, that represents about $10 million of churn that we've locked in, that's in our 2023 guidance. There's nothing in there for anybody else at this point. None of those leases are up. So if it were to be added into this year through an agreement, it would be pulling some of that forward. But the total range we still think is a fair estimate over time of $25 million to $35 million, of which $10 million is already in.\nRic Prentiss : Follow-on for me, on the Sprint churn, a follow-up on Mike's question, $6.5 million is in the first quarter with another $25 million to $30 million Sprint churn is in \u201823. Remind us of what's left out there in kind of the timeframes that you expect coming in maybe in \u201924, \u201925, \u201926, just so you have those carrier consolidations and those kind of make sure that the market's got those similar models. \nA - Brendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it's pretty much the same as it's been in the past. Our big years are \u201825 and \u201826, where we would estimate somewhere about $45 million to $50 million in each of those years. Next year as we sit here today, we think we'll be a little bit lower in the $15 million to $20 million range and then as I said, $45 million to $50 million to the following two years, and then there's some marginal amount after that, probably $10 million to $20 million that kind of dribbles out into the future. So that's the full exposure of what's left after this year. \nRic Prentiss : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. To the extent that you moved forward with holistic deals, could you talk about if that would change your view on leverage targets? And getting pretty close with investment grade and \u201825 seems to be a year where you have a bunch of issues coming in, can we expect you to put that as a top priority in the near term?  And then, another question on the activity, Verizon suggests that lighting up most C-band spectrum is now going to require new antennas. What's your view of more C-band spectrum coming in? Would you think that that would create more activity? Thank you.\nA - Jeff Stoops: On the spectrum that the CTI wrote to the White House about? A brand new spectrum? Yeah, I mean there's some antenna efficiencies that may allow that to happen depending on the spectrum, but there are no radio efficiencies. There has to be new radios that are frequency specific. They could be dual band or multi band, but they are not in any of the equipment today for the spectrum that has not yet been auctioned, so that's a real opportunity should that spectrum become available.  In terms of our leverage, one of the reasons that we \u2013 there are several reasons, but one of the reasons that we're using our free cash flow to pay down the revolver is exactly to your point Batya, which is to see how the Fed, how they do in their war against inflation. If they succeed, we believe rates will come down and we will kind of go back exactly to the way we have done business for 20 years.  If it looks like it is more permanent that we're going to be in a higher rate environment and inflation doesn\u2019t come under control, then we'll take a much more serious look at turning investment grade, which will actually position to do fairly well and over a manageable period of time, if that's in fact what we choose to do?  I think the macro world will play itself out in the next year and we will be able to tell you with much more specificity exactly which of those paths we're going to take.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: And next we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Jeff, you said the M&A market was pretty slow. I wonder if you could just expand on that. Is it that there's just not much available or not much available at attractive prices? And then I was wondering if you could just also, just expand on the infill comment and we've heard a lot of bullish stuff from the telcos on FWA and I was just wondering if you're having more conversations about, if they wanted to add capacity for that, what that might mean for their bill programs over the medium term?\nA - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, in terms of M&A, it's a combination of both of those things Simon. There's just not a lot that's being offered for sale or shopped around I mean and that's a global comment relative to past times. I think it's a combination of the interest rate environment and I think it's a combination \u2013 and added to that would be the \u2013 it's a closing gap, but there's still a gap between buyer and seller expectation. There's really, and we keep pretty close tabs on all opportunities out there and there's really not a lot. And even the fewer that we would find attractive as evidenced by the fact that we did the amounts and everything this quarter.\nSimon Flannery: And are you mostly looking in your existing markets or would you be open to new markets?\nA - Jeff Stoops: Yeah, we'd be open for the right opportunity similar to our past practices. We would obviously be careful and thoughtful, but we're not foreclosing new markets.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And anything on infill you could share on, you know if they do decide to act\u2026 [Cross Talk]\nJeff Stoops: Our customers have all been very, and they haven't said anything different to us, have all been very careful to describe fixed wireless as a product that really is just for excess capacity on the 5G network and I don't know if that'll change or not. I mean, they're all \u2013 well, the ones that are offering it more intentionally are doing very well. So, I mean you could see at some point that there is specific capital allocation, purely justified off of the fixed wireless. But I cannot tell you today that any activity that we're seeing is predominantly there because of fixed wireless.\nSimon Flannery: Right, and perhaps your comments around the CTIA study, that might be a \u2013 some of that spectrum might be good for fixed wireless as well. \nJeff Stoops: Oh yeah, it absolutely would be. But you got to have to deploy it. You got to have to deploy at a minimum radios for that and in most cases probably antennas too.\nSimon Flannery: Great! Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys. So two different subjects if I can. First, there's been a lot of discussion of DISH. Credit markets are concerned what would happen there. Can you remind us where at DISH your contracts lie? And if DISH were to stop building, what your sort of remaining security looks like.  And then second, completely different. South Africa, there's been a lot of power issues and growing power issues. Any changes in how you address this on your tower's interested involvement in supporting the country in power and your carriers? Thank you.\nA - Jeff Stoops: I'll take the South Africa question and Brendan, you could take the DISH question if you have the answer. We know it's at the spectrum holding level Phil. I mean, that's probably about as best as we can. We can get back to you with the exact legal entity if you'd like, but it's with the entity that has the spectrum.  So on the South Africa question, you know power is an issue and there is a movement effort by some carriers, particularly \u2013 well, I'm not going to name them specifically, but to outsource power on the towers. And it is something that we\u2019re looking at. The bigger issue in South Africa and one that we're working on and hopefully we'll have something meaningful for both us and our customers in the future, is security.  And we really don't want to spend a lot of money on power supply, solving those issues until you have the site facilities secured, and that involves a wide range of potential solutions Phil, which we've got a lot of folks looking at and studying and I think we'll be able to share more with you on that over the coming year. \nPhil Cusick: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. Two questions if you don't mind. For many years now in the U.S., a lot of the new tower that have been constructed have been done by privately funded operators who achieve access to capital or signing leases with their carrier tenants with terms that we just \u2013 we're never going to match, and as a result we haven't seen develop a lot of towers in the U.S. for a number of years now.  I'm curious what the market for a new site development in the U.S. looks like. It would seem that with the carriers using higher frequencies than they've ever used before, there'd be some need for identification of the actual infrastructure. But I really don't know, so I\u2019m curious whether that could be an opportunity for you.  And then a separate topic, American tower sold their Mexican fiber business, citing that it really has ended up being a more difficult business than they thought. You've been pretty selective in terms of where you've invested in fiber in your international market. I'm curious how those businesses are performing and whether maybe you're considering any portfolio lending there as well. Thank you.\nJeff Stoops: Well, other than some assets which are very de minimis to the operation of our data center in Brazil or our towers internationally, we don't have any fiber businesses internationally Brett, so nothing really to divest there.  In terms of new builds, over time they should continue to be a steady, although I don't know if it will be growing number of new build opportunities. The new build market in the U.S. has slowed somewhat as carriers have focused more on amending their existing sites to roll out most efficiently their 5G. And I will also tell you that the cost of new builds have gone up tremendously in the last five years. They may have doubled over that period of time. So I think that's providing a bit of a damper on activities as well. \nBrett Feldman: Are you still seeing those same private operators out there bidding for what\u2019s available or has that cooled down at some degree? \nJeff Stoops: Yeah, the same names are still out there, but the volumes are well down.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: Great, thanks for taking my question. Jeff, you mentioned the dual-band radios. I was wondering if you give us a little bit more color on that and what you're expecting from the carriers. Have they been holding back in anticipation of this or what do you really expect them to change starting in the second half once you get those applications?\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I don't want to speak for our customers, but I will tell you that the literature that's available on this topic from organizations like Light Reading [ph] for example really go into quite a bit of detail as to what our customers plans are with respect to those dual band radios, including one of our customers said to not deploy any of certain amounts of spectrum that they already have until those dual-band radios are. So I mean that's what I know and I don't want to really talk more about specific customer discussions, but I think if you look at that literature, you will see a picture that is very clear that there's, there has been holdback in terms of what our customers would otherwise do, pending the availability of that type of equipment.  And in particular, you know right now the deployment is a separate radio and antenna for C-Band and 3.45. It'll be a more efficient form function when they are combined and to the extent that they were doing that in one truck roll with the two different radios, they would have the efficiencies of a single truck roll. So that's a long-winded way of saying, yeah, we think it's going to be a positive development when that equipment is available. \nBrendan Lynch: Great, thanks, that's helpful. And maybe one balance sheet question for Brendan. Accounts receivable was flat quarter-to-quarter around $183 million, but it's up quite a bit relative to the trailing 12-month average price of that. Is there anything specific that is causing that to occur?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Not really, because we are obviously focused on aged accounts receivable, which are not \u2013 we're doing fine on collections. So a lot of that's really just timing around some of the services contracts, generally services related in terms of fluctuations not leasing.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color. \nOperator: Next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. \nDavid Guarino: Thanks. Hey Jeff, I want to talk about that CTIA report you mentioned. What do you think would happen to U.S. macro tower new leasing activity? If the SEC was unsuccessful and they couldn't get access to new build in that spectrum, do you think we'd see growth trail off from the 5% rate, pretty significantly once the C-band spectrum is installed?\nJeff Stoops: Well, I think you'd see a tremendous amount of increased densification, because that will be the only way to satisfy demand in a spectrum constrained environment. The question is, it's the age-old question, who's going to pay for that and are our customer's buying going to find a good enough return on investment? I mean if there\u2019s no more spectrum Dave, there has to be self-splitting and densification.\nDavid Guarino: Okay, and I guess maybe to dive into the densification side, there's ample opportunity within your portfolio for that to happen, right? I wouldn't be fair to say during the 4G build-out the majority that already occurred?\nJeff Stoops: I would say to densify within the existing spectrum and to have no additional spectrum introduced into the system. If you were going to truly build out to the max, to achieve the max 5G capabilities, I would tell you, we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room on our towers that would need to be filled for our customers to achieve that.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. Maybe stepping outside of the U.S., and it's been, I guess it's been over a year since you guys set up operations in the Philippines. Could you just maybe update us on how many sites you own in the country now, and then another with a lot of M&O tower assets sales? Are there any rumors about on the horizon of maybe the M&O's looking to sell some more assets?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, we've got about 130 or so sites right now, then a bunch more in construction, so we would expect to end the year in the high 100s somewhere.\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, and the M&O's have followed up, I mean there are two real M&O's. There's three, but two that really own assets over there, and those customers have continued to hive off chunks of their portfolios, not sure that they've done it too many times, but I know there have been follow-ups I think from each of the two big ones there with additional asset sales.\nDavid Guarino: But nothing else on the horizon that you are aware off? \nJeff Stoops: Not that we are aware of? \nDavid Guarino: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just curious, for the two large U.S. carriers that are already deploying C-band today, any kind of rough estimate on how many of your sites has been upgraded just to give us a sense for how long the growth there will be in the next few years?\nJeff Stoops: Below 50%,\nEric Luebchow: Okay, helpful. And I guess when you think about the dual band radios, is there any real difference in your ability to monetize amendments, whether they are separate C-band and 3.45 radios, or if it's a dual-band, is it relatively equivalent in terms of your amendment revenue?\nJeff Stoops: Yeah, I would say it's roughly equivalent, although the form factor is going to be less from a weight perspective in the dual band unified piece of equipment. \nEric Luebchow: Got it, makes sense. And just last for me, I know you've made a couple of smaller data-centered investments kind of studying the edge compute market I guess. Have you had any learnings from those or anything to report that maybe could give you some confidence to get bigger in that space over time, either through new development or M&A?\nJeff Stoops: Well, where we've continued to grow is in the edge and the fiber regeneration facilities. We are now up to somewhere between 40 and 50 of those. So what we found Eric is that there is high demand for quality locations where you have power and permitting and fiber. What really has not happened yet to our knowledge anywhere in the globe is the direct tie-in at the edge of the cell site to the wireless networks, which when that comes, that will unleash tremendous amount of demand at the cell site. But we're learning a lot along the way through primarily real estate demand as opposed to demand for this computing to be tied in to the wireless networks.\nEric Luebchow: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: And next we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.\nGreg Williams: Great, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on services. Your site development came in a bit stronger. Should we expect that also to sort of come down a little bit linearly? And second question is just on the dual-band radio opportunity on network services. So if T-Mobile and AT&T start deploying that, could we see an uptick in our services above and beyond your guidance? Thanks.\nJeff Stoops: Yeah Greg, we would think that services will be declining slightly into the second half of the year, but I think in a lesser pace. I mean, you can see what our outlook looks like and where the first quarter ended up. It's only slightly ahead of that full year pace. So probably similar in the second quarter and maybe slightly less in the second half of the year, but relatively flat.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. And when the dual-band deployment start Greg, certainly that's going to benefit our services business. \nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. \nJeff Stoops: Great. We want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. We appreciate your participation and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. The first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter. The focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand new colocations.  While we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons.  Some of AT&T's and Verizon's C-Band licenses will not be cleared until later this year. The C-Band and 3.45 gigahertz licenses won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority. Dual band radios are our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-Band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC and dual band radios supporting C-Band and CBRS are still pending approval. And DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multi-year continued development activity.  Also encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. The request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full-power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro-site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world.  Just as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide continued \u2013 a continued positive environment for SBA.  Internationally we also add a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa. Brazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big three carriers in that market, as well as good-sized contributions from CPI based escalators.  The integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly and these assets are performing well thus far, and we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full-year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country.  Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital. With respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately we do not have any debt materials until October 2024. Thus we do not need to issue incremental debt today, unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value.  We finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year absent other more compelling capital allocation.  While our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities. That of course can change quickly and we will be ready when it does. We ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value enhancing investment opportunities. As a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today we announced our second quarter dividend, consistently our first quarter dividend which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. This dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stocking purchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong. Last quarter I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard & Poor's to just below investment grade. Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase, this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have and the strength and stability of our underlying business. The future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023.  And with that Eric, we are now ready for questions. It should be fairly linear Nick. The $21 million that you mentioned is about right for the first quarter and I would expect it to be kind of a gradual step down throughout the year. Yeah, I think it's just a little bit of a slow gig out of the gate for the year. I don't think it's any more than that and we're not making any material adjustments to what we think we're about to do this year. It really attracts our largest markets. So I would say outside the U.S., it would be Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania, but we will build towers I believe in every country in which we're currently operating for this year. Yeah, in terms of the stock repurchases, John, they are definitely high on our priority list as we demonstrated over the years and they will continue to be. We just feel like at this moment in time that we need to let the Fed do their thing and get to the point where we see that interest rates have stopped going up, because the rate that they are increasing has a direct impact on the cost of our revolving credit facility.  So we think through this particular period of time, and given the rate that we're paying on the revolver, that is absolutely the best use of our temporary capital allocations, but rest assured we will be buying material amounts of stock back over the coming years. In terms of the rate of changes of the carriers, and we don't want to get into too much detail about who's exactly doing what, and I think it's been fairly well broadcast that who was spending the most money last year, and who was the most active. T-Mobile and DISH really were the two big ones last year for the industry. Verizon and AT&T were busy. And that really hasn't changed a whole lot this year other than the aggregate amounts when you add it all up, what we expect for this year in terms of the volume of activity is going to be a little bit off from last year. So, the revolver is $595.0 million Wal and absent some other use of capital allocations, that'll be paid off by the end of this year. I think your intuition is, is directly correct. I mean, right now we're using dollars to pay back 6.5% debt. When that's paid down, we won't be earning 6.8% on our cash. So we'll be looking for other uses. You know we're very confident of the debt, unless we spend additional money on something that will be obviously better, will be gone this year. So we didn't want to get off of a long-term dividend trend that we're trying to establish here just for the sake of less than a year. Yeah, I think they will for sure, but they rely very heavily on outsourcing to Verizon's network, at least Charter and Comcast. So with that in mind, it's kind of their built-in default system. What they have to do around their other spectrum that they can develop is more limited. We are getting some business from them, but of course it pales in comparison to the four traditional wireless service providers. Yeah, I would just add that I think that's unknown at this point as to how much of the 2025 obligations will actually be booked or signed up in 2023. Yeah, the market should expect that it is more likely than not, but the market should take comfort in that, it will fall well within our estimated churn for Brazil that we've been putting forth now for quite some time. Yeah, I think the \u2013 well, the biggest drivers will be the ones that I believe are most likely. It's got to be the dual band equipment. And obviously we need to get the T-Mobile licenses that they went and paid for, freed up out of the FCC. So those will be drivers that really get \u2013 and we know that the CBAN spectrum will be cleared by the end of this year, which just particularly in AT&T's case will coincide with when they'll see good availability of the dual band 3.45 and CBAN radios. So all those things I think are going to be positively impactful you know late '23, certainly into 20224.  And because I answered your second question first \u2013 oh, the backlog. Yeah, the backlog is probably down a little bit from where it was a year ago, but it's been holding steady for the last quarter or two. Got it, thank you. Yeah, I would think it's not going to be a steady 20%. I would think it will \u2013 as it has since we started the dividend, it will decline a little bit each year or so over time so we can continue \u2013 while still increasing that, what may be the REIT industry's fastest growth dividend, still growing at a very fast clip, while we maintain a relatively low, relative to our peers AFFO payout ratio. That's been the strategy from the start Ric. Our customers have all been very, and they haven't said anything different to us, have all been very careful to describe fixed wireless as a product that really is just for excess capacity on the 5G network and I don't know if that'll change or not. I mean, they're all \u2013 well, the ones that are offering it more intentionally are doing very well. So, I mean you could see at some point that there is specific capital allocation, purely justified off of the fixed wireless. But I cannot tell you today that any activity that we're seeing is predominantly there because of fixed wireless. Oh yeah, it absolutely would be. But you got to have to deploy it. You got to have to deploy at a minimum radios for that and in most cases probably antennas too. Well, other than some assets which are very de minimis to the operation of our data center in Brazil or our towers internationally, we don't have any fiber businesses internationally Brett, so nothing really to divest there.  In terms of new builds, over time they should continue to be a steady, although I don't know if it will be growing number of new build opportunities. The new build market in the U.S. has slowed somewhat as carriers have focused more on amending their existing sites to roll out most efficiently their 5G. And I will also tell you that the cost of new builds have gone up tremendously in the last five years. They may have doubled over that period of time. So I think that's providing a bit of a damper on activities as well. Yeah, the same names are still out there, but the volumes are well down. Yeah, I don't want to speak for our customers, but I will tell you that the literature that's available on this topic from organizations like Light Reading [ph] for example really go into quite a bit of detail as to what our customers plans are with respect to those dual band radios, including one of our customers said to not deploy any of certain amounts of spectrum that they already have until those dual-band radios are. So I mean that's what I know and I don't want to really talk more about specific customer discussions, but I think if you look at that literature, you will see a picture that is very clear that there's, there has been holdback in terms of what our customers would otherwise do, pending the availability of that type of equipment.  And in particular, you know right now the deployment is a separate radio and antenna for C-Band and 3.45. It'll be a more efficient form function when they are combined and to the extent that they were doing that in one truck roll with the two different radios, they would have the efficiencies of a single truck roll. So that's a long-winded way of saying, yeah, we think it's going to be a positive development when that equipment is available. Well, I think you'd see a tremendous amount of increased densification, because that will be the only way to satisfy demand in a spectrum constrained environment. The question is, it's the age-old question, who's going to pay for that and are our customer's buying going to find a good enough return on investment? I mean if there's no more spectrum Dave, there has to be self-splitting and densification. I would say to densify within the existing spectrum and to have no additional spectrum introduced into the system. If you were going to truly build out to the max, to achieve the max 5G capabilities, I would tell you, we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room on our towers that would need to be filled for our customers to achieve that. Yeah, and the M&O's have followed up, I mean there are two real M&O's. There's three, but two that really own assets over there, and those customers have continued to hive off chunks of their portfolios, not sure that they've done it too many times, but I know there have been follow-ups I think from each of the two big ones there with additional asset sales. Not that we are aware of? Below 50%, Yeah, I would say it's roughly equivalent, although the form factor is going to be less from a weight perspective in the dual band unified piece of equipment. Well, where we've continued to grow is in the edge and the fiber regeneration facilities. We are now up to somewhere between 40 and 50 of those. So what we found Eric is that there is high demand for quality locations where you have power and permitting and fiber. What really has not happened yet to our knowledge anywhere in the globe is the direct tie-in at the edge of the cell site to the wireless networks, which when that comes, that will unleash tremendous amount of demand at the cell site. But we're learning a lot along the way through primarily real estate demand as opposed to demand for this computing to be tied in to the wireless networks. Yeah Greg, we would think that services will be declining slightly into the second half of the year, but I think in a lesser pace. I mean, you can see what our outlook looks like and where the first quarter ended up. It's only slightly ahead of that full year pace. So probably similar in the second quarter and maybe slightly less in the second half of the year, but relatively flat. Great. We want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. We appreciate your participation and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Yeah. Yeah, so related specifically to the Oi consolidation risk, I think you're asking, the total exposure we've ball-parked in the $25 million to $35 million range. We've through the TIM deal, that represents about $10 million of churn that we've locked in, that's in our 2023 guidance. There's nothing in there for anybody else at this point. None of those leases are up. So if it were to be added into this year through an agreement, it would be pulling some of that forward. But the total range we still think is a fair estimate over time of $25 million to $35 million, of which $10 million is already in. Yeah, it's pretty much the same as it's been in the past. Our big years are \u201825 and \u201826, where we would estimate somewhere about $45 million to $50 million in each of those years. Next year as we sit here today, we think we'll be a little bit lower in the $15 million to $20 million range and then as I said, $45 million to $50 million to the following two years, and then there's some marginal amount after that, probably $10 million to $20 million that kind of dribbles out into the future. So that's the full exposure of what's left after this year."

            "name": "A - Jeff Stoops",
            "content": "Yeah, on the al-a-carte versus the \u2013 what I think are most commonly called holistic MLA's, you know we're very open to whatever makes the most sense for our customers and for us. We have not \u2013 we've done MLA's, we've not done holistic MLA's that provide a customer with kind of all you can need equipment rights up to a specified amount in exchange for some kind of pricing benefit. Although we almost did back in 2013, 2014, we came very close to doing that. So I think you should take all that Michael as kind of our view that it continues our kind of opportunistic way of running the business and we will do what's right for us and our customers at that time. And that you should not assume that you won't ever see that kind of agreement from us in the future. I would say second half of the year, and then pick it up as you move through the year, the end of the year. Hey Ric! On the spectrum that the CTI wrote to the White House about? A brand new spectrum? Yeah, I mean there's some antenna efficiencies that may allow that to happen depending on the spectrum, but there are no radio efficiencies. There has to be new radios that are frequency specific. They could be dual band or multi band, but they are not in any of the equipment today for the spectrum that has not yet been auctioned, so that's a real opportunity should that spectrum become available.  In terms of our leverage, one of the reasons that we \u2013 there are several reasons, but one of the reasons that we're using our free cash flow to pay down the revolver is exactly to your point Batya, which is to see how the Fed, how they do in their war against inflation. If they succeed, we believe rates will come down and we will kind of go back exactly to the way we have done business for 20 years.  If it looks like it is more permanent that we're going to be in a higher rate environment and inflation doesn't come under control, then we'll take a much more serious look at turning investment grade, which will actually position to do fairly well and over a manageable period of time, if that's in fact what we choose to do?  I think the macro world will play itself out in the next year and we will be able to tell you with much more specificity exactly which of those paths we're going to take. Yeah, in terms of M&A, it's a combination of both of those things Simon. There's just not a lot that's being offered for sale or shopped around I mean and that's a global comment relative to past times. I think it's a combination of the interest rate environment and I think it's a combination \u2013 and added to that would be the \u2013 it's a closing gap, but there's still a gap between buyer and seller expectation. There's really, and we keep pretty close tabs on all opportunities out there and there's really not a lot. And even the fewer that we would find attractive as evidenced by the fact that we did the amounts and everything this quarter. Yeah, we'd be open for the right opportunity similar to our past practices. We would obviously be careful and thoughtful, but we're not foreclosing new markets. I'll take the South Africa question and Brendan, you could take the DISH question if you have the answer. We know it's at the spectrum holding level Phil. I mean, that's probably about as best as we can. We can get back to you with the exact legal entity if you'd like, but it's with the entity that has the spectrum.  So on the South Africa question, you know power is an issue and there is a movement effort by some carriers, particularly \u2013 well, I'm not going to name them specifically, but to outsource power on the towers. And it is something that we're looking at. The bigger issue in South Africa and one that we're working on and hopefully we'll have something meaningful for both us and our customers in the future, is security.  And we really don't want to spend a lot of money on power supply, solving those issues until you have the site facilities secured, and that involves a wide range of potential solutions Phil, which we've got a lot of folks looking at and studying and I think we'll be able to share more with you on that over the coming year."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We started the year off with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectation and allowed us to increase our full-year 2023 outlook for most metrics.  Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022.  Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%.  Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter remains steady and was similar through the fourth quarter.  We again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenues signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was in-line with our prior quarter projections, and our full-year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn.  Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again, with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continue to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their \u201822 highs. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed TIM agreement weighed on our first quarter, same-tower organic growth. This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn.  International churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding Oi consolidation related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high watermark for international churn.  As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation, other than associated with the TIM agreement, but if during the year we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time.  During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. During the first quarter, our services business had another strong quarter, with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end. Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year. During the first quarter, we continue to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter we also built 52 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 66 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I'll now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet. One thing Nick is that in Brazil a little bit of that slowdown is with the merger that took place among the carriers. There's some focus on that. So, that's put a little bit of a slowdown on the new builds temporarily, but we expect over time that will obviously come back and pick up. Yeah David, first on your estimate of approximately how much they represent on a run rate, that's in the right ballpark today. We still continue to have activity though with them. They are still signing up new business, not the same pace they were a year ago. And so, we'll exit the year at something, obviously, greater than that, would be our expectation given the fact that we're constantly signing up new business. And then really, it's a question of, as they turn their sights towards their 2025 obligations how much more will be required. And we're pretty confident based on our conversations with them that there will be a good bit more required, so we'll have to see. But I think for the balance of this year, a lot of it is focused on deployment of a lot of what they've already signed up. And we'll see how much more they are able to churn to the 2025 objectives by the time we get to the end of the year. And Mike, on the Sprint churn question in the first quarter, $6.5 million of the churn, incremental churn to Q1 was related to Sprint. It should be much less than that. I mean maybe way out long term, I would say its closer to 45%, 50%, because ultimately when we're through our NOLs, it will obviously match our net income, or taxable net income. So at this stage the relationship of the tax net income to AFFO is somewhere in that 40% to 50% range. Not really, because we are obviously focused on aged accounts receivable, which are not \u2013 we're doing fine on collections. So a lot of that's really just timing around some of the services contracts, generally services related in terms of fluctuations not leasing. Yeah, we've got about 130 or so sites right now, then a bunch more in construction, so we would expect to end the year in the high 100s somewhere. Yeah. And when the dual-band deployment start Greg, certainly that's going to benefit our services business."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 28, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page on Investor release on website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to comment on the third quarter.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. Operationally, the third quarter ended up rolling out largely as we expected, with leasing results in-line with our outlook and services results a little ahead of our outlook. Foreign exchange rates were a little stronger than our estimates a quarter ago, and domestic new carrier activity was up from the first half of the new year. All of these items combined to allow us to increase our full year 2024 outlook across all of our key financial metrics. In the US, new business executions were up from the prior three quarters. And applications and inquiries have increased as well. We are beginning to see a shift in the makeup of our new business signed up and applications with a growing percentage coming from new lease [co-locations] (ph) versus amendments to existing leases. We anticipate this trend continuing into 2025. All of our major customers have significant network needs over the next few years as mobile network consumption continues to grow at a healthy pace. The limitation of new spectrum availability over the next several years will challenge our customers to meet the demands on their networks through incremental equipment deployment and densification of sites. Our macro tower portfolio should be a beneficiary of this dynamic. Other growth drivers, which we have discussed before, such as fixed wireless access, the incorporation of new generative AI capabilities into handsets, regulatory build-out commitments and remaining 5G coverage expansion will all contribute to a healthy network investment environment over the next several years. In addition, our customer relationships are strong. We are a trusted and valued partner to each of them. We are very focused on helping them to achieve their objectives through providing exceptional service and quality. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change much from quarter-to-quarter, but consistently delivering over time, as we have done for the past 35 years, is the best way to be our customers' first choice provider and ultimately, to maximize growth for our shareholders. Internationally, we have adopted the same philosophy. And as a result, we are seen as a valued partner to our carrier customers in each of our largest markets. The quarter was solid with international leasing results in-line with our expectations, and we expect a solid finish to the year. The broader market internationally though, still presents some challenges as we manage through customer consolidations and network rationalization. However, we see light at the end of this tunnel as the surviving customers are stronger and better positioned to invest in growing their wireless product offerings and their ARPUs. To accomplish this, increased network investment will be required, 5G upgrades across all of our international markets are really just at the very beginning. And wireless broadband consumption is growing across our markets just as fast, if not faster, than the US. Overall, we believe our International business will continue to be additive to our organic growth profile over time and the long-term prospects are still very good. As part of maximizing the long-term prospects of our International business, we continue to strategically review our operations and future potential in each of our existing markets. As I have shared with you before, we believe that in order to create the longest -- the greatest -- excuse me, long-term stability and the opportunity to maximize growth in a particular market, it is important to be of scale and positioned as an industry leader in that market and to be closely aligned with the leading wireless carriers in the market as well. In alignment with that effort, we are very pleased to share with you today's announcement of a purchase agreement signed with Millicom International Cellular, for the acquisition of over 7,000 sites throughout Central America, for an initial cash purchase price of approximately $975 million. Pro forma for this transaction, SBA will be the largest tower company across the region. We are very excited to increase our partnership with Millicom and to help them grow their business for many years to come. The assets are located across five countries in Central America, increasing SBA scale in four of those countries where we already have operations. The assets are anticipated to produce approximately $129 million in site leasing revenue and $89 million in tower cash flow during the first full year of operations after closing. And significantly all of the cash flow will be denominated in US dollars. Millicom will be a tenant on each site under a leaseback arrangement in which they have committed to an initial 15-year term. In addition, as part of the leasing arrangement, Millicom has agreed to extend all of their approximately 1,500 existing leases with SBA that exist on our existing assets in the region for a new 15-year term. SBA and Millicom have also entered into a new build-to-suit agreement under which SBA will exclusively build up to 2,500 new sites in Central America for Millicom over the next seven years. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and we expect it will close sometime in mid- to late 2025. The Millicom transaction demonstrates one way in which we are carrying out the learnings from our strategic review of each market, increasing our scale in existing markets and establishing long-term relationships with the leading customers in those markets. In some markets, however we may conclude this type of opportunity is not available to us. In those cases, we will consider divesting markets where we are subscale. One example of this is in the Philippines. Our original strategy in the Philippines was to gain scale through build-to-suit arrangements with local carriers and continue to grow our portfolio through organic growth, smaller acquisitions and further builds. Unfortunately, over the past two years, the market has changed, with the leading carriers awarding large build-to-suit opportunities to tower companies as a component of significant sale-leaseback transactions with those tower companies at very high valuations. We have successfully built a valuable portfolio of tower assets in the Philippines. But today, there are over 30 independent tower companies in the market, and our market share is still less than 1%. Given our lack of broader presence in the region and a limited path to scale over the near to medium-term, we have begun a process to exit the market through a sale of our existing business. We will continue our strategic review of all of our operations and markets with a focus on stabilizing long-term cash flows and positioning ourselves to maximize organic growth opportunities in each market. Some markets may grow and others we may exit, but I am confident that each decision will strengthen SBA's prospects for the long-term. Pivoting now to our services business, we had a very good third quarter. Revenue was up over 23% from the second quarter and gross profit was up over 33%. Our carrier customers meaningfully stepped up their construction activity in the quarter, contributing to better results than we had anticipated. As a result, we have increased our full year outlook for services revenue from the outlook provided last quarter. And our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook also benefited from these strong results. Our services teams continue to execute very well, and they provide a true differentiation for SBA with our customers. During the third quarter, we also made significant progress in managing our balance sheet. With three very positive capital markets transactions, which Mark will discuss in a moment. These transactions demonstrate our access to attractively priced capital and our position as a preferred issuer across the debt markets in which we participate. Our leverage remains near historical lows. We have one debt maturity over the next two years, and our $2 billion revolver is fully undrawn. So we are in excellent shape in terms of capital structure and liquidity. In addition, we continue a targeted approach to capital allocation. Completing our recent refinancing, which provides us with flexibility to opportunistically allocate capital into strategic and value-enhancing asset investment, with a key example being the Millicom transaction. During the third quarter, we also acquired a portfolio of high cash flowing sites in the US, at an attractive price and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our asset base at appropriate valuations, as well as to opportunistically repurchase our stock. Our business continues to perform well, and our customers continue to enhance their networks. As a result, we are set up well for a strong finish to the year. Before turning it over to Mark to share more specifics on our third quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. Our operations teams deserve a special thank you for the tremendous job they did through the recent hurricanes affecting the Southeastern United States. Between the two storms, we had over 1,000 sites in the path of one or both storms. Our sites once again demonstrated their resiliency with relatively little structural damage. More impressive, though was the quick and dedicated response from our team members to assess the damage, clear access and assist our customers in getting their networks up and running as quickly as possible. I greatly appreciate the dedication and commitment of our teams on the ground in these challenging situations. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide additional details.\nMarc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Our third quarter results were mostly in-line with our expectations. Third quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.3% on a gross basis and 2% on a net basis, including 3.3% of churn. Of that 3.3%, 2% was related to Sprint consolidation. International or same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.1% net, including 4.3% of churn or 7.4% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see solid organic lease-up in our international market. Total international churn remained elevated in the third quarter to mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. Pro forma for today's announcement with Millicom, approximately 80% of cash site leasing revenue and 84% of adjusted EBITDA are expected to be denominated in US dollars. Let's now cover our results outlook for 2024. Even excluding the impact of better-than-expected foreign currency exchange rates in the third quarter, we increased our full year outlook across all key metrics, including site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and FFO per share as compared to our prior outlook. With regard to site development revenue, we increasing the full outlook by $5 million to mostly to strong third quarter outperformance in that business. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those which as of today or under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and AFFO per share now assume the recent ABS financing and repricing of our term loan B. Additionally, we enter into a new [forward starting] (ph) interest rate swaps starting in April 2025. It will have no impact on our 2024 outlook. We are quite busy with our balance sheet in the last 2 months. During the third quarter, the company issued, through an existing trust, 2 tranches of tower revenue securities totaling $2.07 billion. This includes a tranche of $620 million issued at 4.654% with an anticipated repayment rate of October 2027 and the final maturity date of October 2054. The also includes a tranche of $1.45 billion issued at 4.831% with an anticipated repayment date of October 2029 and a final maturity date of October 2054. The net proceeds from the offering we used to repay the $620 million total maturity and will be used to pay back the $1.165 billion ABS maturing in January of 2025. Cash proceeds to repay the January maturity will sit in an escrow account until then, at which time, the $1.165 billion will be repaid. Our next maturity is a $750 million ABS during January 2026. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark DeRussy: Thanks, Marc. In September, we repriced our $2.3 billion term loan by lowering the spread above one-month term SOFR from 200 basis points to 175 basis points. This improvement represents approximately $6 million of annual interest expense savings. In addition to lowering the spread on our term-loan by 25 basis points, we also further hedge the future floating rate component of the loan by entering into a forward-starting interest rate swap. This swap will fix the otherwise floating one-month term SOFR at 3% for a notional amount of $1 billion, significantly lower than today's current one-month term SOFR rate. Similar to the existing $1 billion forward-starting interest rate swap we entered into back in the fourth quarter of 2023. The new swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, and a maturity of April 11, 2028. Together, the blended one-month term SOFR rate, we will pay starting in March 2025 on $2 billion notional will be 3.45 -- excuse me, 3.15% and inclusive of the new spread of 175 basis points, the all-in cost for the $2 billion fixed portion of the $2.3 billion outstanding term loan will be 5.165%, starting in April of 2025. The remaining unhedged portion of the loan will continue to float and accrue interest at one month term SOFR, plus 175 basis points. Pro forma for the new swap, approximately 98% of our non-revolver debt outstanding is fixed, which will reduce the impact of future interest rate fluctuations and create greater certainty in our future AFFO. Our current leverage of 6.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 5.3 times. Pro forma for the ABS refinancing, our weighted average maturity is approximately four years with an average interest rate of 3.2% across our total outstanding debt. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, our $2 billion revolver is fully paid down. And finally, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.3 million or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on December 12, 2024, to shareholders of record, as of the close of business on November 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15%, over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2023. And operator, with that, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of -- excuse me, one moment. Batya Levi. Your line is open.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, domestically, you mentioned that carrier activity is increasing from the first half levels and shifting to more co-location versus amendment. Can you size that mix? And if this holds up into 4Q, how should we think generally about '25 leasing versus '24? Can it be flat to up? And on the Millicom deal, can you provide more color on the AFFO per share accretion in year one and maybe the lease-up opportunity on these sites? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. So on the carrier activity mix, we have seen an increase in carrier activity in the US in terms of new business signed up. The third quarter was higher than the first half of the year, really in the last three quarters, actually. And we would expect, based on the backlogs growing, that we'll continue to see that move up. It's not at levels of where it was during the height of a couple of years ago, but it's moving up in the right direction, and obviously that's favorable for the future. The mix of that shifting, we've begun to see, as I mentioned a little bit more of that revenue coming from new co-locations as opposed to amendments. We've had such a large percentage from amendments over time that now as we start to see more new leases, it's starting to shift a bit. And I guess what that really means is that we are obviously getting more points of presence with those carrier customers, which is a good thing for future growth as a big baseline. It does mean, I guess slightly on the negative side is that there is a little bit greater delay from when those leases, when that revenue gets signed up to when it commences, the amendments typically commence a little bit quicker. But if we continue to see something similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, we'll be in okay shape for next year, but I can't really comment on how it will look relative to this year. There's a lot of moving parts. So we'll see where we are when we get there. As it relates to the Millicom deal, I think it is a little premature for me to give you the exact AFFO accretion. I think you can look at the numbers that we released in our press release in terms of the Tower cash flow, it will be because we are in many of these markets, there will be limited overhead increases associated with that. In addition, I would expect we'll have some income tax implications, but it definitely will be accretive to AFFO per share once it closes. The issue is really just the timing of when it closes is so, as we get a little bit further down the road and we have a better sense of timing, we'll share that more specifically with you, Bob, yes. You asked one other question, too, which I don't think I answered, which is about the lease-up potential on those sites. The current tenancy ratio on those sites is [1.2%] (ph), with 1 being Millicom\u2019s leaseback, so they\u2019re fairly under-penetrated in terms of co-locations, so we think that actually will set them up pretty well to see some nice growth in the future.\nBatya Levi: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRic Prentiss: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Hey, I'm glad you all made it through the hurricane okay, got the network stack up and running as a Florida based firm. We feel you there. Glad everybody is doing well. I want to follow-up to Batya's questions on the [Tigo] (ph) deal. Can you help us understand kind of maybe a rough magnitude of EBITDA? I know you said it would be limited added overhead. Just trying to get that an understanding. It looks like the multiple on tower cash flow was about 11 times for the initial payment. Just trying to get a sense of what the EBITDA multiple might have been ballpark.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I would expect that the incremental SG&A will be between $3 million and $5 million, Ric. So maybe half a turn or so higher on a multiple.\nRic Prentiss: Yes. So still something kind of in the sub-6 times probably for EV, the EBITDA multiple paid for the assets?\nBrendan Cavanagh: No. It would be 11.\nRic Prentiss: Yes, right. [11.5%, so 12 like 11.5%] (ph)\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. So help us understand maybe a little bit more about why that price. Can you talk a little bit about the quality of the assets how robust are they as far as adding tenants? And then just what's the carrier universe like in each one of those markets and we can understand the leasing potential, given the multiple was kind of like [11.5 times] (ph)?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So Ric, first of all, we just kind of go to the overall premise, which I tried to lay out a little bit in my scripted comments, but we're operating throughout Central America today. We're one of the leading tower companies there. But as we kind of -- and I talked about this earlier in the year, as we kind of look through each of our markets and where we are operating, we -- tried to kind of say, what does the future look like? What's the potential look like for us? And we came pretty early on to the conclusion that you need to be a leader in the market in terms of your size and scale to be of the most relevance and importance of the carriers that operate there. And not only that, you needed to be aligned as closely as you could with the leading carriers in the markets so that you weren't as subject to some of the challenges that we faced when we've been indexed to maybe some of the weaker carriers in certain markets that we've been in, and it obviously has created churn and some disruption to the stability that this business is well known for. And so with that in mind, this was an opportunity to one, take a leadership position where we're clearly the largest, most dominant tower company across the region; and two to partner with the leading carrier across the region. So that was really the biggest driver. We could -- and the fact that we could do it at a price point that was good for us and good for Tigo, I think it worked very well. Obviously, it's a way for them to unlock value in assets that are not core to their operations. And for us, it's a way to make the most of our skill set, which is delivering these types of infrastructure assets at the highest quality and making them available not only to Tigo, but also to the other carriers in the region. Now when we look at the growth potential across the markets, we have a number of these markets, one of the good things about where we are today as we look forward is that many of them have already experienced the consolidation that kind of disrupted things for a little while over the last few years. And because of that, we feel very good about the remaining carriers in each of the markets. So, each one is a little bit different. Each country is a little different. Some only have two carriers that are fairly well balanced with Tigo being one. Others have more carriers than that. But the fact that there's only 1.2 tenants on these sites, and looking at where a number of them are located with Tigo as the leading provider in many of these markets, we believe it leaves a nice opportunity for some additional growth in the market.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And any CapEx that's required kind of to get them up to handle that additional tenancy.\nBrendan Cavanagh: There may be some, but that would obviously be figured into the analysis as we sign those leases with new carriers. So there is no required CapEx other than to the extent we see that it's appropriate in connection with the lease-up opportunity.\nRic Prentiss: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I guess first question would be relative to Millicom deal. Clearly, you're doubling down on the Central America footprint. What should we draw away from this in terms of anything you may say about or not about foreclosing the possibility of a larger out-of-footprint deal in Europe or elsewhere?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I don't think that it necessarily means anything as it related to that. Our top priority was certainly to look at the markets where we already are operating and to improve our position in those or, frankly to look at exiting those if we don't see a clear path to doing that. But that in and of itself isn't a commentary on expansion into other places. I think the expansion in other places is simply secondary to strengthening the position in the markets where we already are.\nJim Schneider: Understand. And then in terms of the commentary on greater proportion of new leasing on the domestic sites, can you maybe just talk a little bit about qualitatively how much of that is sort of new leases in, say rural markets and sort of outside of urban, suburban areas? And are you seeing anything on the margin in terms of densification?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I\u2019d say it's a little bit of both, Jim. I mean it's fairly early that we started to see this shift. We've really just seen an uptick in the sheer number of brand-new leases that we are signing relative to the pace we've seen over the last two years. So some of that is definitely in more rural markets as -- at least one of our customers has an initiative, regulatory requirement frankly, to build out some of those areas. So that's a part of it. But other parts of it are definitely densification as well in some of the more suburban markets. And I think it's our -- this is our best guess based on what we are seeing in the conversations we're having with our customers, but I expect both of those things to actually continue into the future, particularly given the lack of new spectrum that's going to be made available.\nJim Schneider: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrandon Nispel: Thanks for taking the question. Brandon, I'll try the leasing activity question a little bit away. I was hoping you could quantify the growth in lease applications in terms of the backlog of new leases that are signed but not commenced? And then Mark, just looking at the guide implied by 4Q leasing looks like something just shy of $9 million, is that the bottom? And when do you actually think there is an inflection in the leasing activity? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Brandon, I'm sorry to [hear this to you] (ph), but it was a little hard to hear you. I think you were asking about the organic growth and the timing of the inflection? Is it possible for you to just repeat it a little bit?\nBrandon Nispel: Yes. I can try again. I was hoping you to take the activity question a little different direction and hoping you could quantify the application backlog in terms of signed but not commenced new leases. And then just looking at 4Q implied by guidance seems like new leases domestically is just shy of $9 million. Is that correct? And when is the bottom for that leasing metrics? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the application backlog is of a similar shift in mix that we talked about. Your number for the fourth quarter is pretty close, I would say within $0.5 million or so of what we estimate. And on the timing of the bottom, I think that's around it. I can't tell you for sure yet as we get into next year, but I think we would expect to see that sort of represent right around the bottom area. I mean some of that is dependent upon what we continue to see happen here as we move through the balance of the year in terms of leasing activity. The other caveat to that, the reason I'm hedging a little bit is just that shift in the mix of the lease-up has some impact on timing. The two different things they're obviously related. One is what we sign up and two is when does it commence and hit the financials and that shift in the mix to some degree, can push it out a little bit further. So until we see how that plays out for the balance of the year, it's hard for me to say exactly. But we're seeing an uptick in the overall leasing activity. So I'm pretty confident we'll start to see it move upwards.\nBrandon Nispel : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Hi, thank you very much. Good evening. I want to come back to the Millicom deal. You did a an additional build-to-suit agreement with them. Could you just talk about how you think about underwriting that return on investment and so forth, and it's a seven-year deal. So is that ratable over that time period? And then I think leverage stayed in the sort of mid-6s. How are you thinking about where you want leverage to go over the next year or two as you balance M&A and buybacks and keeping flexibility on the balance sheet? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. So yes, the build-to-suit agreement was actually a piece of it that we're very excited about because it allows us to continue to expand our partnership with Millicom basically what it is as we are their exclusive provider of build-to-suit opportunities over the next seven years up to a total of 2,500 sites. We underwrote that with as we looked at what we expected the estimated costs and the pricing of it was tied into those estimated costs. We expect it to be a high returner, certainly north of double digits without any lease up. And again, we think that there will be plenty of opportunities to see second tenancies on a number of those sites as we add them over time because they're typically going in locations where there isn't any coverage today. So I think it will be certainly additive over time. In terms of the timing of it coming in over that seven years, there isn't an expected time frame. It may come in evenly over that or it may come in quicker. So we'll just we'll report that as it progresses. So there's no requirement in that regard. On the leverage front, yes, our leverage is still hovering around the lowest level that it's been at for us historically at 6.4 times. Even with the Millicom deal pro forma for that, that's a fairly small impact. You're talking about 0.2 turns is what I'd estimate of incremental leverage when that eventually closes. So I don't really have the desire to necessarily see the leverage go lower. It's really more a function of good places to use the excess capital that it generates. This deal is an example of an opportunity that we saw, that we thought would be very value enhancing. And so having that flexibility to do that is a nice place to be. And that leverage being lower allows us the opportunity to do that. But going forward, we'll continue to look for places where we can invest in assets. And if we don't see asset opportunities, we'll invest in share repurchases. And that if doesn't seem like the best spot at a given time, we'll obviously continue to pay down debt. But my preference is to do one of the first-two.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: Thank you. A couple of questions. So as you manage your Latin American portfolio, my recollection is that you had somewhat of a centralized model doing a lot of it out of Florida. And is that still the case now that you've got a couple of quarters under your belt as CEO? And does the Millicom transaction change that at all?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, John, it's basically still the same. And really, what it is, is the things that can be done centrally, we try to do centrally, meaning back-office functions, accounting, HR, legal, those types of things. We obviously have to have a presence, of course in the markets for operational purposes, for sales purposes, interactions with our customers. those sorts of things. And we do have local representation of these other functions there. But we try to have everything kind of funnel back through our core systems here and our teams here. And the reason we do that is, one, it's cost effective. But two, it gives us a much greater insight into what's happening across all of our international markets by having it run that way. And three, it also allows us to have consistency across all these various markets and the way that we operate and the way that we approach our business. And I think, over time, that has generally benefited us relative to our peers. So I don't expect to change that going forward. And even with this Millicom deal, we'll obviously have to have a few more people in the field and maybe one or two more here. But I think the general structure will stay the same.\nJon Atkin: And then a couple of US questions. Just wondering if you're seeing any kind of different impacts or activity from some of the build to relocate tower development activities as well as any impacts that you might expect to see in the industry with a Verizon portfolio sale changing hands into an independent operation.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We're not really seeing too much on the relo stuff anymore. It was a little bit hotter a couple of years ago, but is largely died down. We see very limited situations for that. I think most people have come to realize that building towers next to other towers is kind of await to mutually assured self-destruction in those particular situations. So we're seeing a lot less of that. In terms of the Verizon sale, yes, I mean there was a nice -- that was a nice sized portfolio here in the US, there's obviously very few portfolios of that size available in the U.S. market and it looks like it went for a very nice price, which I think is representative of the value of towers here in the US, and we think is supportive of the fact that SBA has a very high-quality, high-value platform and portfolio.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan.\nRichard Choe: Hi, I wanted to ask about the site development. The revenue picked up and the guidance was moved up slightly. Is that following that type of work following with the increase in co-location and new leases? Or is there something else going on there? And how should we think about it as we roll into next year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Richard, it is a little bit. We had actually a better quarter than we had anticipated when we gave guidance three months ago, which is why we're moving our outlook up for the year. And I would say a lot of that -- there's a couple of carrier customers that were particularly busy. And it does seem to be because of the shift to more new leases and the fact that actually, we're doing a lot more of the full term fee work than we used to. So there's a heavy construction component to it. That doing that heavy construction piece drives the total volume up even on the same number of agreements. So I do think that's one of the contributing factors. And I would expect, as we move into next year, we'd see the same types of drivers for it.\nRichard Choe: Great. And you talked a little bit about domestic M&A, but you did have a smaller deal that you said was highly cash flow accretive. Do you think there's more of these smaller deals to come and build upon? Or is that -- is it just a one-off type thing?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Unfortunately, I would say it's somewhat limited. We do our best to look at everything that's available and the volume of opportunities in the US is somewhat limited, which is part of the reason that they go for such high valuations because the folks chasing them outnumber the folks, making them available for sale. But Yes. I mean we're going to continue to look, and I think every so often, we're going to find opportunities to jump in and take advantage of something where maybe somebody else has missed it or we see value unlock opportunities that others don't. But I do think unfortunately, it's more limited than I would like.\nRichard Choe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt Niknam: Hi, guys thanks for taking the question. Just to dovetail on some of the questions that have been asked around the US. Can you talk maybe a little bit more around what necessarily changed in 3Q that drove the uptick in activity? Was it one carrier in particular or more broad-based? And then maybe just a follow on to that. On the DISH front, any changes in activity and any thoughts you can offer up on some of the moves they've made of late. Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, the change in the third quarter, I would say it's more broad-based. But in any given quarter, one carrier can be a little more active than another. So I don't know that as I kind of look at the pieces of it here in front of me, I don't see too much to highlight and we don't really like to get into the individual customers. I'm not sure that it would mean anything in anyway because the next quarter, that shift can turn around a little bit and just be a different carrier. It all depends on when they're hitting our specific sites, I think. With regard to DISH, obviously some positive news that I think sets us up well for the future, just the fact that one of our key customers, they have a lot to do. The fact they got some relief on the regulatory deadlines. I think it is clearly positive because it allows them to actually be able to achieve this build-out that they seem very, very committed to. And the funding that they've raised through the sale of satellite business, I think is also obviously positive. It's really just a question of timing. What they've done here is they've -- they've raised the funding, they've got themselves a schedule that they can work with, but I do think it will take some time for them to go through that and so it's a little early for me to know what the short-term impacts will be, but I do know long-term, it's obviously very positive.\nMatt Niknam: Great. If I could just throw one more follow-up. In terms of colo relative to amendment in the US, what's the mix now? And how does -- I mean because you mentioned more of a mix of colo, but I'm just curious, at least in the third quarter, what that mix was in the US.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. And this is based on dollars, but it was roughly 60%, a little over 60% from new leases.\nMatt Niknam: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nNick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, a couple of clarifications on Millicom. The Millicom press release highlighted the potential for them to get earnouts over time if you meet certain financial milestones. Are those likely -- would they need material to the purchase price? And from a churn perspective, is it fair to say that the 15-year MLA kind of locks Millicom in without any opportunity to get off any of the towers over time?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, on the second one. It's a 15-year committed term. On the first question on the earnout, there are some potential earn-outs for them. Those would only be paid if certain financial milestones were reached and that would be actually a great win for both parties. I don't think it materially will change the numbers, and it actually will be certainly enhancing to the overall multiple of the deal, if it happens.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Okay. And then you cited a deal with a nice yield on it that you closed. I think you're referencing the Televisa Univision deal. Can you share anything about the expected contribution there or the degree to which that thesis is based on the existing broadcast revenue stream versus potential lease-up? And how big is share of your business of broadcast today?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Broadcast is a fairly small percentage of our business. We have some existing embedded broadcast towers that we've had for a lot of years in our portfolio. This particular portfolio was something that we spent a number of months with them on looking at each site and what its potential was. Obviously, the price point is well below where the typical wireless towers are trading here in US. So that allows for a lot more flexibility in terms of what we needed to do from an organic growth standpoint. But we do think some of the sites have potential for some growth, but it doesn't really require much. And we have a long-term commitment from Univision on that leaseback.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Great, thanks Brendan.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. One moment please. And your line is open.\nEric Luebchow : Could you maybe touch on kind of how not you see non-Sprint churn in your domestic markets looking beyond this year? I think you've talked about getting that down to below 1% range. But any update on kind of timing to when you guys think you could get there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think that -- and guys are correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we were -- for this quarter, it's at about 1.3%, the non-Sprint churn. So it's already down into the lower ones. And I think it will probably improve from there. So I think that next year, I would expect that we're going to get somewhere close to 1% or so. So it continues to dwindle in terms of overall numbers and impact.\nEric Luebchow : Got you. Good to hear. And then just a follow-up on the Millicom MLA. You noted it's mostly US dollar-denominated, but any kind of color you can provide on kind of the escalator structure whether are those fixed? And are the new leases with more comprehensive or holistic in nature? Or will that growth be more subject to their kind of future activity levels, just kind of comparing it with what we typically see in the US. Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I can't get into too much detail on all the -- first of all, on the dollar piece, the MLA is 100% US dollars, are referenced to significantly all the cash flow has to do with a few other small oddball things mostly around expenses. But the MLA is all in US dollars. And it's got all of the typical things you would see there are escalators in it, but I'd rather not get into all the detailed structure on that, if I can avoid it.\nEric Luebchow : Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed Partners.\nWalter Piecyk: Can you just refresh my memory on how long it does take from order to implementation for colo? I know you said it obviously takes longer than amendment, but just kind of a ballpark number of months.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I'd say ballpark, six months, Walt.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. So if the order flow is kicking in now, but obviously, that revenue should kick in in conjunction with the capital plans for these operators in 2025. And then on the dividend, obviously, you stated what you're doing in the fourth quarter. Last year, the growth was 20% this year. It's -- it was 15% it sounds like the outlook in terms of growth might be a bit better, maybe not. But is the expectation to -- when you look at the investor base out there that's available to you on the yield side. Is there kind of like a floor that you think about in terms of growth in the dividend year-over-year as we contemplate '25 and '26?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Not explicitly. I would expect that we will be certainly the fastest-growing dividends within our small industry here. And one of the fastest among REITs broadly. It is 15% this year, which is the lowest it's been actually at any point in our history. Obviously, we're starting with relatively small numbers, so the percentage growth can be higher. Part of it, Walt is that we're triangulating a little bit towards our REIT obligation. We have NOLs that we've been burning off. And so we've been able to use those as kind of a supplement to limit us from having to pay the full REIT dividend. But as we burn those NOLs, that starts to kind of lock in more and more what our number needs to be. But I would expect -- I don't really want to jump ahead because we are going to look at our dividend increase next quarter that we typically do it with our fourth quarter earnings. But I would expect it will still be a very healthy growth relative to the rest of the industry.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And apologies to ask when tower companies do something new and exciting, we have to ask about it. So I'll have to ask about the Millicom deal. Brendan, the Millicom, I think, is operating in nine markets in Central America and you guys bought, I think, 5. Is there some sort of potential that there's something more that's going to evolve out of that? Or can you explain a little bit more about why you bought -- what you bought and didn't buy what you didn't buy. And then I guess another question for the Marks is, if I'm kind of reading this right, you've kind of swung from a worldview where having a 15% to 20% variable rate debt portfolio was the right mix. Now you're 98% of non-revolver is fixed. Can you talk a little bit about why you chose now to make that decision? And you had a lot of activity in the quarter. A lot of it had to do with the $2.3 billion term-loan expiring in 2025. Are there more moves to make? Or is this kind of the balance sheet that SBA is going to have for the next 12, 24 months that we can come just kind of chew on and put into our models? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: So on the Millicom markets, We -- I believe, bought every market that they operate in, in Central America. I think when you're referring to their extra markets, you're including South American markets, David. And so what we focused on is the places where we had operations and frankly, where we have a good size presence and this was a meaningful enough transaction to put us in a much stronger go-forward position. Some of the markets where they operate, we are not currently in some of those markets and others were well below scale and it didn't really seem like it was going to change things. And it was actually a much cleaner separation to Central America versus South America. There's nothing that you should read into that in terms of future additional items. This was one specific deal and it stands on its own merits. And then your other question on the debt, which Mark you can take if you want, but I don't think there's any change, though, in our philosophy. As you mentioned the fixed versus floating, as though it was a change. We actually already had hedges in place for the vast majority of our floating debt. Sometimes it changes because of the amounts outstanding on the revolver, which is obviously floating. And part of the reason is 98% is because there's zero outstanding on the revolver. But we already have most of our term-loan, which is the other floating instrument fixed today through hedges. And what we've done is enter into some forward starting hedges to continue that fixing to provide some certainty. And we did that more to be opportunistic around the rate environment that we saw locking in rates that were materially below where the rates are today will require significant reductions in rates. And so it's really to provide the certainty but also to take advantage of what we thought were actually pretty good rates. I don't know Mark, do you want to add anything?\nMarc Montagner: No, I think the existing hedge on the term loan for $1.95 billion expires in April of 2025. So we just put -- two new hedges in place $1 billion each one a few months ago at 3.8%. And another one on the cap at 3% that we did last month. So the average -- or the max interest rate on SOFR now for the $2 billion of the term loan B would be 3.41%, and SOFR is at 4.7% now. So I think we just took advantage of a debt in interest rate to locking a cap on the max interest rate we're going to pay on the term loan B, starting in April of '25.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean they're really just replacements of what existed when they're set to expire. And I think going forward, you asked a question about whether the balance sheet looks the same here for the next 12 months or so, I mean we only have one maturity during the next 24 months, and that's in January of 2026. And frankly, it's only $750 million, which is really not that much can be managed in many different ways. So I think the answer to that question is yes, David. It's going to stay very much similar to what you see today. The only caveat to that is other opportunities that come along that will require some shift in the way we're capitalized to take advantage of them. But otherwise, you should expect it would be the same.\nDavid Barden : Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Mike Rollins with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two, if I could. First, as you're seeing more opportunity and leasing from your carrier customers does that increase the likelihood that you would enter into new multiyear comprehensive deals with additional domestic national wireless carriers. And then second, philosophically, how are you looking at updating escalators in the domestic business when you have renewal opportunities with your customers? Do you still prefer a fixed long-term rate? Or just given some questions of inflation and future rates, are you considering taking a CPI-based approach with possible floors and ceilings? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So -- we have -- as you know, we already have a comprehensive MLA that we signed with AT&T about 15 months or so ago. So that is already set in place and isn't really impacted by what's happening. Now I think as we have continuing the conversations with our other customers, if we can find a way to agree on things that work for both parties that our comprehensive nature, we're open to doing that. In either case, I would expect us to have, what I'll call, regular MLAs, meaning things that define the overall merits of the relationship, they don't necessarily have to be the all-you-can-eat structure. That really just depends on if it's something that works for what their needs are in the short term and what we think is the best way to monetize value. So I don't really know. Honestly, Mike. We'll continue to talk to our customers and whatever structure works the best for both parties is what we'll go with, but we don't have a disposition towards trying to do more of those. In terms of the escalators, they don't really change much because even when we negotiate new agreements sometimes, we'll look at what the escalator will be for the brand new co-locations that they sign. We don't touch the ones that are in the embedded base, and that's obviously the bulk of our business. So there's little impact on the base escalators. For the new ones, we will discuss it, but we usually end up focusing on a fixed rate as opposed to a CPI. But really that's a matter of just negotiation on each individual case.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick ones on Millicom. The first release alluded to 7,000 communication sites. Can you talk about the mix of towers versus rooftops? And then also on the tenancy ratio being [1.2] (ph). Can you talk about whether Millicom was pursuing a strategy of co-location or perhaps they were trying to avoid, leasing to some of their competitors to maintain a competitive advantage in some of these areas?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. So the vast majority of these are towers and even the ones that are rooftops, which is a fairly small percentage are typically towers on rooftops. So it's basically all effectively towers. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. I think it's somewhere around 90% is ground-based towers and the other 10% to 12% or so is rooftop based. And then on the tenancy side, the Millicom did have these in a -- they had established a tower company entity that they called [LOGI] (ph) . That's where these towers resided. And the intention was to lease space on them to other parties with so they did do some, efforts around that. However, it's our belief that a number of these sites were held back because they were better sites and therefore, for competitive reasons for the wireless business. They did not make them available. And even in other cases, competing carriers, we're not as inclined to go on the sites when they're owned by one of their competitors. So we do think there's an opportunity to unlock lease-up value here.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street Advisors.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. I just want to go back to that earlier question about the earn-out because it's really helpful for figuring out the valuation you paid. So I know in your SEC filings, you disclosed potential obligations on prior transactions, but those don't end up being shown up on your balance sheet. So I guess as we kind of think about when the deal closes, should we assume that line item in your queue is going to increase materially? Or is the earnout not that material? And then also just an idea of the time frame for when those earnouts would be payable? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I don't think it is going to change on our balance sheet. There may be some disclosure around potential earn-outs, but honestly David, the deal was just signed today, so I'm not 100% sure what the disclosure will look like in our financials, but we'll -- that's something that maybe our guys could look at that and just give with you off off-line on that. In any case, it's not that material to the overall picture. So I think even if you see what it might look like, I don't think it's going to -- it's not going to change the way that the deal looks. And as I said, to the extent that anything is paid, it will actually be a success because it means that we've added more revenue than perhaps we even expected.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nBrendan Cavanagh: Colin, I think we're probably ready \u2013 I think we\u2019ve already used up our allotted time. So I just want to thank everybody for joining the call, and we look forward to catching up with you next quarter to share our year-end results.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marc Montagner",
            "content": "Thank you, Brendan. Our third quarter results were mostly in-line with our expectations. Third quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.3% on a gross basis and 2% on a net basis, including 3.3% of churn. Of that 3.3%, 2% was related to Sprint consolidation. International or same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.1% net, including 4.3% of churn or 7.4% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see solid organic lease-up in our international market. Total international churn remained elevated in the third quarter to mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. Pro forma for today's announcement with Millicom, approximately 80% of cash site leasing revenue and 84% of adjusted EBITDA are expected to be denominated in US dollars. Let's now cover our results outlook for 2024. Even excluding the impact of better-than-expected foreign currency exchange rates in the third quarter, we increased our full year outlook across all key metrics, including site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and FFO per share as compared to our prior outlook. With regard to site development revenue, we increasing the full outlook by $5 million to mostly to strong third quarter outperformance in that business. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those which as of today or under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and AFFO per share now assume the recent ABS financing and repricing of our term loan B. Additionally, we enter into a new [forward starting] (ph) interest rate swaps starting in April 2025. It will have no impact on our 2024 outlook. We are quite busy with our balance sheet in the last 2 months. During the third quarter, the company issued, through an existing trust, 2 tranches of tower revenue securities totaling $2.07 billion. This includes a tranche of $620 million issued at 4.654% with an anticipated repayment rate of October 2027 and the final maturity date of October 2054. The also includes a tranche of $1.45 billion issued at 4.831% with an anticipated repayment date of October 2029 and a final maturity date of October 2054. The net proceeds from the offering we used to repay the $620 million total maturity and will be used to pay back the $1.165 billion ABS maturing in January of 2025. Cash proceeds to repay the January maturity will sit in an escrow account until then, at which time, the $1.165 billion will be repaid. Our next maturity is a $750 million ABS during January 2026. Let me now turn the call over to Mark. No, I think the existing hedge on the term loan for $1.95 billion expires in April of 2025. So we just put -- two new hedges in place $1 billion each one a few months ago at 3.8%. And another one on the cap at 3% that we did last month. So the average -- or the max interest rate on SOFR now for the $2 billion of the term loan B would be 3.41%, and SOFR is at 4.7% now. So I think we just took advantage of a debt in interest rate to locking a cap on the max interest rate we're going to pay on the term loan B, starting in April of '25."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. Operationally, the third quarter ended up rolling out largely as we expected, with leasing results in-line with our outlook and services results a little ahead of our outlook. Foreign exchange rates were a little stronger than our estimates a quarter ago, and domestic new carrier activity was up from the first half of the new year. All of these items combined to allow us to increase our full year 2024 outlook across all of our key financial metrics. In the US, new business executions were up from the prior three quarters. And applications and inquiries have increased as well. We are beginning to see a shift in the makeup of our new business signed up and applications with a growing percentage coming from new lease [co-locations] (ph) versus amendments to existing leases. We anticipate this trend continuing into 2025. All of our major customers have significant network needs over the next few years as mobile network consumption continues to grow at a healthy pace. The limitation of new spectrum availability over the next several years will challenge our customers to meet the demands on their networks through incremental equipment deployment and densification of sites. Our macro tower portfolio should be a beneficiary of this dynamic. Other growth drivers, which we have discussed before, such as fixed wireless access, the incorporation of new generative AI capabilities into handsets, regulatory build-out commitments and remaining 5G coverage expansion will all contribute to a healthy network investment environment over the next several years. In addition, our customer relationships are strong. We are a trusted and valued partner to each of them. We are very focused on helping them to achieve their objectives through providing exceptional service and quality. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change much from quarter-to-quarter, but consistently delivering over time, as we have done for the past 35 years, is the best way to be our customers' first choice provider and ultimately, to maximize growth for our shareholders. Internationally, we have adopted the same philosophy. And as a result, we are seen as a valued partner to our carrier customers in each of our largest markets. The quarter was solid with international leasing results in-line with our expectations, and we expect a solid finish to the year. The broader market internationally though, still presents some challenges as we manage through customer consolidations and network rationalization. However, we see light at the end of this tunnel as the surviving customers are stronger and better positioned to invest in growing their wireless product offerings and their ARPUs. To accomplish this, increased network investment will be required, 5G upgrades across all of our international markets are really just at the very beginning. And wireless broadband consumption is growing across our markets just as fast, if not faster, than the US. Overall, we believe our International business will continue to be additive to our organic growth profile over time and the long-term prospects are still very good. As part of maximizing the long-term prospects of our International business, we continue to strategically review our operations and future potential in each of our existing markets. As I have shared with you before, we believe that in order to create the longest -- the greatest -- excuse me, long-term stability and the opportunity to maximize growth in a particular market, it is important to be of scale and positioned as an industry leader in that market and to be closely aligned with the leading wireless carriers in the market as well. In alignment with that effort, we are very pleased to share with you today's announcement of a purchase agreement signed with Millicom International Cellular, for the acquisition of over 7,000 sites throughout Central America, for an initial cash purchase price of approximately $975 million. Pro forma for this transaction, SBA will be the largest tower company across the region. We are very excited to increase our partnership with Millicom and to help them grow their business for many years to come. The assets are located across five countries in Central America, increasing SBA scale in four of those countries where we already have operations. The assets are anticipated to produce approximately $129 million in site leasing revenue and $89 million in tower cash flow during the first full year of operations after closing. And significantly all of the cash flow will be denominated in US dollars. Millicom will be a tenant on each site under a leaseback arrangement in which they have committed to an initial 15-year term. In addition, as part of the leasing arrangement, Millicom has agreed to extend all of their approximately 1,500 existing leases with SBA that exist on our existing assets in the region for a new 15-year term. SBA and Millicom have also entered into a new build-to-suit agreement under which SBA will exclusively build up to 2,500 new sites in Central America for Millicom over the next seven years. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and we expect it will close sometime in mid- to late 2025. The Millicom transaction demonstrates one way in which we are carrying out the learnings from our strategic review of each market, increasing our scale in existing markets and establishing long-term relationships with the leading customers in those markets. In some markets, however we may conclude this type of opportunity is not available to us. In those cases, we will consider divesting markets where we are subscale. One example of this is in the Philippines. Our original strategy in the Philippines was to gain scale through build-to-suit arrangements with local carriers and continue to grow our portfolio through organic growth, smaller acquisitions and further builds. Unfortunately, over the past two years, the market has changed, with the leading carriers awarding large build-to-suit opportunities to tower companies as a component of significant sale-leaseback transactions with those tower companies at very high valuations. We have successfully built a valuable portfolio of tower assets in the Philippines. But today, there are over 30 independent tower companies in the market, and our market share is still less than 1%. Given our lack of broader presence in the region and a limited path to scale over the near to medium-term, we have begun a process to exit the market through a sale of our existing business. We will continue our strategic review of all of our operations and markets with a focus on stabilizing long-term cash flows and positioning ourselves to maximize organic growth opportunities in each market. Some markets may grow and others we may exit, but I am confident that each decision will strengthen SBA's prospects for the long-term. Pivoting now to our services business, we had a very good third quarter. Revenue was up over 23% from the second quarter and gross profit was up over 33%. Our carrier customers meaningfully stepped up their construction activity in the quarter, contributing to better results than we had anticipated. As a result, we have increased our full year outlook for services revenue from the outlook provided last quarter. And our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook also benefited from these strong results. Our services teams continue to execute very well, and they provide a true differentiation for SBA with our customers. During the third quarter, we also made significant progress in managing our balance sheet. With three very positive capital markets transactions, which Mark will discuss in a moment. These transactions demonstrate our access to attractively priced capital and our position as a preferred issuer across the debt markets in which we participate. Our leverage remains near historical lows. We have one debt maturity over the next two years, and our $2 billion revolver is fully undrawn. So we are in excellent shape in terms of capital structure and liquidity. In addition, we continue a targeted approach to capital allocation. Completing our recent refinancing, which provides us with flexibility to opportunistically allocate capital into strategic and value-enhancing asset investment, with a key example being the Millicom transaction. During the third quarter, we also acquired a portfolio of high cash flowing sites in the US, at an attractive price and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our asset base at appropriate valuations, as well as to opportunistically repurchase our stock. Our business continues to perform well, and our customers continue to enhance their networks. As a result, we are set up well for a strong finish to the year. Before turning it over to Mark to share more specifics on our third quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. Our operations teams deserve a special thank you for the tremendous job they did through the recent hurricanes affecting the Southeastern United States. Between the two storms, we had over 1,000 sites in the path of one or both storms. Our sites once again demonstrated their resiliency with relatively little structural damage. More impressive, though was the quick and dedicated response from our team members to assess the damage, clear access and assist our customers in getting their networks up and running as quickly as possible. I greatly appreciate the dedication and commitment of our teams on the ground in these challenging situations. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark who will provide additional details. Sure. So on the carrier activity mix, we have seen an increase in carrier activity in the US in terms of new business signed up. The third quarter was higher than the first half of the year, really in the last three quarters, actually. And we would expect, based on the backlogs growing, that we'll continue to see that move up. It's not at levels of where it was during the height of a couple of years ago, but it's moving up in the right direction, and obviously that's favorable for the future. The mix of that shifting, we've begun to see, as I mentioned a little bit more of that revenue coming from new co-locations as opposed to amendments. We've had such a large percentage from amendments over time that now as we start to see more new leases, it's starting to shift a bit. And I guess what that really means is that we are obviously getting more points of presence with those carrier customers, which is a good thing for future growth as a big baseline. It does mean, I guess slightly on the negative side is that there is a little bit greater delay from when those leases, when that revenue gets signed up to when it commences, the amendments typically commence a little bit quicker. But if we continue to see something similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, we'll be in okay shape for next year, but I can't really comment on how it will look relative to this year. There's a lot of moving parts. So we'll see where we are when we get there. As it relates to the Millicom deal, I think it is a little premature for me to give you the exact AFFO accretion. I think you can look at the numbers that we released in our press release in terms of the Tower cash flow, it will be because we are in many of these markets, there will be limited overhead increases associated with that. In addition, I would expect we'll have some income tax implications, but it definitely will be accretive to AFFO per share once it closes. The issue is really just the timing of when it closes is so, as we get a little bit further down the road and we have a better sense of timing, we'll share that more specifically with you, Bob, yes. You asked one other question, too, which I don't think I answered, which is about the lease-up potential on those sites. The current tenancy ratio on those sites is [1.2%] (ph), with 1 being Millicom's leaseback, so they're fairly under-penetrated in terms of co-locations, so we think that actually will set them up pretty well to see some nice growth in the future. Yes, I would expect that the incremental SG&A will be between $3 million and $5 million, Ric. So maybe half a turn or so higher on a multiple. No. It would be 11. Yes. Yes. So Ric, first of all, we just kind of go to the overall premise, which I tried to lay out a little bit in my scripted comments, but we're operating throughout Central America today. We're one of the leading tower companies there. But as we kind of -- and I talked about this earlier in the year, as we kind of look through each of our markets and where we are operating, we -- tried to kind of say, what does the future look like? What's the potential look like for us? And we came pretty early on to the conclusion that you need to be a leader in the market in terms of your size and scale to be of the most relevance and importance of the carriers that operate there. And not only that, you needed to be aligned as closely as you could with the leading carriers in the markets so that you weren't as subject to some of the challenges that we faced when we've been indexed to maybe some of the weaker carriers in certain markets that we've been in, and it obviously has created churn and some disruption to the stability that this business is well known for. And so with that in mind, this was an opportunity to one, take a leadership position where we're clearly the largest, most dominant tower company across the region; and two to partner with the leading carrier across the region. So that was really the biggest driver. We could -- and the fact that we could do it at a price point that was good for us and good for Tigo, I think it worked very well. Obviously, it's a way for them to unlock value in assets that are not core to their operations. And for us, it's a way to make the most of our skill set, which is delivering these types of infrastructure assets at the highest quality and making them available not only to Tigo, but also to the other carriers in the region. Now when we look at the growth potential across the markets, we have a number of these markets, one of the good things about where we are today as we look forward is that many of them have already experienced the consolidation that kind of disrupted things for a little while over the last few years. And because of that, we feel very good about the remaining carriers in each of the markets. So, each one is a little bit different. Each country is a little different. Some only have two carriers that are fairly well balanced with Tigo being one. Others have more carriers than that. But the fact that there's only 1.2 tenants on these sites, and looking at where a number of them are located with Tigo as the leading provider in many of these markets, we believe it leaves a nice opportunity for some additional growth in the market. There may be some, but that would obviously be figured into the analysis as we sign those leases with new carriers. So there is no required CapEx other than to the extent we see that it's appropriate in connection with the lease-up opportunity. I don't think that it necessarily means anything as it related to that. Our top priority was certainly to look at the markets where we already are operating and to improve our position in those or, frankly to look at exiting those if we don't see a clear path to doing that. But that in and of itself isn't a commentary on expansion into other places. I think the expansion in other places is simply secondary to strengthening the position in the markets where we already are. Yes. I'd say it's a little bit of both, Jim. I mean it's fairly early that we started to see this shift. We've really just seen an uptick in the sheer number of brand-new leases that we are signing relative to the pace we've seen over the last two years. So some of that is definitely in more rural markets as -- at least one of our customers has an initiative, regulatory requirement frankly, to build out some of those areas. So that's a part of it. But other parts of it are definitely densification as well in some of the more suburban markets. And I think it's our -- this is our best guess based on what we are seeing in the conversations we're having with our customers, but I expect both of those things to actually continue into the future, particularly given the lack of new spectrum that's going to be made available. Yes, Brandon, I'm sorry to [hear this to you] (ph), but it was a little hard to hear you. I think you were asking about the organic growth and the timing of the inflection? Is it possible for you to just repeat it a little bit? Yes. So the application backlog is of a similar shift in mix that we talked about. Your number for the fourth quarter is pretty close, I would say within $0.5 million or so of what we estimate. And on the timing of the bottom, I think that's around it. I can't tell you for sure yet as we get into next year, but I think we would expect to see that sort of represent right around the bottom area. I mean some of that is dependent upon what we continue to see happen here as we move through the balance of the year in terms of leasing activity. The other caveat to that, the reason I'm hedging a little bit is just that shift in the mix of the lease-up has some impact on timing. The two different things they're obviously related. One is what we sign up and two is when does it commence and hit the financials and that shift in the mix to some degree, can push it out a little bit further. So until we see how that plays out for the balance of the year, it's hard for me to say exactly. But we're seeing an uptick in the overall leasing activity. So I'm pretty confident we'll start to see it move upwards. Sure. So yes, the build-to-suit agreement was actually a piece of it that we're very excited about because it allows us to continue to expand our partnership with Millicom basically what it is as we are their exclusive provider of build-to-suit opportunities over the next seven years up to a total of 2,500 sites. We underwrote that with as we looked at what we expected the estimated costs and the pricing of it was tied into those estimated costs. We expect it to be a high returner, certainly north of double digits without any lease up. And again, we think that there will be plenty of opportunities to see second tenancies on a number of those sites as we add them over time because they're typically going in locations where there isn't any coverage today. So I think it will be certainly additive over time. In terms of the timing of it coming in over that seven years, there isn't an expected time frame. It may come in evenly over that or it may come in quicker. So we'll just we'll report that as it progresses. So there's no requirement in that regard. On the leverage front, yes, our leverage is still hovering around the lowest level that it's been at for us historically at 6.4 times. Even with the Millicom deal pro forma for that, that's a fairly small impact. You're talking about 0.2 turns is what I'd estimate of incremental leverage when that eventually closes. So I don't really have the desire to necessarily see the leverage go lower. It's really more a function of good places to use the excess capital that it generates. This deal is an example of an opportunity that we saw, that we thought would be very value enhancing. And so having that flexibility to do that is a nice place to be. And that leverage being lower allows us the opportunity to do that. But going forward, we'll continue to look for places where we can invest in assets. And if we don't see asset opportunities, we'll invest in share repurchases. And that if doesn't seem like the best spot at a given time, we'll obviously continue to pay down debt. But my preference is to do one of the first-two. Yes, John, it's basically still the same. And really, what it is, is the things that can be done centrally, we try to do centrally, meaning back-office functions, accounting, HR, legal, those types of things. We obviously have to have a presence, of course in the markets for operational purposes, for sales purposes, interactions with our customers. those sorts of things. And we do have local representation of these other functions there. But we try to have everything kind of funnel back through our core systems here and our teams here. And the reason we do that is, one, it's cost effective. But two, it gives us a much greater insight into what's happening across all of our international markets by having it run that way. And three, it also allows us to have consistency across all these various markets and the way that we operate and the way that we approach our business. And I think, over time, that has generally benefited us relative to our peers. So I don't expect to change that going forward. And even with this Millicom deal, we'll obviously have to have a few more people in the field and maybe one or two more here. But I think the general structure will stay the same. Yes. We're not really seeing too much on the relo stuff anymore. It was a little bit hotter a couple of years ago, but is largely died down. We see very limited situations for that. I think most people have come to realize that building towers next to other towers is kind of await to mutually assured self-destruction in those particular situations. So we're seeing a lot less of that. In terms of the Verizon sale, yes, I mean there was a nice -- that was a nice sized portfolio here in the US, there's obviously very few portfolios of that size available in the U.S. market and it looks like it went for a very nice price, which I think is representative of the value of towers here in the US, and we think is supportive of the fact that SBA has a very high-quality, high-value platform and portfolio. Yes, Richard, it is a little bit. We had actually a better quarter than we had anticipated when we gave guidance three months ago, which is why we're moving our outlook up for the year. And I would say a lot of that -- there's a couple of carrier customers that were particularly busy. And it does seem to be because of the shift to more new leases and the fact that actually, we're doing a lot more of the full term fee work than we used to. So there's a heavy construction component to it. That doing that heavy construction piece drives the total volume up even on the same number of agreements. So I do think that's one of the contributing factors. And I would expect, as we move into next year, we'd see the same types of drivers for it. Yes. Unfortunately, I would say it's somewhat limited. We do our best to look at everything that's available and the volume of opportunities in the US is somewhat limited, which is part of the reason that they go for such high valuations because the folks chasing them outnumber the folks, making them available for sale. But Yes. I mean we're going to continue to look, and I think every so often, we're going to find opportunities to jump in and take advantage of something where maybe somebody else has missed it or we see value unlock opportunities that others don't. But I do think unfortunately, it's more limited than I would like. Yes, the change in the third quarter, I would say it's more broad-based. But in any given quarter, one carrier can be a little more active than another. So I don't know that as I kind of look at the pieces of it here in front of me, I don't see too much to highlight and we don't really like to get into the individual customers. I'm not sure that it would mean anything in anyway because the next quarter, that shift can turn around a little bit and just be a different carrier. It all depends on when they're hitting our specific sites, I think. With regard to DISH, obviously some positive news that I think sets us up well for the future, just the fact that one of our key customers, they have a lot to do. The fact they got some relief on the regulatory deadlines. I think it is clearly positive because it allows them to actually be able to achieve this build-out that they seem very, very committed to. And the funding that they've raised through the sale of satellite business, I think is also obviously positive. It's really just a question of timing. What they've done here is they've -- they've raised the funding, they've got themselves a schedule that they can work with, but I do think it will take some time for them to go through that and so it's a little early for me to know what the short-term impacts will be, but I do know long-term, it's obviously very positive. Yes. And this is based on dollars, but it was roughly 60%, a little over 60% from new leases. Yes, on the second one. It's a 15-year committed term. On the first question on the earnout, there are some potential earn-outs for them. Those would only be paid if certain financial milestones were reached and that would be actually a great win for both parties. I don't think it materially will change the numbers, and it actually will be certainly enhancing to the overall multiple of the deal, if it happens. Broadcast is a fairly small percentage of our business. We have some existing embedded broadcast towers that we've had for a lot of years in our portfolio. This particular portfolio was something that we spent a number of months with them on looking at each site and what its potential was. Obviously, the price point is well below where the typical wireless towers are trading here in US. So that allows for a lot more flexibility in terms of what we needed to do from an organic growth standpoint. But we do think some of the sites have potential for some growth, but it doesn't really require much. And we have a long-term commitment from Univision on that leaseback. Yes. I think that -- and guys are correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we were -- for this quarter, it's at about 1.3%, the non-Sprint churn. So it's already down into the lower ones. And I think it will probably improve from there. So I think that next year, I would expect that we're going to get somewhere close to 1% or so. So it continues to dwindle in terms of overall numbers and impact. Yes. I can't get into too much detail on all the -- first of all, on the dollar piece, the MLA is 100% US dollars, are referenced to significantly all the cash flow has to do with a few other small oddball things mostly around expenses. But the MLA is all in US dollars. And it's got all of the typical things you would see there are escalators in it, but I'd rather not get into all the detailed structure on that, if I can avoid it. Yes, I'd say ballpark, six months, Walt. Not explicitly. I would expect that we will be certainly the fastest-growing dividends within our small industry here. And one of the fastest among REITs broadly. It is 15% this year, which is the lowest it's been actually at any point in our history. Obviously, we're starting with relatively small numbers, so the percentage growth can be higher. Part of it, Walt is that we're triangulating a little bit towards our REIT obligation. We have NOLs that we've been burning off. And so we've been able to use those as kind of a supplement to limit us from having to pay the full REIT dividend. But as we burn those NOLs, that starts to kind of lock in more and more what our number needs to be. But I would expect -- I don't really want to jump ahead because we are going to look at our dividend increase next quarter that we typically do it with our fourth quarter earnings. But I would expect it will still be a very healthy growth relative to the rest of the industry. So on the Millicom markets, We -- I believe, bought every market that they operate in, in Central America. I think when you're referring to their extra markets, you're including South American markets, David. And so what we focused on is the places where we had operations and frankly, where we have a good size presence and this was a meaningful enough transaction to put us in a much stronger go-forward position. Some of the markets where they operate, we are not currently in some of those markets and others were well below scale and it didn't really seem like it was going to change things. And it was actually a much cleaner separation to Central America versus South America. There's nothing that you should read into that in terms of future additional items. This was one specific deal and it stands on its own merits. And then your other question on the debt, which Mark you can take if you want, but I don't think there's any change, though, in our philosophy. As you mentioned the fixed versus floating, as though it was a change. We actually already had hedges in place for the vast majority of our floating debt. Sometimes it changes because of the amounts outstanding on the revolver, which is obviously floating. And part of the reason is 98% is because there's zero outstanding on the revolver. But we already have most of our term-loan, which is the other floating instrument fixed today through hedges. And what we've done is enter into some forward starting hedges to continue that fixing to provide some certainty. And we did that more to be opportunistic around the rate environment that we saw locking in rates that were materially below where the rates are today will require significant reductions in rates. And so it's really to provide the certainty but also to take advantage of what we thought were actually pretty good rates. I don't know Mark, do you want to add anything? Yes. I mean they're really just replacements of what existed when they're set to expire. And I think going forward, you asked a question about whether the balance sheet looks the same here for the next 12 months or so, I mean we only have one maturity during the next 24 months, and that's in January of 2026. And frankly, it's only $750 million, which is really not that much can be managed in many different ways. So I think the answer to that question is yes, David. It's going to stay very much similar to what you see today. The only caveat to that is other opportunities that come along that will require some shift in the way we're capitalized to take advantage of them. But otherwise, you should expect it would be the same. Yes. So -- we have -- as you know, we already have a comprehensive MLA that we signed with AT&T about 15 months or so ago. So that is already set in place and isn't really impacted by what's happening. Now I think as we have continuing the conversations with our other customers, if we can find a way to agree on things that work for both parties that our comprehensive nature, we're open to doing that. In either case, I would expect us to have, what I'll call, regular MLAs, meaning things that define the overall merits of the relationship, they don't necessarily have to be the all-you-can-eat structure. That really just depends on if it's something that works for what their needs are in the short term and what we think is the best way to monetize value. So I don't really know. Honestly, Mike. We'll continue to talk to our customers and whatever structure works the best for both parties is what we'll go with, but we don't have a disposition towards trying to do more of those. In terms of the escalators, they don't really change much because even when we negotiate new agreements sometimes, we'll look at what the escalator will be for the brand new co-locations that they sign. We don't touch the ones that are in the embedded base, and that's obviously the bulk of our business. So there's little impact on the base escalators. For the new ones, we will discuss it, but we usually end up focusing on a fixed rate as opposed to a CPI. But really that's a matter of just negotiation on each individual case. Yes. So the vast majority of these are towers and even the ones that are rooftops, which is a fairly small percentage are typically towers on rooftops. So it's basically all effectively towers. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. I think it's somewhere around 90% is ground-based towers and the other 10% to 12% or so is rooftop based. And then on the tenancy side, the Millicom did have these in a -- they had established a tower company entity that they called [LOGI] (ph) . That's where these towers resided. And the intention was to lease space on them to other parties with so they did do some, efforts around that. However, it's our belief that a number of these sites were held back because they were better sites and therefore, for competitive reasons for the wireless business. They did not make them available. And even in other cases, competing carriers, we're not as inclined to go on the sites when they're owned by one of their competitors. So we do think there's an opportunity to unlock lease-up value here. Yes. I don't think it is going to change on our balance sheet. There may be some disclosure around potential earn-outs, but honestly David, the deal was just signed today, so I'm not 100% sure what the disclosure will look like in our financials, but we'll -- that's something that maybe our guys could look at that and just give with you off off-line on that. In any case, it's not that material to the overall picture. So I think even if you see what it might look like, I don't think it's going to -- it's not going to change the way that the deal looks. And as I said, to the extent that anything is paid, it will actually be a success because it means that we've added more revenue than perhaps we even expected. Colin, I think we're probably ready \u2013 I think we've already used up our allotted time. So I just want to thank everybody for joining the call, and we look forward to catching up with you next quarter to share our year-end results."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VP of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\nMark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 29th, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, some of our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package which is located on the landing page of our investor relations website. With that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan to comment on the second quarter.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. The second quarter was another solid one with good execution operationally and financial results in line with our expectations. Accounting for recent weakening in foreign exchange rates, we have modestly lowered our full-year outlook for most financial measures. However, on a constant currency basis, we have slightly increased our projected full-year results. The year has largely unfolded as we had expected. Steady carrier activity across our markets, but no material inflection in new lease and amendment executions thus far into the year. In the US, we have continued to receive increased inquiries from our customers, which is a good sign, but to date we have only seen a modest increase in new business executions. Looking out over the next several years though, we are very excited about the prospects for further increased demand. Mobile network consumption continues to grow at a very healthy pace, adding strain to existing networks. The offering of fixed wireless access by all three of our major customers will only add to this network strain. I have mentioned it before but I believe it bears repeating. The average fixed wireless access user consumes 15 to 25 times the data that a typical mobile wireless user consumes. As a result, the equivalent mobile subscriber additions to our customers networks is significantly higher than it has been in the past. This phenomenon will require continued network investment by our customers to keep pace with the demand. And all have publicly discussed plans to continue to grow fixed wireless access subscribers over the next several years. We also expect that the eventual incorporation of new Generative AI capabilities into handsets will further increase network consumption. In addition, the percentage of our existing leases with the big three carriers that have been upgraded with mid-band 5G spectrum still remains at just over 50%, leaving a significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Varying rates of 5G progress among our largest customers creates competitive pressures that we believe will also be a driver of future network investment, just as it has been in past cycles. Incidentally, mid-band 5G spectrum upgrades in our international markets are at even lower percentages of completion than in the US. Beyond all these demand-oriented drivers, we expect increased network spending driven by 5G coverage commitments made in connection with past regulatory approvals. Some of these commitments not only require coverage of POPs, but also minimum downlink speeds. This means that denser buildouts and expansion into areas not previously prioritized, particularly rural areas, will become more important as deadlines approach. We believe we are well situated to assist our customers in meeting their objectives with both our assets and our services support solutions. We are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change materially overnight, but the signs of numerous demand drivers are all there, and we are confident in our long-term organic growth prospects. In our services business, we had another good quarter as well. Revenue was up 15% from the first quarter and our gross profit contribution was ahead of our internal expectations. We have lowered our full year outlook for services revenue by $10 million at the midpoint due to a lower anticipated level of construction work, although we still expect to increase that number in the second half of the year over first half levels. Notwithstanding this lowered revenue outlook, we have not reduced our expected gross profit contributions to our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook as we continue to secure higher margin work. Our services teams continue to perform very well for our customers, helping them to significantly reduce their deployment cycle times. Internationally, results were also in line with expectations in the prior quarter, although we did see a pick-up in new leasing activity during the quarter, increasing the contribution to full year revenue from new leases and amendments. Each of our markets has opportunities for increased organic growth as new spectrum and new generations of wireless technology are rolled out. Challenging macroeconomic factors and imbalanced market share among mobile network operators in some of our markets has led to consolidations and increased network rationalizations, presenting some near-term challenges, but ultimately bolstering the strength and sustainability of our customers' prospects. We continue to work toward enhancing our own market positioning and our alignment with the leading carriers in each of our markets. We believe our efforts will ultimately enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows and increase our opportunities to capture incremental organic leasing revenue growth. During the second quarter, we also continued a balanced approach to capital allocation with a mix of portfolio expansion, stock repurchases, dividends, and debt reduction. I anticipate that we will continue to balance our capital allocation for the remainder of the year. Since our last earnings call, we have largely focused on debt reduction and have reduced our outstanding revolver balance to just $30 million as of today. We have some upcoming debt maturities that we anticipate refinancing in the near future. But until that time, we will likely continue to prioritize debt reduction and liquidity. The debt markets are wide open to us and have also improved over the last few months as we have seen some tightening of rates. Our quarter-end net debt to adjust to EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4 times. So, while our current priority is debt reduction, we have preserved the flexibility to take advantage of material value enhancing investment opportunities if they arise. We continue to explore and stay educated about the numerous asset portfolios available throughout our markets, but we'll retain an informed financial discipline in our approach to these opportunities. Our approach has really not changed, but our increased cost of capital has certainly underscored the emphasis we place on precise valuation and strategic rationale. I still believe we are the best in the business at valuing, integrating, and operating tower assets. So I believe we can continue to create value through asset acquisitions. We have a great long-term steady cash flow, low-risk business. The underlying strength of wireless dependent products and services will continue to drive increased needs for enhanced infrastructure solutions, and we have positioned ourselves as a key partner for our customers in meeting the challenges of addressing those needs. Before turning it over to Marc to share some more specifics on our second quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. With that, I'll now turn things over to Marc who will provide additional details.\nMarc Montagner: Thank you, Brendan. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectation. Second quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis and 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $8.2 million of the second quarter churn was related to spring consolidation churn. International same tower recurring cash easing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 2.7% net, including 5.3% of turn, or 8% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.4% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, the reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI link escalator in Brazil. We continue to see strong organic leads up in our international market. Total international returns remain elevated in the second quarter due mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. During the second quarter, 79% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. Let me now cover our revised outlook for 2024. Excluding the impact of weak foreign currency assumptions, we slightly increase our full outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and FFO per shares compared to our prior outlook. The devaluation of the Brazilian real versus the US dollar is estimated to have a negative impact to our site leasing revenue of approximately $19 million in 2024 versus our prior forecast in May. With regard to site development revenue, we are forecasting lower construction volume for the full year and therefore have lowered our full year outlook by $10 million. However, we have not reduced expectations for gross profit contribution for this business as we continue to execute well and secure higher margin work. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisition beyond those as of today that are already under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Outlook for net cash interest expenses and core FFO and FFO per share now assume a September 1st refinancing of the $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October 2024. We assume that we're financing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. As a result of this revised financial assumption and projected lower cash taxes, a full-year FFO per share outlook has increased by $0.09, excluding the impact of FX changes. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity. Our current leverage of 6.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains very strong at 5.2 times. Our weighted average maturity is approximately four years with an average interest rate of 3% across our total outstanding debt. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $30 million balance under our $2 billion revolver. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.3 million, or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on September 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 22, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% of the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023. And operator, with that we are ready to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess the first question, if I could, maybe either for -- I don't know who this question goes to. Just talking a little bit about the evolution of the financing market, there's been a lot of movement in the last few weeks. You guys took some steps to try to maybe pre-finance the term loan coming due in 2025. I'm wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit about what the landscape looks like and how the rates that you are being presented look relative to what they might have looked like a month ago? And then if I could, the second one is, just for our, just as a reminder, Marc or Brendan, when we think about how you guys choose to budget FX into your guidance, with the real blowing out to like BRL5.60, are you looking at forward rates? Are you looking at spot rates? How are you deciding what you're going to bake into guidance, which seems to be the biggest moving part in what happened this quarter? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I'll jump in first, David, and Marc can add in anything that he thinks I need to -- that I missed on the financing market. The market certainly has been improving. Obviously, there's a greater expectation in terms of rates. The next financing -- the refinancing that we have to do are of ABS debt that's outstanding. And we expect to do that with a like instrument and those instruments are typically priced as a spread to treasuries. So the improved general sentiment around forward rates affects the treasuries and that obviously is helpful to the potential pricing of those financing that we have ahead. But just beyond that, there's a high demand for the type of paper that we issue. And I think there's opportunity to see that continue to improve moving forward. As it relates to the term loan that we did before, it's floating rate, so really that didn't change much and we had a hedge in place. So obviously an improving rate environment will directly help that particular instrument, particularly when the hedge falls away next year. So on the second question regarding the FX forecasting, we typically will use as we go into the year, a forward market. We'll look at what are the general consensus of projections for that year, primarily around Brazil, around all of our foreign currencies, but Brazil is the biggest one. And we will usually pay it to that. Unfortunately, those projections have not turned out to be right thus far this year, and the currency has weakened much more than was originally expected. And the rate that we're using now for the balance of the year is pretty close to spot, which is also in line generally with projections, but obviously it's an inexact science. So we would prefer to try and nail it right on and not have to change it, but that's a hard task.\nDavid Barden: Okay, great. Thank you for the color, Brendan.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good afternoon. First, on M&A, you put this comment in about taking advantage of material value, enhancing investment opportunities as they arise. Has something changed that you're looking more closely at that now, maybe given you get through some of this financing, or is it just consistent with where you've been before? And any thoughts around how you're thinking about geographies? I know you talked before about Europe being interesting, but is it mostly developed market or US and Europe or would you look at expanding and existing or new developing markets? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah. The comment about material value enhancing, obviously that's not different than what we've done in the past. I think the key difference now is that with our leverage having come down to a much lower place, actually the lowest place it's been in our history, it allows for flexibility that if we saw something of material size that we thought would be value enhancing to be able to transact that maybe easier than it would have been in the past. But our approach is not that different. Obviously, cost of capital is higher, and so that affects what we can pay or where we see value in terms of the opportunities that are out there. But it's our goal and intention to hopefully find opportunities that are creative and add other value, even strategic value in terms of positioning to the extent it's in international markets for example. And I think you should expect that we're constantly looking and that hopefully we will find those opportunities just as we've done in the past. In terms of the where, it really depends. I mean, mostly we're focused on the markets that we're in, but we kind of scour the globe and we look at everything that's available. We look at opportunities that are in markets we're not in, because sometimes we see things that we think will fit very well and will be long-term value creating. So there's not a specific target, but to the extent that we can add in markets where we already are, there's obviously some synergies associated with the operations around that.\nSimon Flannery: And do you think we're getting to a better place between private and public multiples? Because it seems like they've been quite a spread there for a while.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think it's moving more in the right direction than it has in the past few years. Specifically internationally, I would say we're seeing that constrain meaningfully in terms of the difference between the twp. Domestically, it's probably less so, and I think that's mostly a function of just limited supply in the US. And obviously, it's kind of the prime tower market. But even in the US, I'm starting to see some indications that maybe that gap will narrow a little bit.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, could you maybe tell us how you're thinking about the various international markets where you have a presence already today? Any attractiveness of staying in markets where you arguably are subscale relative to getting bigger in ones where you already have a meaningful presence?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah. As we mentioned it at the beginning of the year on our first call of the year about our approach, that we're doing a review kind of all of our not only our international markets but all of our business lines. But specifically as it relates to our international markets, what we've determined as we kind of look through it is it definitely is an advantage to be of greater scale, to be of more relevance to your customers in the markets that you're in. And in some places we are in that position, and in other places we are not. And so, to the extent that we can solve that issue through expansion in some of those markets, we would like to do that. If we do not see a reasonable way to do that, then we may look to move on from certain markets as we've done, at least with one in the past. So we're continuing through that exercise, and even though there's no real update on that at the moment, it's not because there's no progress being made, there is in fact a lot of progress being made, but we're not at a point to be able to discuss specifics yet, but we will be down the road. So ideally, we'll look to be able to have a good scale in each of the markets that we're in, and we'll also look to be aligned with the stronger carriers that are operating in those markets as well.\nJim Schneider: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up, relative to the downtick in site development expectations for the year, I know that's not impacting the gross profit line because you're picking more profitable business, but can you maybe just comment on what that signifies in terms of domestic care activity, broadly speaking, and whether that's any kind of leading indicator of a more of your environment, or is that just you being selective in the business you're taking from them?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I don\u2019t -- it's not really signifying much. It is -- the mix of work that we're doing is a little bit different. It's a little more oriented towards consulting or site development services type of business as opposed to construction. So the top line volume ends up being lower, but the margin ends up being higher on that. And our outlook, although it is lowered in total for the year, and that's really based on the first half of the year, honestly, we expect the second half of the year, and it's implied in the number, to be higher in terms of the volume than the first half of the year. So I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a sign of it being more muted. I think it's just the mix of work as much as anything.\nJim Schneider: Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. First, there are a few assets on the market in Europe right now. I'm just curious, at a high level, could you give us your thoughts philosophically on the European tower market? Maybe if you could compare and contrast the opportunities and headwinds for that market. And then my second question would be, just based on everything you're seeing domestically at the moment, do you believe we can see domestic new leasing in 2025 be up versus 2024 levels? And kind of, if not, when is the drop dead for us to see a pick-up in activity for it to really be reflected in 2025? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure, I just -- I'll do the second question first. I mean, we're obviously not in a position today to give outlook on 2025, so I don't really want to get into that too much. And so much of what \u201825 will look like is going to be based very heavily on what we see happen in the second half of \u201824. So I would say just hold tight and we'll see how that goes. If we don't see any real uptick in carrier spending in the second half of 2024, then it likely would not be up, but there's still a lot of that story to be written, so we'll see where it goes. On your first question on Europe, we obviously don't have any operations in Europe. So my views and opinions are based on just looking at it from the outside in. We've explored opportunities as they've come up in Europe. And I think the positives there are obviously you've got a very stable type of market in terms of currency, in terms of rule of law and regulations. It's very established. But it's also slow growth and I think there are some churn risks that exist there, particularly as you see carriers consolidating their network operations. And so, any decision to expand into Europe will be opportunity specific and dependent upon the valuation as much as anything and what we see as the specifics around that particular portfolio if we decide to go that route. So yeah, we look at everything that comes available as I said earlier and if we see something we'll explore it. And if we don't, then we're perfectly content where we're at.\nMichael Elias: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Just wanted to ask on the leverage. It's continued to go down and it seems like it'll continue to trend that way given if there's nothing out in the M&A environment. How low could we see that leverage go to over the foreseeable future? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. Well, it's not our intention to necessarily see it continue to go lower. That's really going to be a function of the alternative uses of capital. So I can't give you an exact number. I think depending on the opportunities that come along for investment into the business and to assets, that will be the main driver of where leverage goes. If we see an opportunity to expand in a way that we think will be value additive to us long term, then you may see leverage tick back up. If we don't see that, then leverage will probably continue to decline. Eventually, we'll have to explore what that means in terms of investment grade, but I don't think we're quite there yet.\nRichard Choe: It seems like the opportunities have been a little bit slow in the first half of this year. Do you think things will pick up in the second half and as we go into next year?\nBrendan Cavanagh: You mean opportunities for asset acquisitions?\nRichard Choe: Yes.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I would not say that they are slow. I would say that nothing has been secured, certainly signed up or closed as of yet that\u2019s of a major scale, but there are a lot of different portfolios and opportunities out there. So I think my M&A team would not agree with that it's slow because they've been very busy. But what that ends up resulting in will depend on whether we can find something we like in terms we find attractive.\nRichard Choe: Great, thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Hey, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: Hey. When you get quarters, like most recently, with the FX rate, does it cause you to pause a little bit and think, why are we so heavily involved in some of these international countries? Or how should we think about what moments like this when you have to pull down the guidance because of FX to David's questions earlier? How do you kind of square that with where you want to see the company go longer term?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think, Ric, it's a -- obviously, we have what we have. We have a big embedded business, particularly in Brazil, and it's got that risk, and we've seen it in past cycles, too. And, of course, it's disappointing to us to have to lower outlook based solely on that particular issue. I think it does impact or influence the way that we think about the mix of our asset base and our revenue base to have something that's a little more stable. I think at the beginning of the year when we were talking about our overall goals and the way that we look at things, stability was kind of a key point in that. And obviously, this particular item introduces an element of instability that I would prefer not to have. However, we have a very good business down there. There's a lot of good things that are going on in Brazil. And so trying to navigate through the right way to reduce that exposure probably comes through increased exposure in other places that perhaps have more stable currencies. So we'll see if we can do that but I would say that it at least influences us to not get too overextended to some of these currencies that have greater volatility.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. And you had a comment earlier that the US is still about 50% done on the mid-band deployment varies by carrier significantly possibly and international as well. Can you give us kind of a spot number? Where are the international markets on kind of that mid-band or 5G spectrum deployment?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I do have that and it does vary by market and I think maybe something we can share with you offline because I don't have it right in front of me. It's kind of a mix, but I would say, this is me ballparking it based on what I've seen for each country that we've got. You're looking at somewhere in the probably 25% or less on average across all of the existing international markets that we're in.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And then Simon asked a question about public versus private multiples. Take that a little bit further. And what are the pros and cons of maybe selling a piece of your domestic business if private multiples stay above public multiples, i.e. American Tower did it with the Telxius European, did it with core data centers. So it's kind of a way to bring capital in, could be used to address the balance sheet. But kind of your thoughts, pros and cons on kind of that disparity between public and private and that maybe you could sell, buy high, sell low, kind of find a place to say, well, can we get [them mark] (ph) to market?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think that's never been a big part of our goal is to shrink through selling off assets. I think certainly, partnerships that bring in partners is a possibility that we would consider. But in terms of selling assets, I would say it's on the table, Ric, if in fact evaluations are just at a level that we believe is clearly well above the credit that we're getting for those assets, but there's a lot of logistics that we would have to work through as well. We obviously have financing structures, we have MLA agreements, we have a number of different things that would impact our ability to kind of hive off assets here in the US. But I wouldn't rule it out altogether. I just would say that it's not at the top of the list ideally.\nRic Prentiss: Makes sense. It's complicated, but something should be at least studied.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, and maybe just one other thought on that as I'm thinking about it. We always talk about the disconnect, and I think the inference is always that the disconnect is that the private multiples are too high, I might flip that around and suggest that the public multiples perhaps are too low. So it's not -- when it closes, which way it closes will obviously have an impact on how you feel about that sort of an exit.\nRic Prentiss: Exactly. I know we agree with that and that sometimes a mark to market wakes the public up to what the real value is. All right. Hey, appreciate it, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. Two questions. One, anything about the build-to-suit opportunity, given your recent run rate of domestic builds-to-suit, and anything that you see that might cause you to want to get a little more aggressive on that? And then on the leasing side, I think I heard you say increased interest, some of it due to mandated kind of rural build-outs. Anything attributable to FWA, you mentioned that in your remarks, but anything yet apparent in your leasing pipeline that you would attribute to fix wireless access? And then I've got to follow up. Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Okay. Yeah. On the BTS, I think you said, if I heard you correctly, you were talking specifically about domestic builds, John?\nJon Atkin: Yes.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah. I mean, we would like to do more of those certainly. I mean obviously you've seen our numbers over the last few years. They haven't been particularly heroic and a lot of that's because the carriers have tended to go to low-cost providers because that's a choice that they have because there's so much capital out there supporting this particular industry. So we would like to do more. We found a way to do that though is to secure high quality locations to get out ahead of where coverage needs are and secure those opportunities in more of a strategic manner as opposed to pure build astute, although we do some of those still. But yeah, I'd like to be more aggressive on it, for sure. I just don't know if we're going to get to numbers that really move the needle too much. In terms of our backlog and the fixed wireless access influence on it, it's hard for us to say exactly, because fixed wireless access is typically using the 5G oriented mid-band spectrum that is being deployed more broadly. And so I think to date, most of these fixed wireless subscribers have been supported through excess mid-band spectrum that's been deployed, capacity on that spectrum that's been deployed already but it's starting to get closer to a point where that's going to be harder to do because of the amount of consumption for that particular product. So I can't draw a direct line to it yet, but we see signs that the customer's networks are going to become more and more congested as a result of that product, and that ultimately is very good for us.\nJon Atkin: And then AMX seems to have kind of increased as a percentage of your international leasing. Anything around their activity level, or is it a matter of other operators maybe moderating their activity, any color there?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah it's actually Two things. It's one, they have been very active, they've probably been our most active leasing customer broadly across our international markets. But two, with the FX decline in Brazil, they are obviously a tenant there but they have a presence in a number of our other markets, so they're not as affected as some of the other carriers on that list that we share. So their percentage just by default comes up as a result of the FX shift.\nJon Atkin: And then lastly, I've got a question on the balance sheet. Is it -- would it make any sense to utilize your revolver to pay down the ABS debt and then see kind of what happens in terms of Fed cuts later in the year and wait to issue ABS after that?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I mean, it could, although you're really making a little bit of a bet because if you're using the ABS market to refinance the existing ABS debt, you are using a benchmark rate that implies a certain expectation around the rate. It's not directly affected by when the Fed cuts, if they cut. So if you were to say, well, I'll hold off and take my chances and do it down the road, the revolver will be priced at a higher rate. So for the time being, you will be paying a much higher rate than you otherwise would. And so does it make sense? Plus we have other financings maturing, one big one in January and then others in January of \u201826. So you can only do that for a limited period of time. So I'm kind of inclined not to think about it that way. But the good news is, we have tremendous liquidity and we can be flexible if necessary.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. I had two questions. First, with respect to the domestic carrier conversations that you referenced, can you share if those are related to the typical a la carte business that you've seen from your carrier customers, or are these discussions possibly getting you closer to signing additional comprehensive MLAs with additional national wireless carriers? And second, is there any change in timing or magnitude of the anticipated multi-year churn from mergers and industry rationalization for both the domestic and the international segments? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yeah, I mean the conversation -- we're in regular conversations on a daily basis at all different levels with our carrier customers. And so, conversations cover a wide variety of topics and those certainly include the potential for larger, broader deals, but I wouldn't say that that is the sole focus for the time being. We're operating under the existing agreements that we have in place. We do have existing MLAs in place. Some of those involve a la carte type of arrangements, but they define those pretty well. So we continue with business as usual on that front and try to figure out where our customers could use our help the most in terms of their broader, bigger picture initiatives. And if that's best served through an MLA, we're open to that as a possibility. On the timing and the magnitude of the churn from the consolidations, it hasn't really changed too much. I think we tweaked our churn outlook in the US up just slightly, and that had to do basically with the timing of some of the Sprint churn being slightly earlier, but these are really fairly small changes in terms of the overall expectation, for instance, around Sprint. It hasn't changed from what we've given out in the past and I think was reiterated by Marc in his comments earlier today. And internationally, that's generally the case as well. The one thing that could change that is if we were to reach some sort of agreement, specifically with Claro around their Oi wireless overlap in Brazil that pulled forward or changed the timing for some of that, that could obviously have an impact. But as of today, it continues along the same path as we previously laid out.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon. I apologize. Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Thanks for joining my questions. First, regarding the pickup in new leasing activity overseas that you cited, can you drill down on that a little bit? Is it coming from a particular market or markets? Does it feel like a blip or the start of something more sustained? Any color there would be great.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, it\u2019s -- I would say that it was across a number of our different markets. I mentioned earlier that Claro was busy. They were a big driver of that. And yeah, I can't say for sure whether it's to be sustained, but our backlogs continue to be pretty strong. And so I hope that in fact it will be. I think there's a lot to do as we look at the needs that these carriers have. It's really more of a financial question, I think, than anything else. So I think it's a good sign to see it ahead of the pace that we expected to be at, at this point. And at this point, I think that that will continue throughout the balance of the year, and we'll let you know where we are as we get into next year.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And then to follow up on some of the M&A questions, there might be a couple good sized portfolios for sale in the US. I guess, given your current size, 17,500 towers, do you think there are still meaningful strategic or cost efficiency or other benefits to having greater scale in the US? Or do you feel like, given your scale, for all practical purposes there aren't scale driven benefits to be had from a potential deal of those sizes?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I think from an operational standpoint that the scale benefits are very limited because we're pretty streamlined at this point. I think there are some certainly but I think it's relatively small part of any large scale deal that we would do here in the US. But there probably are some benefits in terms of just being able to help our customers achieve some of their broader reaching goals if we have a bigger portfolio. That does make a little bit of a difference, I think. But I don't think it's a major factor. I think ultimately they'll need the sites that they need, and we have a lot of great sites and a lot of great locations that are frankly ones that can't be duplicated. So it's something that we would think would be marginally beneficial from a strategic standpoint but marginally being the key word.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks, Brendan.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Nispel: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brandon, you mentioned the US increase in the -- moderate increase in new business execution. Can you comment\u2026\nBrendan Cavanagh: Hey, Brandon.\nBrandon Nispel: Yep.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Brandon, I'm sorry. You were muffled there. I couldn't really hear what you said.\nBrandon Nispel: Right, can you guys hear me okay?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, that's better. Thanks.\nBrandon Nispel: All right, so you, Brandon, you mentioned increased increase and modest increase in new business execution in the US. Can you say the same for your backlog of lease applications? Is it up or down versus this time last year? Then as we look at the guidance for the rest of the year, it looks like from a new leasing standpoint in the US, it does imply lower in the second half versus the first half. Are you at the point where you can say with confidence that leasing has troughed or is it potential that we see leasing below this $42 million level for next year based on the application pipeline that you have? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I can't give you next year's numbers at this point. I would tell you that from an application standpoint, we have seen increases. Each of the last couple of quarters, quarter-over-quarter, continues to go up, so that's a good sign. But an application doesn't necessarily tell the whole story because you have to see how that plays through and what's the level of equipment that they're installing and so forth. I do think with the increases that we're seeing in terms of interest and applications that we'll see an opportunity to have greater executions as we move through the year, particularly into next year. But there's so much that still has to be -- has to play out for us to know what that does to next year's number that -- it's premature for me to say.\nBrandon Nispel: Got it. And could I follow up? On the services guidance cut, last year, and historically T-Mobile's been north of 70% of that business, can you say that the client and services guide was broad, meaning more than one customer, or was it concentrated in one customer? Thanks.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I would say that it was broad in the sense that it was across the customers that make up that revenue base, although we do have certain concentrations. So obviously it's a greater absolute dollar amount from certain carriers. But there's nothing that stands out about that. It's really more, as I said earlier, it's really more about the mix of work being a little more SDS related instead of construction related.\nBrandon Nispel: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Just two follow-ups. First, I guess to the topic of carrier activity, any changes in activity or uptick in conversations with DISH? And then secondly, on the operational review of the business, I know it was a bigger topic last call and I know it sounds like there's more going on behind the scenes, but is there's any initial findings or when we can anticipate more meaningful updates on that front? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. On DISH, there's been -- we continue to have conversations. They actually do continue to sign leases with us, but there hasn't been any material inflection in that. And we're waiting to see how their plans evolve, if they evolve. I'm sure there are conversations ongoing in terms of the deadlines around their commitments for coverage for next year, and financing, and a number of other things. But we're just here trying to be the best partner we can be to them on their needs. And they continue to sign leases in places where they need it, but it's obviously at a lower level than it was a couple of years ago. So nothing really new there. On the strategic or operational review, yeah, there's only so much I could say at this point because we've done a lot of work, but until we're ready to share with you specific takeaway, specific actions that are being taken, it would be premature for me to talk about that right now. But I do think certainly by the end of the year, I would expect that there will be a number of things that we can share.\nMatt Niknam: Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. It seems on a number of fronts you're in sort of de-risking mode, reducing leverage, considering going at investment grade, exiting some non-core markets. How should we think about your risk tolerance going forward over the next few years relative to what it's been over the past few?\nBrendan Cavanagh: I think it will be an informed amount of risk. There's always some degree of risk, particularly when you're making decisions to invest capital and expand by buying or building new assets. So I believe that all of the learnings that we have over the years and what we've seen in each of the markets where we operate make us better informed to understand the risk that we're taking on and to manage and frankly price that in in any decisions that we make. So I don't know that it's changed a lot. I think the knowledge that we have changes every day and that informs it, but our overall risk tolerance is probably not that different, just our education is a little different.\nBrendan Lynch: Maybe just to dig in on that a little bit more. Obviously, there's been changes in the cost of capital and the opportunity set. But maybe talk about those dynamics also in the context of just the maturity of the market and how much risk you're willing to take to pursue the next level of growth that might be available.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, so much of the decisions around investments in the new assets is impacted by your view of the future of those assets in the markets and what are the M&Os in those particular markets going to be doing and what are their needs going forward. And I think almost in every case, when one tower company buys a portfolio instead of another, it probably comes down typically to their view of the future. And one has maybe a slightly more favorable view than another, and therefore they are able to see their way clear to pay a little bit more. And I don't think things are any different than that today. Obviously, the cost of capital being higher makes a difference, but it's higher for everybody. And I think that's what started to normalize. It started to make its way through the system, whereas before you had certain folks who were using capital that was priced at a much lower point, and that was allowing them to continue on buying stuff at prices that were suddenly becoming not as attractive to some of us that were affected more quickly by the change in cost of capital. So I don't think it's any different. I think it's just a matter of everybody adjusting to the cost of capital and then how you see your way clear to obtain the growth necessary on the assets that you're buying.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for the color.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thank you. Maybe just going back to the carrier inquiries you alluded to, is there any additional context you can provide as to how they've changed and how typical or atypical is it for these conversations to ultimately materialize in better leasing?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, they change in the sense that, at a given point in time in a given market a carrier has more or less initiatives, certain specific needs. They either have them or they don't in a given window of time. But that's not really different than the history of it. It's just as cyclical in different places. So I don't think that the conversations are necessarily that different. I think when they change more meaningfully is when there's a big initiative, a big project, a new spectrum band to roll out or a particular initiative that is carrier specific and that will lead perhaps to maybe a bigger scale agreement, that sort of thing. But the conversations inform our view on where they're going and allow us to better position ourselves in order to capture a greater percentage of the business that's going to come as a result of those initiatives.\nAri Klein: Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Jonathan Chaplin] (ph) with New Street. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. It's Jonathan Chaplin. Two questions, if I may. You mentioned earlier that if you didn't secure attractive assets, that your leverage might continue to tick down. Of course, you could repurchase shares. And I think you also said earlier that you thought the public multiples are too low. Your stock is undervalued. So it's the reason that leverage would tick down. But for asset acquisitions that don't include your own assets, it sort of indicates that you think it's probable that you're going to pick up a decent sized portfolio in the relatively near future. Otherwise, you'd be buying back stock. Or rather, buying back stock and keeping leverage constant.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, yeah, I didn't say that we are definitely buying a material portfolio. I'd say that we are looking at all kinds of things that are available. And some of those include material portfolios. But whether those happen or not remains to be seen. So sometimes you have to be patient in terms of how you use your capital. We've in the past had people say, well, you must not like your stock because you didn't buy it this quarter. Well, that's not necessarily true. It depends on other things that are going on that take a lot longer than one or two months to determine how they're going to play out. So I think what you should expect is going forward, we will over time have a mix of all of these things. We will do buybacks, we will do debt paydowns, and we will also hopefully buy assets.\nJonathan Chaplin: Got it. And then on a completely different track, which markets do you feel like you're subscaling? And what was sort of different about the thesis when you entered that market versus how it's played out in terms of, did you expect there to be more organic growth in those markets or more portfolios to come up for sale or the portfolios that did come up for sale came at prices that you weren't willing to compete for?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I think in the past when we first were entering certain of these markets, our view on scale was that scale is reaching a point that you cover your overhead and you produce positive EBITDA. And I think where our view has evolved is that scale is more than that. It's your relevance to the leading carriers in the market and if you don't have that and in particular international more than this is the case in the US internationally, if you don't have that the way that work is handed out, the way that carriers engage with providers, tower providers in this case, is influenced by the relative importance to their network that you represent. And so we have some places where we simply have small portfolios and there are much bigger players. And so we either need to figure out how to become a bigger player that's more relevant to our customers or we shouldn't be there.\nJonathan Chaplin: All right. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate that.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBatya Levi: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups. First, on the domestic side, normal churn is still running at the high end of 1% to 2% you've laid out. Do you see some opportunity to lower that to the low end? I think some of your peers are suggesting it. And a reminder on the exposure to US seller would be good and how long you have left on that contract? And lastly, SG&A stepped down sequentially, can you talk about if that level is sustainable going forward? Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. The opportunity for lower domestic churn, yes. I do think that excluding, of course, Sprint or any other material consolidation that might take place that we would see that number trend down over time. A lot of that was made up of stuff that was smaller companies and that kind of thing. So, I expect to see less and less of that. But we'll see as we get into next year and the years beyond. US Cellular, we have a fairly immaterial exposure. We have less than $20 million a year in revenue from US Cellular and even, obviously a smaller percentage of that overlaps with T-Mobile. So I don't think it'll be overly material, whatever happens there. And on the SG&A front, it did step down quarter over quarter, but typically the first quarter is our highest quarter because of payroll taxes and a number of other specific things. So I think we're at a fairly normal level, but over time it will probably move up with the typical cost of living type of increases that you would expect for overhead of our type.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hey, thanks. We don't often get to hear about your track record on deals, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of your recent investments like in Tanzania and the Philippines? How they fare? It would be great just to hear about actual performance in those markets versus your initial underwriting, especially if we kind of consider the capital allocation track record you have as you pursue external growth going forward?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get too specific on all that, but just to touch on the ones that you mentioned, Tanzania, thus far has worked out extremely well. We've had tremendous growth there that we've been very pleased with from an organic leasing standpoint. Obviously, the entry price we came in was attractive and so the return on investment capital thus far has been tremendous in that market. In the case of the Philippines, it was a little bit of a totally different animal. There wasn't an acquisition there. That was almost all brand new builds. And it's really at a fairly early stage. So I'd say that so far it's gone well. The leasing has been strong, but we have a very small portfolio and they're brand new sites. So we've got to give that a little bit more time to see how it plays out.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. And then, speaking on the topic on acquisitions, you might have mentioned this in the past, but just to clarify, are you more focused on macro tower assets, or given your experience, you guys have made investments in DAS networks and data centers, is that on the table? And then I guess you kind of carry that over to active equipment. We hear about some of that in Europe, and then some fiber assets as well. Just wondering how far you'd want to stretch out that in macro towers?\nBrendan Cavanagh: Yeah, I mean, we're a macro tower company, so that\u2019s obviously we've spent the vast majority of our time. The other things were specific items that had ancillary strategic rationale that we were looking at, but it's not the core of what we look at.\nDavid Guarino: Okay, thank you.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure.\nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you all for joining the call, and we look forward to reporting our results next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Second quarter domestic same tower revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis and 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $8.2 million of the second quarter churn was related to spring consolidation churn. International same tower recurring cash easing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 2.7% net, including 5.3% of turn, or 8% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.4% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, the reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI link escalator in Brazil. We continue to see strong organic leads up in our international market. Total international returns remain elevated in the second quarter due mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. During the second quarter, 79% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in US dollars. The majority of non-US dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. Let me now cover our revised outlook for 2024. Excluding the impact of weak foreign currency assumptions, we slightly increase our full outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and FFO per shares compared to our prior outlook. The devaluation of the Brazilian real versus the US dollar is estimated to have a negative impact to our site leasing revenue of approximately $19 million in 2024 versus our prior forecast in May. With regard to site development revenue, we are forecasting lower construction volume for the full year and therefore have lowered our full year outlook by $10 million. However, we have not reduced expectations for gross profit contribution for this business as we continue to execute well and secure higher margin work. Please also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisition beyond those as of today that are already under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Outlook for net cash interest expenses and core FFO and FFO per share now assume a September 1st refinancing of the $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October 2024. We assume that we're financing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. As a result of this revised financial assumption and projected lower cash taxes, a full-year FFO per share outlook has increased by $0.09, excluding the impact of FX changes. Let me now turn the call over to Mark."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. The second quarter was another solid one with good execution operationally and financial results in line with our expectations. Accounting for recent weakening in foreign exchange rates, we have modestly lowered our full-year outlook for most financial measures. However, on a constant currency basis, we have slightly increased our projected full-year results. The year has largely unfolded as we had expected. Steady carrier activity across our markets, but no material inflection in new lease and amendment executions thus far into the year. In the US, we have continued to receive increased inquiries from our customers, which is a good sign, but to date we have only seen a modest increase in new business executions. Looking out over the next several years though, we are very excited about the prospects for further increased demand. Mobile network consumption continues to grow at a very healthy pace, adding strain to existing networks. The offering of fixed wireless access by all three of our major customers will only add to this network strain. I have mentioned it before but I believe it bears repeating. The average fixed wireless access user consumes 15 to 25 times the data that a typical mobile wireless user consumes. As a result, the equivalent mobile subscriber additions to our customers networks is significantly higher than it has been in the past. This phenomenon will require continued network investment by our customers to keep pace with the demand. And all have publicly discussed plans to continue to grow fixed wireless access subscribers over the next several years. We also expect that the eventual incorporation of new Generative AI capabilities into handsets will further increase network consumption. In addition, the percentage of our existing leases with the big three carriers that have been upgraded with mid-band 5G spectrum still remains at just over 50%, leaving a significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Varying rates of 5G progress among our largest customers creates competitive pressures that we believe will also be a driver of future network investment, just as it has been in past cycles. Incidentally, mid-band 5G spectrum upgrades in our international markets are at even lower percentages of completion than in the US. Beyond all these demand-oriented drivers, we expect increased network spending driven by 5G coverage commitments made in connection with past regulatory approvals. Some of these commitments not only require coverage of POPs, but also minimum downlink speeds. This means that denser buildouts and expansion into areas not previously prioritized, particularly rural areas, will become more important as deadlines approach. We believe we are well situated to assist our customers in meeting their objectives with both our assets and our services support solutions. We are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change materially overnight, but the signs of numerous demand drivers are all there, and we are confident in our long-term organic growth prospects. In our services business, we had another good quarter as well. Revenue was up 15% from the first quarter and our gross profit contribution was ahead of our internal expectations. We have lowered our full year outlook for services revenue by $10 million at the midpoint due to a lower anticipated level of construction work, although we still expect to increase that number in the second half of the year over first half levels. Notwithstanding this lowered revenue outlook, we have not reduced our expected gross profit contributions to our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook as we continue to secure higher margin work. Our services teams continue to perform very well for our customers, helping them to significantly reduce their deployment cycle times. Internationally, results were also in line with expectations in the prior quarter, although we did see a pick-up in new leasing activity during the quarter, increasing the contribution to full year revenue from new leases and amendments. Each of our markets has opportunities for increased organic growth as new spectrum and new generations of wireless technology are rolled out. Challenging macroeconomic factors and imbalanced market share among mobile network operators in some of our markets has led to consolidations and increased network rationalizations, presenting some near-term challenges, but ultimately bolstering the strength and sustainability of our customers' prospects. We continue to work toward enhancing our own market positioning and our alignment with the leading carriers in each of our markets. We believe our efforts will ultimately enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows and increase our opportunities to capture incremental organic leasing revenue growth. During the second quarter, we also continued a balanced approach to capital allocation with a mix of portfolio expansion, stock repurchases, dividends, and debt reduction. I anticipate that we will continue to balance our capital allocation for the remainder of the year. Since our last earnings call, we have largely focused on debt reduction and have reduced our outstanding revolver balance to just $30 million as of today. We have some upcoming debt maturities that we anticipate refinancing in the near future. But until that time, we will likely continue to prioritize debt reduction and liquidity. The debt markets are wide open to us and have also improved over the last few months as we have seen some tightening of rates. Our quarter-end net debt to adjust to EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4 times. So, while our current priority is debt reduction, we have preserved the flexibility to take advantage of material value enhancing investment opportunities if they arise. We continue to explore and stay educated about the numerous asset portfolios available throughout our markets, but we'll retain an informed financial discipline in our approach to these opportunities. Our approach has really not changed, but our increased cost of capital has certainly underscored the emphasis we place on precise valuation and strategic rationale. I still believe we are the best in the business at valuing, integrating, and operating tower assets. So I believe we can continue to create value through asset acquisitions. We have a great long-term steady cash flow, low-risk business. The underlying strength of wireless dependent products and services will continue to drive increased needs for enhanced infrastructure solutions, and we have positioned ourselves as a key partner for our customers in meeting the challenges of addressing those needs. Before turning it over to Marc to share some more specifics on our second quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. With that, I'll now turn things over to Marc who will provide additional details. Yeah. I'll jump in first, David, and Marc can add in anything that he thinks I need to -- that I missed on the financing market. The market certainly has been improving. Obviously, there's a greater expectation in terms of rates. The next financing -- the refinancing that we have to do are of ABS debt that's outstanding. And we expect to do that with a like instrument and those instruments are typically priced as a spread to treasuries. So the improved general sentiment around forward rates affects the treasuries and that obviously is helpful to the potential pricing of those financing that we have ahead. But just beyond that, there's a high demand for the type of paper that we issue. And I think there's opportunity to see that continue to improve moving forward. As it relates to the term loan that we did before, it's floating rate, so really that didn't change much and we had a hedge in place. So obviously an improving rate environment will directly help that particular instrument, particularly when the hedge falls away next year. So on the second question regarding the FX forecasting, we typically will use as we go into the year, a forward market. We'll look at what are the general consensus of projections for that year, primarily around Brazil, around all of our foreign currencies, but Brazil is the biggest one. And we will usually pay it to that. Unfortunately, those projections have not turned out to be right thus far this year, and the currency has weakened much more than was originally expected. And the rate that we're using now for the balance of the year is pretty close to spot, which is also in line generally with projections, but obviously it's an inexact science. So we would prefer to try and nail it right on and not have to change it, but that's a hard task. Sure. Sure. Yeah. The comment about material value enhancing, obviously that's not different than what we've done in the past. I think the key difference now is that with our leverage having come down to a much lower place, actually the lowest place it's been in our history, it allows for flexibility that if we saw something of material size that we thought would be value enhancing to be able to transact that maybe easier than it would have been in the past. But our approach is not that different. Obviously, cost of capital is higher, and so that affects what we can pay or where we see value in terms of the opportunities that are out there. But it's our goal and intention to hopefully find opportunities that are creative and add other value, even strategic value in terms of positioning to the extent it's in international markets for example. And I think you should expect that we're constantly looking and that hopefully we will find those opportunities just as we've done in the past. In terms of the where, it really depends. I mean, mostly we're focused on the markets that we're in, but we kind of scour the globe and we look at everything that's available. We look at opportunities that are in markets we're not in, because sometimes we see things that we think will fit very well and will be long-term value creating. So there's not a specific target, but to the extent that we can add in markets where we already are, there's obviously some synergies associated with the operations around that. Yeah, I think it's moving more in the right direction than it has in the past few years. Specifically internationally, I would say we're seeing that constrain meaningfully in terms of the difference between the twp. Domestically, it's probably less so, and I think that's mostly a function of just limited supply in the US. And obviously, it's kind of the prime tower market. But even in the US, I'm starting to see some indications that maybe that gap will narrow a little bit. Sure. Yeah. As we mentioned it at the beginning of the year on our first call of the year about our approach, that we're doing a review kind of all of our not only our international markets but all of our business lines. But specifically as it relates to our international markets, what we've determined as we kind of look through it is it definitely is an advantage to be of greater scale, to be of more relevance to your customers in the markets that you're in. And in some places we are in that position, and in other places we are not. And so, to the extent that we can solve that issue through expansion in some of those markets, we would like to do that. If we do not see a reasonable way to do that, then we may look to move on from certain markets as we've done, at least with one in the past. So we're continuing through that exercise, and even though there's no real update on that at the moment, it's not because there's no progress being made, there is in fact a lot of progress being made, but we're not at a point to be able to discuss specifics yet, but we will be down the road. So ideally, we'll look to be able to have a good scale in each of the markets that we're in, and we'll also look to be aligned with the stronger carriers that are operating in those markets as well. Yeah, I don't -- it's not really signifying much. It is -- the mix of work that we're doing is a little bit different. It's a little more oriented towards consulting or site development services type of business as opposed to construction. So the top line volume ends up being lower, but the margin ends up being higher on that. And our outlook, although it is lowered in total for the year, and that's really based on the first half of the year, honestly, we expect the second half of the year, and it's implied in the number, to be higher in terms of the volume than the first half of the year. So I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a sign of it being more muted. I think it's just the mix of work as much as anything. Sure. Sure, I just -- I'll do the second question first. I mean, we're obviously not in a position today to give outlook on 2025, so I don't really want to get into that too much. And so much of what \u201825 will look like is going to be based very heavily on what we see happen in the second half of \u201824. So I would say just hold tight and we'll see how that goes. If we don't see any real uptick in carrier spending in the second half of 2024, then it likely would not be up, but there's still a lot of that story to be written, so we'll see where it goes. On your first question on Europe, we obviously don't have any operations in Europe. So my views and opinions are based on just looking at it from the outside in. We've explored opportunities as they've come up in Europe. And I think the positives there are obviously you've got a very stable type of market in terms of currency, in terms of rule of law and regulations. It's very established. But it's also slow growth and I think there are some churn risks that exist there, particularly as you see carriers consolidating their network operations. And so, any decision to expand into Europe will be opportunity specific and dependent upon the valuation as much as anything and what we see as the specifics around that particular portfolio if we decide to go that route. So yeah, we look at everything that comes available as I said earlier and if we see something we'll explore it. And if we don't, then we're perfectly content where we're at. Sure. Well, it's not our intention to necessarily see it continue to go lower. That's really going to be a function of the alternative uses of capital. So I can't give you an exact number. I think depending on the opportunities that come along for investment into the business and to assets, that will be the main driver of where leverage goes. If we see an opportunity to expand in a way that we think will be value additive to us long term, then you may see leverage tick back up. If we don't see that, then leverage will probably continue to decline. Eventually, we'll have to explore what that means in terms of investment grade, but I don't think we're quite there yet. You mean opportunities for asset acquisitions? Yeah, I would not say that they are slow. I would say that nothing has been secured, certainly signed up or closed as of yet that's of a major scale, but there are a lot of different portfolios and opportunities out there. So I think my M&A team would not agree with that it's slow because they've been very busy. But what that ends up resulting in will depend on whether we can find something we like in terms we find attractive. Sure. Hey, Ric. Yeah, I think, Ric, it's a -- obviously, we have what we have. We have a big embedded business, particularly in Brazil, and it's got that risk, and we've seen it in past cycles, too. And, of course, it's disappointing to us to have to lower outlook based solely on that particular issue. I think it does impact or influence the way that we think about the mix of our asset base and our revenue base to have something that's a little more stable. I think at the beginning of the year when we were talking about our overall goals and the way that we look at things, stability was kind of a key point in that. And obviously, this particular item introduces an element of instability that I would prefer not to have. However, we have a very good business down there. There's a lot of good things that are going on in Brazil. And so trying to navigate through the right way to reduce that exposure probably comes through increased exposure in other places that perhaps have more stable currencies. So we'll see if we can do that but I would say that it at least influences us to not get too overextended to some of these currencies that have greater volatility. Yeah, I do have that and it does vary by market and I think maybe something we can share with you offline because I don't have it right in front of me. It's kind of a mix, but I would say, this is me ballparking it based on what I've seen for each country that we've got. You're looking at somewhere in the probably 25% or less on average across all of the existing international markets that we're in. Yeah, I think that's never been a big part of our goal is to shrink through selling off assets. I think certainly, partnerships that bring in partners is a possibility that we would consider. But in terms of selling assets, I would say it's on the table, Ric, if in fact evaluations are just at a level that we believe is clearly well above the credit that we're getting for those assets, but there's a lot of logistics that we would have to work through as well. We obviously have financing structures, we have MLA agreements, we have a number of different things that would impact our ability to kind of hive off assets here in the US. But I wouldn't rule it out altogether. I just would say that it's not at the top of the list ideally. Yeah, and maybe just one other thought on that as I'm thinking about it. We always talk about the disconnect, and I think the inference is always that the disconnect is that the private multiples are too high, I might flip that around and suggest that the public multiples perhaps are too low. So it's not -- when it closes, which way it closes will obviously have an impact on how you feel about that sort of an exit. Okay. Yeah. On the BTS, I think you said, if I heard you correctly, you were talking specifically about domestic builds, John? Yeah. I mean, we would like to do more of those certainly. I mean obviously you've seen our numbers over the last few years. They haven't been particularly heroic and a lot of that's because the carriers have tended to go to low-cost providers because that's a choice that they have because there's so much capital out there supporting this particular industry. So we would like to do more. We found a way to do that though is to secure high quality locations to get out ahead of where coverage needs are and secure those opportunities in more of a strategic manner as opposed to pure build astute, although we do some of those still. But yeah, I'd like to be more aggressive on it, for sure. I just don't know if we're going to get to numbers that really move the needle too much. In terms of our backlog and the fixed wireless access influence on it, it's hard for us to say exactly, because fixed wireless access is typically using the 5G oriented mid-band spectrum that is being deployed more broadly. And so I think to date, most of these fixed wireless subscribers have been supported through excess mid-band spectrum that's been deployed, capacity on that spectrum that's been deployed already but it's starting to get closer to a point where that's going to be harder to do because of the amount of consumption for that particular product. So I can't draw a direct line to it yet, but we see signs that the customer's networks are going to become more and more congested as a result of that product, and that ultimately is very good for us. Yeah it's actually Two things. It's one, they have been very active, they've probably been our most active leasing customer broadly across our international markets. But two, with the FX decline in Brazil, they are obviously a tenant there but they have a presence in a number of our other markets, so they're not as affected as some of the other carriers on that list that we share. So their percentage just by default comes up as a result of the FX shift. I mean, it could, although you're really making a little bit of a bet because if you're using the ABS market to refinance the existing ABS debt, you are using a benchmark rate that implies a certain expectation around the rate. It's not directly affected by when the Fed cuts, if they cut. So if you were to say, well, I'll hold off and take my chances and do it down the road, the revolver will be priced at a higher rate. So for the time being, you will be paying a much higher rate than you otherwise would. And so does it make sense? Plus we have other financings maturing, one big one in January and then others in January of \u201826. So you can only do that for a limited period of time. So I'm kind of inclined not to think about it that way. But the good news is, we have tremendous liquidity and we can be flexible if necessary. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I mean the conversation -- we're in regular conversations on a daily basis at all different levels with our carrier customers. And so, conversations cover a wide variety of topics and those certainly include the potential for larger, broader deals, but I wouldn't say that that is the sole focus for the time being. We're operating under the existing agreements that we have in place. We do have existing MLAs in place. Some of those involve a la carte type of arrangements, but they define those pretty well. So we continue with business as usual on that front and try to figure out where our customers could use our help the most in terms of their broader, bigger picture initiatives. And if that's best served through an MLA, we're open to that as a possibility. On the timing and the magnitude of the churn from the consolidations, it hasn't really changed too much. I think we tweaked our churn outlook in the US up just slightly, and that had to do basically with the timing of some of the Sprint churn being slightly earlier, but these are really fairly small changes in terms of the overall expectation, for instance, around Sprint. It hasn't changed from what we've given out in the past and I think was reiterated by Marc in his comments earlier today. And internationally, that's generally the case as well. The one thing that could change that is if we were to reach some sort of agreement, specifically with Claro around their Oi wireless overlap in Brazil that pulled forward or changed the timing for some of that, that could obviously have an impact. But as of today, it continues along the same path as we previously laid out. Sure. Yeah, it's -- I would say that it was across a number of our different markets. I mentioned earlier that Claro was busy. They were a big driver of that. And yeah, I can't say for sure whether it's to be sustained, but our backlogs continue to be pretty strong. And so I hope that in fact it will be. I think there's a lot to do as we look at the needs that these carriers have. It's really more of a financial question, I think, than anything else. So I think it's a good sign to see it ahead of the pace that we expected to be at, at this point. And at this point, I think that that will continue throughout the balance of the year, and we'll let you know where we are as we get into next year. I think from an operational standpoint that the scale benefits are very limited because we're pretty streamlined at this point. I think there are some certainly but I think it's relatively small part of any large scale deal that we would do here in the US. But there probably are some benefits in terms of just being able to help our customers achieve some of their broader reaching goals if we have a bigger portfolio. That does make a little bit of a difference, I think. But I don't think it's a major factor. I think ultimately they'll need the sites that they need, and we have a lot of great sites and a lot of great locations that are frankly ones that can't be duplicated. So it's something that we would think would be marginally beneficial from a strategic standpoint but marginally being the key word. Hey, Brandon. Brandon, I'm sorry. You were muffled there. I couldn't really hear what you said. Yeah, that's better. Thanks. Yeah, I can't give you next year's numbers at this point. I would tell you that from an application standpoint, we have seen increases. Each of the last couple of quarters, quarter-over-quarter, continues to go up, so that's a good sign. But an application doesn't necessarily tell the whole story because you have to see how that plays through and what's the level of equipment that they're installing and so forth. I do think with the increases that we're seeing in terms of interest and applications that we'll see an opportunity to have greater executions as we move through the year, particularly into next year. But there's so much that still has to be -- has to play out for us to know what that does to next year's number that -- it's premature for me to say. Yeah, I would say that it was broad in the sense that it was across the customers that make up that revenue base, although we do have certain concentrations. So obviously it's a greater absolute dollar amount from certain carriers. But there's nothing that stands out about that. It's really more, as I said earlier, it's really more about the mix of work being a little more SDS related instead of construction related. Sure. Sure. On DISH, there's been -- we continue to have conversations. They actually do continue to sign leases with us, but there hasn't been any material inflection in that. And we're waiting to see how their plans evolve, if they evolve. I'm sure there are conversations ongoing in terms of the deadlines around their commitments for coverage for next year, and financing, and a number of other things. But we're just here trying to be the best partner we can be to them on their needs. And they continue to sign leases in places where they need it, but it's obviously at a lower level than it was a couple of years ago. So nothing really new there. On the strategic or operational review, yeah, there's only so much I could say at this point because we've done a lot of work, but until we're ready to share with you specific takeaway, specific actions that are being taken, it would be premature for me to talk about that right now. But I do think certainly by the end of the year, I would expect that there will be a number of things that we can share. Sure. I think it will be an informed amount of risk. There's always some degree of risk, particularly when you're making decisions to invest capital and expand by buying or building new assets. So I believe that all of the learnings that we have over the years and what we've seen in each of the markets where we operate make us better informed to understand the risk that we're taking on and to manage and frankly price that in in any decisions that we make. So I don't know that it's changed a lot. I think the knowledge that we have changes every day and that informs it, but our overall risk tolerance is probably not that different, just our education is a little different. Yeah, I mean, so much of the decisions around investments in the new assets is impacted by your view of the future of those assets in the markets and what are the M&Os in those particular markets going to be doing and what are their needs going forward. And I think almost in every case, when one tower company buys a portfolio instead of another, it probably comes down typically to their view of the future. And one has maybe a slightly more favorable view than another, and therefore they are able to see their way clear to pay a little bit more. And I don't think things are any different than that today. Obviously, the cost of capital being higher makes a difference, but it's higher for everybody. And I think that's what started to normalize. It started to make its way through the system, whereas before you had certain folks who were using capital that was priced at a much lower point, and that was allowing them to continue on buying stuff at prices that were suddenly becoming not as attractive to some of us that were affected more quickly by the change in cost of capital. So I don't think it's any different. I think it's just a matter of everybody adjusting to the cost of capital and then how you see your way clear to obtain the growth necessary on the assets that you're buying. Sure. Well, they change in the sense that, at a given point in time in a given market a carrier has more or less initiatives, certain specific needs. They either have them or they don't in a given window of time. But that's not really different than the history of it. It's just as cyclical in different places. So I don't think that the conversations are necessarily that different. I think when they change more meaningfully is when there's a big initiative, a big project, a new spectrum band to roll out or a particular initiative that is carrier specific and that will lead perhaps to maybe a bigger scale agreement, that sort of thing. But the conversations inform our view on where they're going and allow us to better position ourselves in order to capture a greater percentage of the business that's going to come as a result of those initiatives. Sure. Well, yeah, I didn't say that we are definitely buying a material portfolio. I'd say that we are looking at all kinds of things that are available. And some of those include material portfolios. But whether those happen or not remains to be seen. So sometimes you have to be patient in terms of how you use your capital. We've in the past had people say, well, you must not like your stock because you didn't buy it this quarter. Well, that's not necessarily true. It depends on other things that are going on that take a lot longer than one or two months to determine how they're going to play out. So I think what you should expect is going forward, we will over time have a mix of all of these things. We will do buybacks, we will do debt paydowns, and we will also hopefully buy assets. Yeah, I think in the past when we first were entering certain of these markets, our view on scale was that scale is reaching a point that you cover your overhead and you produce positive EBITDA. And I think where our view has evolved is that scale is more than that. It's your relevance to the leading carriers in the market and if you don't have that and in particular international more than this is the case in the US internationally, if you don't have that the way that work is handed out, the way that carriers engage with providers, tower providers in this case, is influenced by the relative importance to their network that you represent. And so we have some places where we simply have small portfolios and there are much bigger players. And so we either need to figure out how to become a bigger player that's more relevant to our customers or we shouldn't be there. Sure. Sure. The opportunity for lower domestic churn, yes. I do think that excluding, of course, Sprint or any other material consolidation that might take place that we would see that number trend down over time. A lot of that was made up of stuff that was smaller companies and that kind of thing. So, I expect to see less and less of that. But we'll see as we get into next year and the years beyond. US Cellular, we have a fairly immaterial exposure. We have less than $20 million a year in revenue from US Cellular and even, obviously a smaller percentage of that overlaps with T-Mobile. So I don't think it'll be overly material, whatever happens there. And on the SG&A front, it did step down quarter over quarter, but typically the first quarter is our highest quarter because of payroll taxes and a number of other specific things. So I think we're at a fairly normal level, but over time it will probably move up with the typical cost of living type of increases that you would expect for overhead of our type. Sure. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get too specific on all that, but just to touch on the ones that you mentioned, Tanzania, thus far has worked out extremely well. We've had tremendous growth there that we've been very pleased with from an organic leasing standpoint. Obviously, the entry price we came in was attractive and so the return on investment capital thus far has been tremendous in that market. In the case of the Philippines, it was a little bit of a totally different animal. There wasn't an acquisition there. That was almost all brand new builds. And it's really at a fairly early stage. So I'd say that so far it's gone well. The leasing has been strong, but we have a very small portfolio and they're brand new sites. So we've got to give that a little bit more time to see how it plays out. Yeah, I mean, we're a macro tower company, so that's obviously we've spent the vast majority of our time. The other things were specific items that had ancillary strategic rationale that we were looking at, but it's not the core of what we look at. Sure. Thank you all for joining the call, and we look forward to reporting our results next quarter."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n And I now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead. \nMark DeRussy: Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make. \n In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Marc. \nMarc Montagner: Thank you, Mark. \n Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currency assumptions, we increased our full year outlook for tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share as compared to our initial 2024 outlook. The primary drivers of these increases are direct cost savings associated with towers to be decommissioned and a reduction in our estimated full year share count from completing share buyback. \n Due to the current strength of the U.S. dollars versus local currencies in some of our international markets, our overall outlook for site leasing revenue, total revenues, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA were slightly down versus our initial guidance. \n First quarter domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis, 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $7.5 million of the first quarter churn was related to Sprint consolidation churn, which we anticipate to be approximately $30 million for the full year 2024. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity of bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was consistent with the levels of activity we saw in 2023. \n Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in '26 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. \n International same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.3% net, including 4.8% of churn or 8.1% on a gross basis. \n In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, our reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI-linked escalator in Brazil. \n Total international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue during the quarter. \n As a reminder, our 2024 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi wireless consolidation other than the amount associated with the previously announced agreement that we executed with Vivo. If, during 2024, we were to enter into further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi wireless consolidation that may have an impact on 2024, we will adjust our outlook in future earnings calls. \n Additionally, the judicial reorganization plan for Oi wireline was recently approved by a majority of creditors. As a result of this plan, we have increased our full year churn outlook for Oi wireline by $2 million to a total of approximately $4 million. This adjustment is including the updated full year site leasing revenue outlook. As a result, all wireline now represent approximately $20 million total annual site leasing revenue in 2024. \n During this quarter of 2024, we acquired 11 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $9.2 million. We also built 76 new sites, mostly outside of the U.S. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or under agreement to purchase 271 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $84.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter. \n Our outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. We also do not assume any share buyback beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets, share repurchase or both during the year. \n Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and FFO per share continues to include the July 1 refinancing of $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October '24. We assume a refinancing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. \n Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity. If not for the recent share buyback, our $2 billion revolver would have been fully paid down. \n Our current leverage of 6.5x net debt to EBITDA remains near historical low and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5x. \n Our balance sheet is very strong with a current weighted average interest rate of 3.1% across our total outstanding debt. \n Our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years, including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 96% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\n And now I turn the call over to Mark. \nMark DeRussy: Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.2 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.5x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2x. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $195 million outstanding under our $2 billion revolver. \n During the first and second quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million at an average price per share of $213.85. We currently have $205 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2024, were 107.9 million. \n In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $108.1 million or $0.98 per share. And as of today, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share, payable on June 19, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close on May 23, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. \n The first quarter marked a good start to 2024. We executed well operationally and produced financial results in line with our expectations. As a result, we have made very few adjustments to our full year outlook on a constant currency basis. \n In many of our markets, macroeconomic challenges have continued and, as a result, incremental network investments by our customers have remained measured and largely in line with activity levels that we saw last year. \n In the U.S., leasing activity from an execution standpoint was only slightly higher than the fourth quarter. However, during the first quarter, we saw increases in applications for both new leases and amendments as well as an increase in our services backlog. \n Our customers continue to have significant network needs. A large percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades. And data-heavy use cases, including fixed wireless access, will compel continued investment by our customers over the next several years. I am personally of the belief that the current high cost of capital environment is perhaps the biggest overhang on this spending and is driving the more elongated spending cycle. \n Nonetheless, the needs are great. Consumers are demanding and competitive pressures will continue. Our infrastructure will be a critical component of the delivery chain for our customers to meet these challenges, and I believe we are well positioned to support them in their efforts. In addition, the current cost of capital may persist longer than anticipated just a few months ago, but I believe it will ultimately come down in time, which will encourage increased network investment. It is all really just a matter of timing. \n Internationally, results were also in line with expectations. Although each market has its own specific dynamics, on average, we are in a period of slower growth internationally compared to our historical levels. Lower inflationary escalators are a contributor, but the primary reason is consolidation-related churn and its associated impacts on carrier focus. \n Internationally, we have found that during these consolidations, the surviving carriers direct most of their attention to rationalizing their existing networks, causing much of their incremental network expansion. However, new spectrum and new technology generation deployments remain important and we believe will result in an acceleration in organic growth rates over time. \n As discussed on our last call, churn remains elevated due primarily to these consolidations, but we believe that the steps we have taken and are taking to reach mutually beneficial contractual amendments with these customers will enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We have not shifted our previously stated overall approach, but we do very much make adjustments along the way in response to broader market dynamics and opportunities. We prioritize our dividend and have again announced a quarterly dividend 15% higher than the prior year period. This dividend level remains less than 30% of our guided full year AFFO, leaving meaningful capital available for allocation. \n During the first quarter, we added a relatively small number of towers to our portfolio and, as a result of carrier consolidation, we decommissioned almost as many sites as we added. We remain selective about the quality of the sites that we add to our portfolio, but we really remain particular about the price at which we add them, which these days has been the main gating issue. That's okay as our focus continues to be on return on investment, not growth just for growth's sake. \n Opportunities will come along. In fact, they come along all the time. So we are comfortable being patient, appropriately considering the new cost of capital environment we are operating in and going after those opportunities that we believe we can best drive strong returns on. \n The sites we are decommissioning are related to consolidation activity among our customers. We will be more proactive in the coming years in evaluating naked sites for cost-saving opportunities and potentially decommissioning. \n As I mentioned earlier, cost of capital, and specifically cost of debt, remains high and is now broadly expected to remain elevated for longer. This dynamic beyond any other has had the most significant impact on public tower company valuations. During the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, we responded to some of this decline in valuations by spending $200 million to repurchase 935,000 shares of our stock. I believe that when there is ultimately a downward shift in rates, repurchases at this level will be even more accretive to future shareholder value. \n Nonetheless, rates remain elevated today, and we recognize the impact of potential future higher interest costs on AFFO. So a portion of our capital allocation will continue to be appropriately dedicated to reducing debt. \n We are not formally changing our leverage targets as we believe retaining flexibility for the right investment opportunities is valuable, but operating with lower leverage in the current environment is clearly prudent. \n Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. If not for the share repurchases, our revolver would have been fully paid down as of today. Our average cost of debt remains very low at 3.1%. However, over the next 12 months, we have approximately $1.8 billion that will need to be refinanced. The cost of that debt will certainly be higher than what we are paying today, but our ability to manage the amount of debt needed and the time we are locked into higher rates will be important factors in the approach we take. \n Capital is widely available to us. It's really just a matter of cost. We are evaluating a variety of options and we'll provide further updates during the year as incremental steps are taken. \n Finally, I would like to revisit some of my comments from our prior earnings call with regard to the portfolio review we have undertaken. On the last call, I mentioned that we had begun an effort to analyze all of our operations and our potential operations through a lens of stabilizing results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. I do not see this goal as having a finite deadline as it is more definitional around the key decisions we make. \n However, there are some very specific steps being taken and looking at each of our key operations, each of our business lines and each of our international markets. We are setting baselines as to where we think these operations end up on a status quo basis 1 year from now, 5 years from now and even 10 years from now. Then based on potential opportunities we see in each case, we are developing alternative results profiles based on different paths we might take, with the ultimate goal being improving the outcome relative to the base case. \n We are making good progress and gaining good insights through the effort, but this is not an overnight initiative. Many of the potential steps identified to enhance our positioning in given markets or operations will take time, sometimes possibly years, to effectuate. \n After our prior call, a lot of attention was paid to the possibility of divestitures of businesses or markets. While that may be an outcome in some cases, it is far from our priority or preferred path. I would much rather find ways to improve our position in the market through the addition of quality assets, enhance customer relationships and agreements and other creative solutions. \n In fact, I was recently visiting our team in Brazil and learned a number of creative solutions we are introducing to enhance the customer experience at our sites and thereby improve the longevity of our customer relationships at those sites. I am encouraged by the seriousness with which our teams are approaching this initiative. \n In the end though, as I stated previously, financial results always matter, and we will make the best decisions we can to protect or create shareholder value as our top priority. We have a great business and great assets. It is our job as the management team to maximize the value we can realize from those assets, and that is where our focus squarely is. \n I'd like to wrap up by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our solid first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to share our progress throughout the year. \n With that, Jeffrey, we are ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rollins. \nMichael Rollins: Curious if you could discuss a bit more about some of the preconditions you're seeing for better domestic leasing activity, the applications that you described for new leases and amendments, and does this give you encouragement that 2025 can see better leasing activity than 2024. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, Mike, I think it's a little bit premature to say that. My comments about the increased applications are obviously positive in general, as increases, obviously, would be. But I think it's a little bit early. It's only been 2 months since our last report. And we haven't seen a material change. We've just seen a minor step-up directionally in those items. So at this point, I think it's too early to comment on where 2025 will come out. \nMichael Rollins: And in terms of just where the activity is coming from, is it coalesced around certain geographies or from certain carriers? \nBrendan Cavanagh: No. I would say it's fairly broad-based. And different geographies, different carriers are perhaps a little bit busier than others. But I think you're aware of some of the initiatives that some of our customers have going on. But I would say, it's generally broad-based across the big 3 carriers. \nMichael Rollins: And just one other question. You mentioned about wanting to manage leverage lower in this environment. Do you have a goal as to where you'd like to see your net debt leverage exit the year? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We don't really have a goal. In fact, we're actually not explicitly changing our targets, although we're obviously operating well below them today. And the reason we're not changing the targets is that opportunities come along and sometimes being flexible and levering back up to take advantage of a particular opportunity may be the best choice, and so I don't want to kind of present it like we have to be the lower number. \n I think in absence of investment opportunities that we see as particularly value additive, in the current high interest rate environment, the best option in some cases will be to actually pay down absolute debt. So there's not a particular target, but I think outside of some meaningful opportunity for new assets coming along, you should expect that we would look to reduce our absolute debt levels. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin. \nJonathan Atkin: I was interested in where you see the most interesting build-to-suit opportunities across your markets. And then as we kind of think about M&A, either within existing markets or elsewhere, can you just remind us in terms of what your guidelines are and where you might be seeing opportunities? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the new build opportunities, well, first of all, we're looking in every market that we're in for specific opportunities that meet our requirements because we already have a presence in that market and an operation scalability there. So ideally, we'd like to build sites wherever we can. But specifically, certain markets, in our African markets in particular, we're seeing more opportunities and certain select markets in South America as well.\n On the M&A front, I would say the same premise applies in the sense that if we can find high-quality opportunities in any of our existing markets, that's something that we prioritize. But at the end of the day, it really is a financial analysis around the pricing of those assets and what we think we can do in terms of returns based on growth that we think we can achieve over a period typically of about 5 years or so. Our approach hasn't really changed, although our return thresholds have moved up with the cost of capital. \nJonathan Atkin: And then Brazil, can you remind us broadly where Oi is in terms of the equipment being decommissioned off of towers for their mobile network? And then prospectively, for the wireline, you gave a little bit of color in the prepared remarks, but where are they in terms of physical decommissioning as opposed to you haven't already maybe recognized it in your reporting? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. On the Oi wireless side, it varies by carrier. Obviously, they were absorbed into 3 different carriers. I don't know if I could give you an exact percentage, but they're probably 40-ish percent or so of the way through that effort would be my guess, on average. We're definitely seeing the activity there. But as we see here in the U.S., it's an elongated process and it takes some time. So I'd expect this to go on for a number of years. \n On the wireline side, we've seen some decommissionings that were really in advance of the efforts that they're undertaking here. But that one actually has the most runway still to go. They just had their reorganization plan approved just a week or so ago. So it's very early days there. But I would expect over the next couple of years, we'll start to get a better sense of that. And in fact, under the plan, they're expecting to reorganize and continue to operate that network at least for the next several years, so we'll see how that progresses in terms of how many sites actually get turned on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Elias. \nMichael Elias: First, I just want to delve back on the portfolio review. It seems like when you're talking about the M&A environment, valuation is the holdup. I think just interpretation, that's part of the reason why we're seeing you shift more capital allocation to the buyback. Just curious how your thoughts there have evolved, that would be the first thing. And then second, is there any color that you can share in terms of the 271 sites that you announced that you are acquiring, where they're located, that would be helpful. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. Yes. I would say in terms of evolution of our thinking, we announced this portfolio review publicly last quarter. And it hasn't been that much time, so we're kind of in the midst and throes of that. The one thing that has shifted a little bit, though, in that window of time is that rates are not only staying higher but are expected to continue to stay higher for longer, and that's something that we have to be sensitive to. And so my comments earlier in the prepared remarks are really about that, about the fact that we have to watch that. And in some cases, paying down debt may actually be more accretive than we would have thought even a couple of months ago. And so it's certainly on the table, perhaps more than it was before. And you're right, in that you see less M&A activity and more towards buybacks, for instance, because we see a better return there. So it is still very much financially driven. \n In terms of the sites that are under contract, it's pretty much the same sites that were under contract, with a very few exceptions, at our last earnings call. There are a mix of markets, some are here in the U.S., but most are located internationally. South America is the primary place where we have those types of contracts. \nMichael Elias: Perfect. And one other question, if I could. On the last quarter earnings call, there was commentary that carrier activity in the U.S. persisted at the current levels that you can see the 4Q '24 exit run rate be below $40 million. Just curious how you're thinking about the potential run rate exiting the year based on the activity that you're currently seeing? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. We didn't change any of our outlook for the year, so that still stands as of today that we would expect a similar number to what we talked about last time exiting the year. So right now, we haven't seen enough shift in carrier activity to change those projections. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery. \nSimon Flannery: Brendan, I wonder if you could just characterize some of the big 3 activity. Are you seeing them complete or move further on adding mid-band to existing sites? Are you seeing them move to densification? And any kind of parallels you could draw with the LTE 4G kind of phasing from that initial coverage phase to the next phase, how does this compare? Is it slower, as you noted, because of the rising rates? And perhaps you could just remind us, you talked about an uptick in applications, how should we think about timing from applications to actually execute leases and revenue generation? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean the type of activity, I would say, is a mix. There's still plenty of mid-band spectrum deployments that need to be done, particularly by AT&T and Verizon. And so we're seeing plenty of that. That's the primary driver of amendment activity. But we are seeing more new leases than perhaps we've seen in the past from the big carriers. It's a mix of both coverage and densification, but it's taking a normal transition, I think, that we've seen in previous generations of technology deployment. \n The difference really, Simon, and you touched on it, you picked up on what I said, which is it's really just timing. We're seeing this kind of go at a much slower pace perhaps than what we've seen before. That can, of course, change rapidly, but I really do believe that just the cost of money has an effect on that. And it makes total sense why our customers would be a little more disciplined in their capital spending. So that's really what we're seeing. \n And then in terms of the time frame from signing agreements or getting applications in and executing them to ultimately revenue generation, it's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. It's really just the absolute volume that's a little bit lower. \nSimon Flannery: Great. And any color you can provide on DISH? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean we're still signing some leases with DISH. Obviously, it's at a much lower level than it was when they were busier. And we're here to support them with all their needs, but I don't really have much else I can offer you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Prentiss. \nRic Prentiss: A couple of questions. One, can you unpack for us how much of the stock buyback you did within March and how much you did subsequent to the quarter? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I think it's somewhere in our report, or maybe it's not, but it will be in our 10-Q anyway. I believe roughly half, just over half, was in March and the balance was in the beginning of April. \nRic Prentiss: Sure. Okay. That helps. And then when we think about the leverage, I think the leverage went up to about 6.5 in the quarter. How should we think about stock buybacks versus allocating towards debt reductions as we look out through the rest of this year? Is 6.5 kind of the new normal in this operating environment? Do you want to go down closer to 6? Just trying to think through how buybacks are fitting in with the debt reduction absolute levels? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. It's not so much the leverage ratio. In fact, the ratio was up but the absolute amount of debt was pretty similar to what it was at year-end. It's a little bit higher because of the buybacks, but not much. It was actually higher on a leverage ratio basis because the EBITDA was down a little bit, mainly because of services. So I'm a little less focused there because we have so much room in our ratio and it's more of a focus on the absolute amount of debt that we're carrying, and specifically because we have these maturities that are coming up in the next 8 months or so. And so as I kind of eye that, our ability to kind of reduce the amount of absolute debt as we approach those maturity dates is really what we'll be targeting as opposed to worrying about where the leverage ratio is. \n And I think on the buyback front, we obviously did a couple of hundred million here, and we would be open to doing more. We've generally been opportunistic about it. But in the short term, we have these maturities and so, to some degree, that takes priority. \nRic Prentiss: Okay. And then on operational front, I think Marc M. was talking about the Sprint churn, confirming those kind of numbers. Legacy churn, non-carrier consolidation in the U.S. more than 2%. As we look out over the next 1, 2, 3 years, it seems like you might be heading to the lower end of that 1% to 2% historical level because a lot has already been maybe sucked up. Is that something that we might think of as maybe heading more towards the lower end of 1% to 2% as we look out over the next few years? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. That would be my expectation. \nRic Prentiss: Great. Very helpful. And I appreciate your clarity on the strategic review. That helps. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo. \nNicholas Del Deo: First, Brendan and Marc, you both commented on tower decommissioning as a source of cost savings and something that might tick up with the consolidation-related churn in the coming periods. Does this entail to anything different than what you have may done historically in churn, like having a lower tolerance for hanging on to naked sites? Or is it just the magnitude of the sites that may be different today versus the past? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think it's really more the latter. You've got, obviously, on the Sprint/T-Mo related consolidations here. But internationally, with the Oi consolidation in particular, I mean, those are really the big ones. There's some others here and there, but those are the biggest ones. It's a lot of sites. And so as we kind of look at what can we do in this window of time where carrier spending is a little bit slower and we have some of these headwinds, what can we do to maximize our bottom line results. Costs become a little more material potentially to that story of improvement. So it's really more the volume than it is anything else. But that increased volume requires a little bit more of a concerted direct focused effort on it. \nNicholas Del Deo: Okay. That makes sense. And then Brendan, one more for you. In your prepared remarks, you noted that your team in Brazil is taking steps to enhance I think you said the customer experience at your sites, which should be value accretive over time. Can you expand on that a bit and maybe share an example or two of what those solutions may have been? I mean it just struck me as interesting because at least those of us on the outside don't necessarily think of tower leasing as something where you tend to see a lot of innovation like that, so any description you can share would be interesting. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, I'm going to sidestep that a little bit because there are some specific things we're doing that are creative, that actually are adding value for our customers down there. Things that relate to power, that relate to other centralized hosting of wireless coverage solutions and even security-related items. As you add some of these types of things in terms of the service package that you provide, you make your site that much better. And when somebody has the choice to make the choice, you want to have your options be preferred. But it's not just that, it also comes with the ability to enter into longer-term agreements that secure that relationship for an extended period of time. And that's really what we're focusing on. \n The reason I'm sidestepping it a little bit and not getting too specific with you is that it's a little early and, for competitive reasons, I prefer not to get that specific on it. But as it becomes something that's more material, I'll be happy to share at that point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden. \nAlexander Waters: You got Alex Waters on for Dave. Maybe just first, maybe just when I think about the international churn, obviously elevated this year. I mean, Brendan, could you maybe just walk through the way we should be thinking about it for next year and the couple of years after? And then just in terms of M&A, I think we discussed a little bit about options you might have in existing markets. But can you just talk about your appetite for those that SBA does not have a presence in yet? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure, Alex. Yes, on the international churn front, I would expect that it will be elevated for the next couple of years, maybe not quite as high as it is this year, but it will be elevated by historical standards. We used to have almost 0 churn basically. But we've reached a point where you have a lot more consolidation that's taken place across many of our markets. That's driving a lot of it. And so as we just kind of look at when leases are scheduled to roll off and where there's been consolidations and what we think our exposures we might have, plus, frankly, the Oi wireline bankruptcy, those things will, I believe, cause it to stay elevated for the next several years, although, again, hopefully not quite as high as it's been this year.\n On the M&A front, yes, I mean, new markets are certainly on the table for us. We're very financially focused when evaluating the opportunities. I believe that our experience over the last decade or more of expanding into international markets has given us the comfort and the confidence that we can do that as well as anybody that we know the things that we need to understand before we enter a market, how to set up operations in a new market. So I'm confident that we can do it from an operational standpoint. \n It really just comes down to opportunity that's on the table and the price point at which we can secure it so that it is value additive ultimately for the company as a whole and for our shareholders. That's the guiding issue. And that's harder and harder these days broadly, whether it's new markets or existing markets, because there are a number of situations where I don't think seller expectations have aligned still with where the market has gone. But that could change over time and our willingness to expand in our existing markets or in new markets would remain the same. We would be open to it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Batya Levi. \nBatya Levi: A couple of follow-ups. On the network services side, can you talk a little bit about the slowdown you saw in the quarter? And I think you're tracking below your annual guidance. Should we expect this quarter to be the trough and continue to improve from here? And maybe on the tower side, can you give an update on what percent of your sites have been upgraded with 5G equipment now? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Sure. On the services business, yes, it's down a little bit. But as you saw, we did not change our full year outlook, and we do expect that the second half of the year will be slightly higher than the first half of the year. I mentioned in my comments that we saw an increase in our services backlog from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. That is supportive of that. And all those little things around applications being up, services backlog being higher, support that I think we will see a little bit more services activity in the second half of the year. But I think we'll be able to give you more clarity on that on the next call.\n On the tower side, 5G percentage, we're a little more than half now. I think we've said we were around half in the past. While we've seen some increase obviously through the first quarter with volumes being a little bit lower, it's only a little more than half. So the actual percentage that's left to be upgraded is still significant. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Choe. \nRichard Choe: I have two follow-ups also. I'm not sure if you can tell, but the new lease densification applications, are they mainly in markets where there's a significant amount of fixed wireless? \nBrendan Cavanagh: I can't tell you that for sure, Richard. But that would not be an unreasonable assumption, but I can't tell you that for sure. \nRichard Choe: Got it. And then on the decommissionings and cost savings, is there a significant delay from when the decommissions happen and when you can do the cost savings given maybe the ground leases underlying? Or can you kind of get ahead of it and kind of close that timing gap? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Well, our goal is to achieve those savings as quickly as we can. And you're right that there will be many cases where we're able to do that ahead of the decommissioning. In fact, in some cases, it would be our desire to not do the decommissioning and simply put those costs on hold to allow enough time to see what happens. So I think it will be a mix. But where we're able to do that, obviously, it accelerates our ability to generate the cost savings. So that's our first priority. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam. \nMatthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on the debt maturities, I think you talked about evaluating a variety of options in relation to that. Is there any more color you can share in terms of what's being evaluated in terms of alternative sources of capital? And is there the potential for cap recycling with where multiples and valuations are in the private markets? And then just secondarily, on the tower decommissioning, it's more of a housekeeping item, is that what's driving the boost to tower cash flow ex FX relative to the slight reduction in site leasing tied to the Oi churn? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Your second question, the answer is yes. That is the primary driver. I mean it's small dollars, obviously. You're talking about $4 million for the year, but yes, that's the driver. \n On the first question, when I talk about different options, we're mostly referring to different markets, types of debt that we might issue to refinance it. On the question about the cap recycling type of solution, at this point, I think I would defer on that. But the bottom line is we're open to looking at all the different options that are available to us, trying to find the most creative and cost-effective solutions that we can. And we'll let you know as we secure something. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow. \nEric Luebchow: Brendan, maybe you could talk a little bit about the comprehensive MLA you signed with AT&T last year. Any kind of early learnings on whether you think that's helped generate more activity on your site with that customer and whether there may be appetite for similar agreements with some of your other customers? I believe that T-Mobile had an agreement that expired relatively recently. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, it's actually been very good in the sense that I think it's kind of loosen the gears up, if you will, between the 2 companies. They have a lot of work to do, and we're a big supplier of theirs in terms of tower space. So the ability to have a much easier, free flowing kind of understood process by which we they make requests and we help satisfy those requests has been a positive. And so I think that, in and of itself, is something that we love to have with all of our customers. And I think we generally do. But with AT&T perhaps, it was the one that given that we have never really had any kind of master agreement with them, there was a little more low-hanging fruit there to address. \n In terms of the others, every agreement, I think, is very specific to the relationship with that customer and what their needs are and their existing relationship with us. So we're certainly open to master agreements. We've had them in the past with the others. In the case of the T-Mobile agreement, you mentioned that it expired, that's true, but we actually did extend it for a period of time while we kind of look at the longer-term needs for them and how we might structure something that's favorable for both companies into the future. So I think that evidences the fact that we work together well with our customers and are able to find solutions that are beneficial for both parties. \nEric Luebchow: Great. And just one follow-up from one of the earlier questions. I think you talked about getting to 1% U.S. tower churn, excluding Sprint, in the next few years. So just a glide path to get there, is that coming more from some of your smaller customers? Are you also seeing some current opportunities with the big 3 or 4 customers? Does it have anything to do with less competitive activity from tower overbuilders or anything you can cite to kind of get down to those levels? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, I think it's both. You have less smaller guys just in general. And so therefore, there's just less of a pool of potential leases to churn with the kind of more narrowband type of tenants that we have, so that is a contributor. And with the bigger guys, I think as you have these master agreements, you have less of these, as you said, over builders that are out there and others that are trying to find ways to take existing tenants. While not particularly successful in the past, there were some amount of that. I think that's sort of gone its way and you'll see less and less of that happening in general. So I believe all of those factors will play into it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Piecyk. \nWalter Piecyk: I just wanted to go back to the math on the debt reduction and the share repurchase because I think, basically, the way you described it is you noticed what was going on, longer and higher, but then you continued to buy stock back into April, which, I guess, if you could comment on that because I'm not sure how those two things fit. \n But then if you look at kind of the reduction on an empirical basis, in '23, we reduced it $600 million. Obviously, you're not on the pace of that yet this year for any reduction, but again, piecemealing, I know 3 or 4 people asked this question, you kind of referenced the $800 million of debt maturities. So if we look at you using another $100 million already in the June quarter and then just the free cash flow in advance of those maturities, it would seem to me that you basically have to turn that spigot off for any share repurchase for the remainder of the quarter and into Q3 if you're specifically targeting those maturities. \n I get it that you're looking for other ways to, I guess, refi it or whatever. So if you could just comment on why you were buying stock back when things change. Should we expect more than $600 million given the comments that you made? And how can you do share repurchase if you've got these maturities that you want to address? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I'm not sure if there's just a moment in time when things change. We bought back stock in late March and basically the first few days of April. And I think that, that still is a good return on investment. The reality, Walt, is it's hard to be that precise and exact-timing all of these things. And I think as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we won't buy stock back at all. I'm just telling you that directionally, as I look at it today, that I think paydowns of debt is slightly more accretive than buying back stock where it is right now. But that doesn't mean there won't be opportunities to do both, and I expect we will do both going forward. But we're going to see what other options we have available to us as we move through the balance of the year, and that will influence how it plays out. \nMark DeRussy: Well, I will add one thing here and that is to say buybacks have a certain mechanic to them where when we were in a blackout period, we typically put a plan in place. And those plans typically prevent us from actually making decisions. So the decisions are made ahead of time, and I think that may help explain the timing of this relative to your comments. \nWalter Piecyk: That's fine, Mark. I appreciate that. Just one follow-up though. Again, just based on math, right, this is a very predictable business, right? We can see what the free cash flow is. If you think share repurchase is more important for these reasons that you've outlined, which I don't disagree with, right, and assuming that, that view doesn't change, all of a sudden, the Fed doesn't start f***ing dropping rates left and right in the near future, again, unlikely, I just don't see how that doesn't mean that you have to mostly turn off the share repurchase spigot at least through the end of the year, like it's just the math of the free cash flow and what's available in terms of at least trying to top the $600 million reduction that you did last year. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. No, that's true. There is a certain amount of cash that's available under the current structure that we've got. We're producing a certain amount of AFFO and the proportion allocated to the dividend, and there's the rest, right? And the rest will go to one of these buckets or a mix of these buckets. So what you're saying is right. But things may adjust. Frankly, we may end up with an acquisition opportunity that we think is actually better than all, and that would put both of these things to the side. So I'm retaining some flexibility. But yes, if we're going to pay down a meaningful amount of debt, obviously, we have to stop spending on everything else. \nWalter Piecyk: Just got one last operational question. I guess I'll phrase it this way, outside of the big 3 operators and DISH, have you seen anyone demonstrating interest in or submitting applications for CBRS spectrum to deploy on your towers? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Nothing material. No, nothing really. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Nispel. \nBrandon Nispel: A quick one for Mark. Could you just quantify the impact of customer consolidation churn versus normal course churn in the quarter, both domestically and international? And maybe for Brendan, sitting here, looking at your leasing and churn numbers... \nBrendan Cavanagh: Brandon, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, you're a little garbled. You may have to repeat that first. \nBrandon Nispel: Can you hear me better now? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes, that's much better. Thanks. \nBrandon Nispel: Okay. I'll just start over. So a quick question for Mark, could you just quantify the impact of customer consolidation-driven churn domestically in internationally versus normal course churn in the quarter? \n And then, Brendan, for you with where you're sitting today from a leasing standpoint and churn standpoint, internationally and domestically, and what you know about your maturities coming up, what do you think is a reasonable level of AFFO per share growth looking out to '25 and '26 when your heaviest maturities are coming due? \nBrendan Cavanagh: On the second question, AFFO per share growth. I think, Brandon, I mean, the real trick in answering that is that interest rates and interest expense play such a big role in it. So if it weren't for that, if I could tell you exactly what it was going to cost to refinance debt and what the timing was going to be, I could answer that question with a little more precision. Obviously, we make certain assumptions internally here, but I'd rather not speculate on that. If you kind of took that away, I think, a mid-single-digit percentage growth rate for AFFO per share would be what we would achieve even with the churn, but the interest headwinds are going to be a challenge to that.\n And then the first question was the customer consolidation churn percentage, Marc? \nMarc Montagner: Yes. So domestically, Sprint was more than half of the tower churn in the U.S. Internationally, I would say that the majority was in Oi for this first quarter, but Oi is going to pick up in Brazil. So I think we said overall the Oi churn in Brazil would be about $15 million for the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch. \nBrendan Lynch: Yes, Brendan Lynch. Maybe just on the refinancings coming up this year, to what extent are you comfortable using the revolver to refinance that debt, if not longer term, at least in the in the short term? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. I mean that's one option that's obviously on the table. The advantage to it, of course, is that it would allow you to retire it quickly over time or as you could over time without having to lock into a longer-term maturity date. But the negative is that it's some of the most expensive debt that we have right now. It would be more expensive than obviously whenever we would refinance it with in a different market. So it's an option. \nBrendan Lynch: Okay. And maybe just one on the technology front. A few quarters back, you were discussing dual-band radios as a potential driver of incremental demand. Maybe just give us an update on where that stands and any other technology initiatives that your customers might be looking at that could contribute to incremental demand going forward? \nBrendan Cavanagh: Yes. Well, we saw a decent amount of deployment of dual-band radios. That certainly was a driver last year and maybe even before that. But at this stage, it seems like most of the focus is on just deploying the mid-band spectrum that they have on hand and just incremental new leases, as we talked about before, for coverage and densification. I wouldn't say that there's anything more technical than that. \nOperator: There's currently no other questions in the queue at this time. \nBrendan Cavanagh: Great. Thank you all for dialing in. We appreciate your time tonight and look forward to reporting to you next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation and using the AT&T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Marc Montagner",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. \n Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currency assumptions, we increased our full year outlook for tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share as compared to our initial 2024 outlook. The primary drivers of these increases are direct cost savings associated with towers to be decommissioned and a reduction in our estimated full year share count from completing share buyback. \n Due to the current strength of the U.S. dollars versus local currencies in some of our international markets, our overall outlook for site leasing revenue, total revenues, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA were slightly down versus our initial guidance. \n First quarter domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis, 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $7.5 million of the first quarter churn was related to Sprint consolidation churn, which we anticipate to be approximately $30 million for the full year 2024. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity of bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was consistent with the levels of activity we saw in 2023. \n Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in '26 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027. \n International same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.3% net, including 4.8% of churn or 8.1% on a gross basis. \n In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, our reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI-linked escalator in Brazil. \n Total international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue during the quarter. \n As a reminder, our 2024 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi wireless consolidation other than the amount associated with the previously announced agreement that we executed with Vivo. If, during 2024, we were to enter into further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi wireless consolidation that may have an impact on 2024, we will adjust our outlook in future earnings calls. \n Additionally, the judicial reorganization plan for Oi wireline was recently approved by a majority of creditors. As a result of this plan, we have increased our full year churn outlook for Oi wireline by $2 million to a total of approximately $4 million. This adjustment is including the updated full year site leasing revenue outlook. As a result, all wireline now represent approximately $20 million total annual site leasing revenue in 2024. \n During this quarter of 2024, we acquired 11 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $9.2 million. We also built 76 new sites, mostly outside of the U.S. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or under agreement to purchase 271 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $84.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter. \n Our outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. We also do not assume any share buyback beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets, share repurchase or both during the year. \n Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and FFO per share continues to include the July 1 refinancing of $620 million ABS Tower Securities scheduled to mature in October '24. We assume a refinancing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and timing may vary from these assumptions. \n Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity. If not for the recent share buyback, our $2 billion revolver would have been fully paid down. \n Our current leverage of 6.5x net debt to EBITDA remains near historical low and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5x. \n Our balance sheet is very strong with a current weighted average interest rate of 3.1% across our total outstanding debt. \n Our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years, including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 96% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\n And now I turn the call over to Mark. Yes. So domestically, Sprint was more than half of the tower churn in the U.S. Internationally, I would say that the majority was in Oi for this first quarter, but Oi is going to pick up in Brazil. So I think we said overall the Oi churn in Brazil would be about $15 million for the year."

            "name": "Brendan Cavanagh",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. \n The first quarter marked a good start to 2024. We executed well operationally and produced financial results in line with our expectations. As a result, we have made very few adjustments to our full year outlook on a constant currency basis. \n In many of our markets, macroeconomic challenges have continued and, as a result, incremental network investments by our customers have remained measured and largely in line with activity levels that we saw last year. \n In the U.S., leasing activity from an execution standpoint was only slightly higher than the fourth quarter. However, during the first quarter, we saw increases in applications for both new leases and amendments as well as an increase in our services backlog. \n Our customers continue to have significant network needs. A large percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades. And data-heavy use cases, including fixed wireless access, will compel continued investment by our customers over the next several years. I am personally of the belief that the current high cost of capital environment is perhaps the biggest overhang on this spending and is driving the more elongated spending cycle. \n Nonetheless, the needs are great. Consumers are demanding and competitive pressures will continue. Our infrastructure will be a critical component of the delivery chain for our customers to meet these challenges, and I believe we are well positioned to support them in their efforts. In addition, the current cost of capital may persist longer than anticipated just a few months ago, but I believe it will ultimately come down in time, which will encourage increased network investment. It is all really just a matter of timing. \n Internationally, results were also in line with expectations. Although each market has its own specific dynamics, on average, we are in a period of slower growth internationally compared to our historical levels. Lower inflationary escalators are a contributor, but the primary reason is consolidation-related churn and its associated impacts on carrier focus. \n Internationally, we have found that during these consolidations, the surviving carriers direct most of their attention to rationalizing their existing networks, causing much of their incremental network expansion. However, new spectrum and new technology generation deployments remain important and we believe will result in an acceleration in organic growth rates over time. \n As discussed on our last call, churn remains elevated due primarily to these consolidations, but we believe that the steps we have taken and are taking to reach mutually beneficial contractual amendments with these customers will enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. We have not shifted our previously stated overall approach, but we do very much make adjustments along the way in response to broader market dynamics and opportunities. We prioritize our dividend and have again announced a quarterly dividend 15% higher than the prior year period. This dividend level remains less than 30% of our guided full year AFFO, leaving meaningful capital available for allocation. \n During the first quarter, we added a relatively small number of towers to our portfolio and, as a result of carrier consolidation, we decommissioned almost as many sites as we added. We remain selective about the quality of the sites that we add to our portfolio, but we really remain particular about the price at which we add them, which these days has been the main gating issue. That's okay as our focus continues to be on return on investment, not growth just for growth's sake. \n Opportunities will come along. In fact, they come along all the time. So we are comfortable being patient, appropriately considering the new cost of capital environment we are operating in and going after those opportunities that we believe we can best drive strong returns on. \n The sites we are decommissioning are related to consolidation activity among our customers. We will be more proactive in the coming years in evaluating naked sites for cost-saving opportunities and potentially decommissioning. \n As I mentioned earlier, cost of capital, and specifically cost of debt, remains high and is now broadly expected to remain elevated for longer. This dynamic beyond any other has had the most significant impact on public tower company valuations. During the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, we responded to some of this decline in valuations by spending $200 million to repurchase 935,000 shares of our stock. I believe that when there is ultimately a downward shift in rates, repurchases at this level will be even more accretive to future shareholder value. \n Nonetheless, rates remain elevated today, and we recognize the impact of potential future higher interest costs on AFFO. So a portion of our capital allocation will continue to be appropriately dedicated to reducing debt. \n We are not formally changing our leverage targets as we believe retaining flexibility for the right investment opportunities is valuable, but operating with lower leverage in the current environment is clearly prudent. \n Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. If not for the share repurchases, our revolver would have been fully paid down as of today. Our average cost of debt remains very low at 3.1%. However, over the next 12 months, we have approximately $1.8 billion that will need to be refinanced. The cost of that debt will certainly be higher than what we are paying today, but our ability to manage the amount of debt needed and the time we are locked into higher rates will be important factors in the approach we take. \n Capital is widely available to us. It's really just a matter of cost. We are evaluating a variety of options and we'll provide further updates during the year as incremental steps are taken. \n Finally, I would like to revisit some of my comments from our prior earnings call with regard to the portfolio review we have undertaken. On the last call, I mentioned that we had begun an effort to analyze all of our operations and our potential operations through a lens of stabilizing results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. I do not see this goal as having a finite deadline as it is more definitional around the key decisions we make. \n However, there are some very specific steps being taken and looking at each of our key operations, each of our business lines and each of our international markets. We are setting baselines as to where we think these operations end up on a status quo basis 1 year from now, 5 years from now and even 10 years from now. Then based on potential opportunities we see in each case, we are developing alternative results profiles based on different paths we might take, with the ultimate goal being improving the outcome relative to the base case. \n We are making good progress and gaining good insights through the effort, but this is not an overnight initiative. Many of the potential steps identified to enhance our positioning in given markets or operations will take time, sometimes possibly years, to effectuate. \n After our prior call, a lot of attention was paid to the possibility of divestitures of businesses or markets. While that may be an outcome in some cases, it is far from our priority or preferred path. I would much rather find ways to improve our position in the market through the addition of quality assets, enhance customer relationships and agreements and other creative solutions. \n In fact, I was recently visiting our team in Brazil and learned a number of creative solutions we are introducing to enhance the customer experience at our sites and thereby improve the longevity of our customer relationships at those sites. I am encouraged by the seriousness with which our teams are approaching this initiative. \n In the end though, as I stated previously, financial results always matter, and we will make the best decisions we can to protect or create shareholder value as our top priority. We have a great business and great assets. It is our job as the management team to maximize the value we can realize from those assets, and that is where our focus squarely is. \n I'd like to wrap up by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our solid first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to share our progress throughout the year. \n With that, Jeffrey, we are ready for questions. Yes, Mike, I think it's a little bit premature to say that. My comments about the increased applications are obviously positive in general, as increases, obviously, would be. But I think it's a little bit early. It's only been 2 months since our last report. And we haven't seen a material change. We've just seen a minor step-up directionally in those items. So at this point, I think it's too early to comment on where 2025 will come out. No. I would say it's fairly broad-based. And different geographies, different carriers are perhaps a little bit busier than others. But I think you're aware of some of the initiatives that some of our customers have going on. But I would say, it's generally broad-based across the big 3 carriers. Yes. We don't really have a goal. In fact, we're actually not explicitly changing our targets, although we're obviously operating well below them today. And the reason we're not changing the targets is that opportunities come along and sometimes being flexible and levering back up to take advantage of a particular opportunity may be the best choice, and so I don't want to kind of present it like we have to be the lower number. \n I think in absence of investment opportunities that we see as particularly value additive, in the current high interest rate environment, the best option in some cases will be to actually pay down absolute debt. So there's not a particular target, but I think outside of some meaningful opportunity for new assets coming along, you should expect that we would look to reduce our absolute debt levels. Yes. On the new build opportunities, well, first of all, we're looking in every market that we're in for specific opportunities that meet our requirements because we already have a presence in that market and an operation scalability there. So ideally, we'd like to build sites wherever we can. But specifically, certain markets, in our African markets in particular, we're seeing more opportunities and certain select markets in South America as well.\n On the M&A front, I would say the same premise applies in the sense that if we can find high-quality opportunities in any of our existing markets, that's something that we prioritize. But at the end of the day, it really is a financial analysis around the pricing of those assets and what we think we can do in terms of returns based on growth that we think we can achieve over a period typically of about 5 years or so. Our approach hasn't really changed, although our return thresholds have moved up with the cost of capital. Yes. On the Oi wireless side, it varies by carrier. Obviously, they were absorbed into 3 different carriers. I don't know if I could give you an exact percentage, but they're probably 40-ish percent or so of the way through that effort would be my guess, on average. We're definitely seeing the activity there. But as we see here in the U.S., it's an elongated process and it takes some time. So I'd expect this to go on for a number of years. \n On the wireline side, we've seen some decommissionings that were really in advance of the efforts that they're undertaking here. But that one actually has the most runway still to go. They just had their reorganization plan approved just a week or so ago. So it's very early days there. But I would expect over the next couple of years, we'll start to get a better sense of that. And in fact, under the plan, they're expecting to reorganize and continue to operate that network at least for the next several years, so we'll see how that progresses in terms of how many sites actually get turned on. Sure. Yes. I would say in terms of evolution of our thinking, we announced this portfolio review publicly last quarter. And it hasn't been that much time, so we're kind of in the midst and throes of that. The one thing that has shifted a little bit, though, in that window of time is that rates are not only staying higher but are expected to continue to stay higher for longer, and that's something that we have to be sensitive to. And so my comments earlier in the prepared remarks are really about that, about the fact that we have to watch that. And in some cases, paying down debt may actually be more accretive than we would have thought even a couple of months ago. And so it's certainly on the table, perhaps more than it was before. And you're right, in that you see less M&A activity and more towards buybacks, for instance, because we see a better return there. So it is still very much financially driven. \n In terms of the sites that are under contract, it's pretty much the same sites that were under contract, with a very few exceptions, at our last earnings call. There are a mix of markets, some are here in the U.S., but most are located internationally. South America is the primary place where we have those types of contracts. Yes. We didn't change any of our outlook for the year, so that still stands as of today that we would expect a similar number to what we talked about last time exiting the year. So right now, we haven't seen enough shift in carrier activity to change those projections. Yes. I mean the type of activity, I would say, is a mix. There's still plenty of mid-band spectrum deployments that need to be done, particularly by AT&T and Verizon. And so we're seeing plenty of that. That's the primary driver of amendment activity. But we are seeing more new leases than perhaps we've seen in the past from the big carriers. It's a mix of both coverage and densification, but it's taking a normal transition, I think, that we've seen in previous generations of technology deployment. \n The difference really, Simon, and you touched on it, you picked up on what I said, which is it's really just timing. We're seeing this kind of go at a much slower pace perhaps than what we've seen before. That can, of course, change rapidly, but I really do believe that just the cost of money has an effect on that. And it makes total sense why our customers would be a little more disciplined in their capital spending. So that's really what we're seeing. \n And then in terms of the time frame from signing agreements or getting applications in and executing them to ultimately revenue generation, it's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. It's really just the absolute volume that's a little bit lower. Yes. I mean we're still signing some leases with DISH. Obviously, it's at a much lower level than it was when they were busier. And we're here to support them with all their needs, but I don't really have much else I can offer you. Yes. I think it's somewhere in our report, or maybe it's not, but it will be in our 10-Q anyway. I believe roughly half, just over half, was in March and the balance was in the beginning of April. Yes. It's not so much the leverage ratio. In fact, the ratio was up but the absolute amount of debt was pretty similar to what it was at year-end. It's a little bit higher because of the buybacks, but not much. It was actually higher on a leverage ratio basis because the EBITDA was down a little bit, mainly because of services. So I'm a little less focused there because we have so much room in our ratio and it's more of a focus on the absolute amount of debt that we're carrying, and specifically because we have these maturities that are coming up in the next 8 months or so. And so as I kind of eye that, our ability to kind of reduce the amount of absolute debt as we approach those maturity dates is really what we'll be targeting as opposed to worrying about where the leverage ratio is. \n And I think on the buyback front, we obviously did a couple of hundred million here, and we would be open to doing more. We've generally been opportunistic about it. But in the short term, we have these maturities and so, to some degree, that takes priority. Yes. That would be my expectation. Sure. Yes, I think it's really more the latter. You've got, obviously, on the Sprint/T-Mo related consolidations here. But internationally, with the Oi consolidation in particular, I mean, those are really the big ones. There's some others here and there, but those are the biggest ones. It's a lot of sites. And so as we kind of look at what can we do in this window of time where carrier spending is a little bit slower and we have some of these headwinds, what can we do to maximize our bottom line results. Costs become a little more material potentially to that story of improvement. So it's really more the volume than it is anything else. But that increased volume requires a little bit more of a concerted direct focused effort on it. Yes. Well, I'm going to sidestep that a little bit because there are some specific things we're doing that are creative, that actually are adding value for our customers down there. Things that relate to power, that relate to other centralized hosting of wireless coverage solutions and even security-related items. As you add some of these types of things in terms of the service package that you provide, you make your site that much better. And when somebody has the choice to make the choice, you want to have your options be preferred. But it's not just that, it also comes with the ability to enter into longer-term agreements that secure that relationship for an extended period of time. And that's really what we're focusing on. \n The reason I'm sidestepping it a little bit and not getting too specific with you is that it's a little early and, for competitive reasons, I prefer not to get that specific on it. But as it becomes something that's more material, I'll be happy to share at that point. Sure, Alex. Yes, on the international churn front, I would expect that it will be elevated for the next couple of years, maybe not quite as high as it is this year, but it will be elevated by historical standards. We used to have almost 0 churn basically. But we've reached a point where you have a lot more consolidation that's taken place across many of our markets. That's driving a lot of it. And so as we just kind of look at when leases are scheduled to roll off and where there's been consolidations and what we think our exposures we might have, plus, frankly, the Oi wireline bankruptcy, those things will, I believe, cause it to stay elevated for the next several years, although, again, hopefully not quite as high as it's been this year.\n On the M&A front, yes, I mean, new markets are certainly on the table for us. We're very financially focused when evaluating the opportunities. I believe that our experience over the last decade or more of expanding into international markets has given us the comfort and the confidence that we can do that as well as anybody that we know the things that we need to understand before we enter a market, how to set up operations in a new market. So I'm confident that we can do it from an operational standpoint. \n It really just comes down to opportunity that's on the table and the price point at which we can secure it so that it is value additive ultimately for the company as a whole and for our shareholders. That's the guiding issue. And that's harder and harder these days broadly, whether it's new markets or existing markets, because there are a number of situations where I don't think seller expectations have aligned still with where the market has gone. But that could change over time and our willingness to expand in our existing markets or in new markets would remain the same. We would be open to it. Sure. On the services business, yes, it's down a little bit. But as you saw, we did not change our full year outlook, and we do expect that the second half of the year will be slightly higher than the first half of the year. I mentioned in my comments that we saw an increase in our services backlog from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. That is supportive of that. And all those little things around applications being up, services backlog being higher, support that I think we will see a little bit more services activity in the second half of the year. But I think we'll be able to give you more clarity on that on the next call.\n On the tower side, 5G percentage, we're a little more than half now. I think we've said we were around half in the past. While we've seen some increase obviously through the first quarter with volumes being a little bit lower, it's only a little more than half. So the actual percentage that's left to be upgraded is still significant. I can't tell you that for sure, Richard. But that would not be an unreasonable assumption, but I can't tell you that for sure. Well, our goal is to achieve those savings as quickly as we can. And you're right that there will be many cases where we're able to do that ahead of the decommissioning. In fact, in some cases, it would be our desire to not do the decommissioning and simply put those costs on hold to allow enough time to see what happens. So I think it will be a mix. But where we're able to do that, obviously, it accelerates our ability to generate the cost savings. So that's our first priority. Your second question, the answer is yes. That is the primary driver. I mean it's small dollars, obviously. You're talking about $4 million for the year, but yes, that's the driver. \n On the first question, when I talk about different options, we're mostly referring to different markets, types of debt that we might issue to refinance it. On the question about the cap recycling type of solution, at this point, I think I would defer on that. But the bottom line is we're open to looking at all the different options that are available to us, trying to find the most creative and cost-effective solutions that we can. And we'll let you know as we secure something. Yes, it's actually been very good in the sense that I think it's kind of loosen the gears up, if you will, between the 2 companies. They have a lot of work to do, and we're a big supplier of theirs in terms of tower space. So the ability to have a much easier, free flowing kind of understood process by which we they make requests and we help satisfy those requests has been a positive. And so I think that, in and of itself, is something that we love to have with all of our customers. And I think we generally do. But with AT&T perhaps, it was the one that given that we have never really had any kind of master agreement with them, there was a little more low-hanging fruit there to address. \n In terms of the others, every agreement, I think, is very specific to the relationship with that customer and what their needs are and their existing relationship with us. So we're certainly open to master agreements. We've had them in the past with the others. In the case of the T-Mobile agreement, you mentioned that it expired, that's true, but we actually did extend it for a period of time while we kind of look at the longer-term needs for them and how we might structure something that's favorable for both companies into the future. So I think that evidences the fact that we work together well with our customers and are able to find solutions that are beneficial for both parties. Yes, I think it's both. You have less smaller guys just in general. And so therefore, there's just less of a pool of potential leases to churn with the kind of more narrowband type of tenants that we have, so that is a contributor. And with the bigger guys, I think as you have these master agreements, you have less of these, as you said, over builders that are out there and others that are trying to find ways to take existing tenants. While not particularly successful in the past, there were some amount of that. I think that's sort of gone its way and you'll see less and less of that happening in general. So I believe all of those factors will play into it. Yes. I'm not sure if there's just a moment in time when things change. We bought back stock in late March and basically the first few days of April. And I think that, that still is a good return on investment. The reality, Walt, is it's hard to be that precise and exact-timing all of these things. And I think as we go forward, it doesn't mean that we won't buy stock back at all. I'm just telling you that directionally, as I look at it today, that I think paydowns of debt is slightly more accretive than buying back stock where it is right now. But that doesn't mean there won't be opportunities to do both, and I expect we will do both going forward. But we're going to see what other options we have available to us as we move through the balance of the year, and that will influence how it plays out. Yes. No, that's true. There is a certain amount of cash that's available under the current structure that we've got. We're producing a certain amount of AFFO and the proportion allocated to the dividend, and there's the rest, right? And the rest will go to one of these buckets or a mix of these buckets. So what you're saying is right. But things may adjust. Frankly, we may end up with an acquisition opportunity that we think is actually better than all, and that would put both of these things to the side. So I'm retaining some flexibility. But yes, if we're going to pay down a meaningful amount of debt, obviously, we have to stop spending on everything else. Nothing material. No, nothing really. Brandon, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're having a little bit of a hard time hearing you, you're a little garbled. You may have to repeat that first. Yes, that's much better. Thanks. On the second question, AFFO per share growth. I think, Brandon, I mean, the real trick in answering that is that interest rates and interest expense play such a big role in it. So if it weren't for that, if I could tell you exactly what it was going to cost to refinance debt and what the timing was going to be, I could answer that question with a little more precision. Obviously, we make certain assumptions internally here, but I'd rather not speculate on that. If you kind of took that away, I think, a mid-single-digit percentage growth rate for AFFO per share would be what we would achieve even with the churn, but the interest headwinds are going to be a challenge to that.\n And then the first question was the customer consolidation churn percentage, Marc? Yes. I mean that's one option that's obviously on the table. The advantage to it, of course, is that it would allow you to retire it quickly over time or as you could over time without having to lock into a longer-term maturity date. But the negative is that it's some of the most expensive debt that we have right now. It would be more expensive than obviously whenever we would refinance it with in a different market. So it's an option. Yes. Well, we saw a decent amount of deployment of dual-band radios. That certainly was a driver last year and maybe even before that. But at this stage, it seems like most of the focus is on just deploying the mid-band spectrum that they have on hand and just incremental new leases, as we talked about before, for coverage and densification. I wouldn't say that there's anything more technical than that. Great. Thank you all for dialing in. We appreciate your time tonight and look forward to reporting to you next quarter."
