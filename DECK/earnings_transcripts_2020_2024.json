As our fiscal year 2020 came to an end, communities around the world were experiencing impacts from the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of the Deckers organization, I'd like to extend our thoughts to everyone affected by the virus and share our deepest gratitude to all the individuals on the frontlines of this crisis, especially the healthcare workers and first responders. I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their efforts during this unprecedented time. The entire Deckers organization understands that this is a very difficult time for many people. I'm proud of how our employees and brands have risen to the occasion to serve communities in need through programs such as our better together initiative that we launched to support COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. Through monetary contributions, we're working to support small businesses in our communities and the individuals they employ. In addition, our brands are contributing in kind donations of product. To-date we've donated over 10,000 pairs of shoes to first responders and essential workers. At Deckers, we believe doing good is essential to the success of our employees, brands and organization as a whole. We'll continue to do our part and supporting those in need through these trying times. We're all in this together. Given the extraordinary circumstances, today's dialog is going to follow different structure than our past earnings calls. To outline, I'll begin with a discussion on how we're responding to and navigating through the crisis. Then give an update on the status of our operations, as well as walk through some of the trends we're seeing in the business through the first half of our first quarter. And finish with a condensed overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 performance, which will include some details on the pandemic\u2019s effects in our business in the fourth quarter. Steve will then review the numbers in more detail and expand on some of our COVID-19 related action items. After that, we'll be happy to take questions. From a business perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have widespread effects across our entire industry. However, I believe Deckers is well positioned to weather these impacts with the foundation of the organization we have created over the past three years. We have built a resilient portfolio of healthy brands, delivered levels of operating profit that are top tier among our peer group and most importantly, we maintained a robust liquidity position of over $1 billion between our cash balance and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As we plan for fiscal year 2021 and beyond, our leadership team is focused on protecting the progress we made in our brands, as well as our position as a best-in-class organization. We've developed numerous scenarios in evaluating the pandemic\u2019s potential impact on our business with an eye on the timing of when the consumer re-emerges into what we would call the new normal. Our scenario planning has produced action plans intended to mitigate related headwinds, while at the same time, comparing us to the future state of business, representing our brands to deliver a compelling experience and what we anticipate will be a much different consumer landscape and selling environment. With that in mind, we've taken the following actions to empower the Deckers organization to emerge stronger exiting the pandemic, including protecting our brands; maintaining the effectiveness of our organization and preserving our strong liquidity position; reallocating marketing spend to prioritize digital growth, while supporting strategic areas of brand level investment; and adjusting inventory buys to reflect more conservative scenarios of consumer demand with a focus on skew productivity and high velocity product turns; and learning from new ways of working, including working remotely and leveraging technology. In addition to these actions, we are holding frequent discussions with our wholesale partners as we work in tandem to support the health of our brands. We continue to monitor updates from health officials, expert agencies and local authorities to inform our decision making process. Steve will provide more details later in the call on how these actions inform our fiscal 2021 planning. From an operations perspective, our Marina Valley Distribution Center has continued to operate since reopening. This DC is operating at a modified and slightly limited capacity due to increased social distancing measures taken as a precaution to maintain employee safety. The safety of our employees is our top consideration as we make adjustments to our operations. As a result, we may experience some challenges as we approach peak months of shipping late in our second quarter and early in the third quarter. These are all factors relevant to our scenario planning. We are also making adjustments to the operations of our retail store fleet to appropriately accommodate updated health and safety measures in order to protect our retail store employees, as well as our customers visiting our physical locations. We are intentionally reopening at a measured pace and using the early learnings to shape our broader go forward strategy. Our direct to consumer leadership is empowering retail associates with educational tools and training related to the new working environment. With the small number of doors that we have reopened, we are encouraged to see consumers actively reengaging with the UGG brand stores. In terms of stores opened versus closed as of this week by region; about 20% of North America stores are open and operating in a very limited capacity; roughly half of our EMEA stores are open; approximately 20% of our stores in Japan are open; and all of our owned retail stores in China are open. Though, a portion of our stores have opened across the globe. most of them are closed for the majority of the 45-day period I'll be outlining momentarily. We'll continue to adjust store openings, as well as our warehouse operations based on the guidance provided by health officials, expert agencies, as well as federal, state and local officials. From a sourcing standpoint, we have a network of financially strong and well managed strategic partners, from material vendors to factories. With the help of our sourcing and material teams, we have worked closely with our strategic partners to ramp up quickly after the COVID-19 related closures. At this point, we do not have any major concerns from a sourcing perspective. From an employee standpoint, across North America, Europe and Japan, our corporate teams have temporarily transitioned to a work from home environment where possible by defined rules. I'm pleased with how our employees have stepped up and proven to be highly productive in this new and dynamic environment. We'll look to health officials, expert agencies and local authorities, to identify both the timing of when to return to offices and what adjustments will be necessary to provide a safe space, including the appropriate social distancing measures. I'll now walk through our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance to-date as compared to last year, which includes April 1st through May 15th. While these trends relates to what we are currently experiencing, due to historical seasonality of our business, this time period only represents roughly 5% of our annual sales volume. And thus, is not necessarily indicative of the dynamics that we anticipate for future periods. On that note, as we move later into the first quarter, our business becomes more wholesale weighted and marketplace dynamics for the upcoming months remain fluid. Overall, the business is trending down single digits quarter to date as compared to last year, with wholesale trending down in the mid-30% range and direct to consumer trending up in the high 40% range. Wholesale trends are being driven by store closures as many wholesalers are not taking new shipments of product while stores remain closed. We've remained in close contact with our wholesale partners as we work together to support our brands. Our brands are experiencing different impacts from the current wholesale environment. And this is the low period of volume for UGG and Koolaburra, while our HOKA ONE ONE brand is spread more evenly throughout the year. For Hoka, we've made adjustments to our product launches and inventory purchasing, to better allow our wholesale partners to capture consumer demand with existing inventory as they\u2019re able to reopen stores and work to best leverage our online presence. For our direct-to-consumer business, as I mentioned, the majority of our 145 stores remain closed but we're seeing triple digit e-commerce growth, driven by full price selling at both UGG and HOKA, helping to offset some of the volume loss from retail. I would note that the first quarter is traditionally a lowest period of direct-to-consumer volume, and the mix of HOKA e-commerce is disproportionately larger than in total DC volume than in other quarters. We've been very encouraged by the consistently strong interest in our UGG and HOKA brands, as evidenced by Google Trends over the last two months. With UGG search interest up 73% over the last year and HOKA search interest growth being second highest among peer brands. We think this speaks well to the power of our brands, that consumers are actively searching and buying our products during a historically low period of consumer demand. We're also experiencing a substantial gain in new customer acquisition online, which has been great news as we know that customers entering our online database have a higher lifetime value and purchase frequency than those purchasing in stores. We're especially excited about UGG customer acquisitions as this is typically a lower volume period for the brand. And our strategy aims to convert these new customers into repeat purchases down the road in the holiday period. I would like to caution though, as we move into the second and third quarters, retail volume typically becomes more impactful to our overall results. And we do not expect e-commerce to fully capture lost retail sales volume in the event that stores remain closed or limited in operation. From a global brand perspective, our quarter-to-date performance by brand across all channels, compared to last year through May 15th include, UGG down mid-single-digits due to lower wholesale shipments, resulting from doors remaining shut, as well as the impact of our owned retail store closures. However, we are very encouraged to see the pent up demand being captured through our e-commerce channel. HOKA up in the low 30% range, and now 45 days in the small portion of the full year, we are going to continue filling the brand with a goal of sustaining growth above fiscal 2020. And Teva and Sanuk down in the low 40% and mid 30% ranges respectively, as these brands are experiencing a heavier impact due to the seasonality of their businesses, with Koolaburra representing an immaterial volume during this period of year. While we feel positive about the trends we're seeing in the business, there's still plenty of hurdles to overcome in a challenged consumer environment with social distancing practices in place and recessionary concerns that could pressure discretionary spending. Moving into our discussion on fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 performance. Revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was down 5% versus last year to $375 million with the shortfall driven by an approximate $25 million headwind from unforeseen COVID-19 impacts. As a reminder, we provided fourth quarter guidance on January 30th. And at that time, we had only anticipated preliminary estimates of COVID-19 impacts on our China business. To provide a little more color on how our performance was impacted by this event in the fourth quarter, our prior guidance anticipated China headwinds of approximately $5 million for the quarter compared to last year, mostly driven by store closures and our performance aligned with this expectation. As the pandemic spread to Europe, we saw significant deterioration of the quarter-to-date growth rate trend in the region, shifting from over 20% over last year at the end of February to just 6% over last year at the end of March. As the United States shutdown in mid-March, we have been trending around 3% over last year through March 15th and saw this decline to 8% below last year by the end of March, with combined impact of retail store closures, as well as reduced wholesale shipments. Despite the fourth quarter impacts, full year fiscal 2020 performance remained strong as revenue grew by 6% versus the prior year to $2.133 billion and earnings per share increased 9% versus the prior year to $9.62. Deckers\u2019 fiscal year 2020 performance is a result of having great brands that have built lasting relationships with consumers and continue to build awareness and momentum through targeted focused investments, complemented by a disciplined approach to managing expenses. Turning to the brand highlights during fiscal year 2020, starting with the fashion and lifestyle group, which is comprised of our UGG and Koolaburra brand. For full year fiscal 2020, global UGG sales declined by 1% versus last year to $1.521 billion. Considering lost revenue on Q4 due to COVID-19, UGG would have been roughly flat last year, which is inclusive of a large headwind related to the European marketplace reset in progress. In contrast to the headwinds of the brands and international businesses, UGG grew by 5% in the United States for the second consecutive year. The UGG brand strength in the U.S. has been driven by; high levels of brand heat through PR and targeted marketing investments; driving brand search interest up 8% as compared to last year; winning with younger consumers as DTC purchasers aged 18 to 34 increased by 29% versus last year; increased loyalty membership and purchasing as enrollment in UGG rewards increased 60% and revenue from members grew 19% as compared to last year. with members spending more on average; and a diversified product mix as the Fluff Yeah and Neumel franchises, both drove significant growth. We'll look to build on the strength of our domestic business, as we whether the evolving economic and retail landscape in fiscal 2021, and look to capitalize on the brand strength as work from home becomes a new normal for many of our consumers. The UGG team has made compelling progress in the brand's domestic business over the past three years, and is focused on protecting the brand sanctity that they worked so hard to build. Moving to Koolaburra, global revenue in fiscal year 2020 grew by 58% versus last year to $70 million. The Koolaburra brand\u2019s performance was fueled by another year of strong full price sell through and market share gains within the domestics family value channel. Koolaburra also experienced success with its licensed home business, and has plans to expand to licensed lounge wear this fall in an effort to further extend the brand's lifestyle appeal. Given the value proposition of the brand, we believe Koolaburra will be poised to capture demand from budget conscious consumers in the coming year. Moving to the performance lifestyle group, which comprised of the HOKA, Teva and Sanuk brands. Starting with HOKA, global revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by 58% versus last year to $353 million. The HOKA brand far outperformed our expectations from the outset of this year. HOKA growth has been consistently balanced across the globe in the brands domestic and international businesses, and across both wholesale and direct to consumer channels. This balance has been achieved due to the team's dedication to what we refer to as the HOKA ecosystem, which provides a universally elevated consumer experience across all regions and channels of distribution. Leveraging the organizational expertise that exists in a multi-brand portfolio, the HOKA brand has quickly evolved its digital presence to become a core strength and represent the ultimate access point of the brand. HOKA digital has become a serious driver of both customer retention and new customer acquisition. Both retained and acquiring customers nearly doubled year-over-year in the HOKA brand\u2019s global direct to consumer business. The HOKA brand success in fiscal year 2020 is a result of great heritage products, new product innovation and continuing refinements of the HOKA ecosystem attracting new consumers. HOKA has significant momentum. And while broader market trends may limit the brand\u2019s incredible growth rate in fiscal year 2021, we're going to continue investing in HOKA to fuel our brand and consumer informed marketplace strategy. Turning to our Teva and Sanuk brand. Global revenue in fiscal year 2020 was $138 million and $51 million respectively. Both the Teva and Sanuk brands are attracting consumers with innovative product introductions that feature sustainability stories. This includes Teva's Strap in to Freedom campaign, highlighting new use of recycled materials now on nearly all the original sandal straps. Similarly, Sanuk continues to operate eco-friendly options, including their [Bead-in] collection. To amplify these efforts and embrace the ever changing serve specialty space, the Sanuk brand has recently streamlined operations to work directly with our internal innovation department, known as Deckers labs. By collaborating directly with Deckers labs, recreating cost efficiencies in the business, while also reinvigorating the Sanuk brand innovation engine. With respect to channel performance, global wholesale sales increased 7% for the full fiscal year. Fiscal 2020 performance was driven primarily by domestic strength in the HOKA, UGG and Koolaburra brands. Domestic wholesale has now grown over 9% for two consecutive years based on the strength of these brands. For the year, international wholesale increased low single-digits due to HOKA brand\u2019s expansion, being partially offset by the ongoing European reset of the UGG brand that is similar to the strategy we successfully implemented in the UGG brand\u2019s domestic wholesale marketplace. We also experienced negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. Global direct-to-consumer sales increased 3% for the full fiscal year, comparable sales for full fiscal year increased 5% versus the prior year. Please note that our GDV comp for fiscal 2020 has been adjusted to exclude the final weeks of March retail volume as a result of COVID-19. For the full year, DTC performance was driven by global growth of the HOKA brand, as the brand nearly doubled its e-commerce volume year-over-year and domestic strength of the UGG brand online. We've been intensely focused on enhancing the adoption of our brands online over the past few years, and this will be a primary focus in fiscal 2021 with the disruption of the retail landscape. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, as well as some additional thoughts on fiscal 2021.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Before we jump into our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results, as well as an overview of our approach to managing the business in this unprecedented environment, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strategies we've implemented over the past few years. The actions we've taken have built a more efficient business and created a strong framework and solid footing to navigate the current uncertainty. More specifically, we've implemented the UGG domestic wholesale marketplace management strategy; reducing the risk of excess inventory in the wholesale marketplace and lowering the risk of default with a smaller and healthier account base; built a strong partnership for the HOKA brand in the run specialty channel, driving awareness and customer affinity, while also capturing accelerated demand through direct-to-consumer; invested in digital infrastructure and marketing for all our brands to deliver a compelling consumer experience; shifted cost structure by reducing fixed costs and investing in variable categories; consolidated our factory base to work with financially strong partners with diversified operations outside of China; and made a targeted improvement to Teva and Sanuk profitability. The flexibility of our operating model is serving us well during these challenging times, allowing us to effectively navigate the current environment. We believe that our past and ongoing efforts provide the foundation to proactively manage through the COVID-19 disruption. We're working from a relative position of strength as compared to our peers due to the significant operating enhancements we've made over the past few years. Our actions drove improvements of over 600 basis points to our non-GAAP operating margin as compared to fiscal 2017, and more than doubled cash and equivalents to $649 million at the end of our year fiscal 2020. Now moving to our results. While we ended the year with revenue slightly below our January guidance, the main driver of the shortfall was the impact of the global pandemic in the final weeks of March. Despite these headwinds, Deckers still delivered a third consecutive full year of mid-single-digit revenue growth and top tier operating margins among peers. Our full year fiscal 2020 revenue came in at $2.133 billion, representing growth of 5.6% over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew by 6.5% as compared to last year. The HOKA brand contributed the majority of the year-over-year increase, up $129 million with Koolaburra contributing an incremental $26 million over last year with Sanuk and UGG revenue offsetting some of the gains. Absent fourth quarter impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe UGG revenue would have been roughly flat to last year. Additionally, with the results achieved, UGG brand revenue in the year was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Overall, these results were below the high-end of our guidance range by $27 million, with fourth quarter revenue coming in at $375 million, down 4.9% from last year. The lower than expected revenue was predominantly driven by approximately $25 million headwind related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These headwinds were driven by approximately $20 million related to wholesale shipments as the final two weeks of March typically include high volume shipping of spring summer product, and we experienced disruption from both the temporary closure of our West Coast distribution center, as well as wholesale partners closing stores. And $5 million in loss direct-to-consumer sales as we closed the majority of our retail locations in mid-March. Gross margins for the full fiscal year was 51.8%, up 26 basis points to last year. The increase in gross margin was driven by margin expansion in our performance lifestyle group brands, lower UGG domestic wholesale promotional activity and less close out volume, partially offset by negative currency pressure from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, increased UGG brand promotional activity outside of the U.S. and channel mix headwinds due to wholesale dollar growth outpacing DTC. This result includes the strong performance of gross margins in the fourth quarter, which came in slightly above our implied guidance of 51.5% with outperformance largely driven by gains in our performance lifestyle group. From an expense standpoint, our full year spend was up 7.4% to $765.5 million compared to last year's GAAP spend of $712.9 million, and up 7.3% to last year's non-GAAP spend of $713.3 million. As a percentage of sales, expenses de-levered against the prior year, which was aligned with our guidance as we executed reinvestment plans behind our key initiatives, including investments in marketing to drive brand heat and awareness in HOKA, UGG men and UGG women's non-core styles, building our technology, tools and talent base to advance analytical capabilities and drive efficiencies in how we connect with consumers and using innovation to develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio. These results are inclusive of actions we were able to take during the fourth quarter in conjunction with the lower revenue we were experiencing. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we benefited from the reversal of accruals related to performance-based compensation, as well as a lower tax expense resulting from jurisdictional mix and timing of certain tax items. Our effective tax rate for the year was 19%, which was largely benefited from a state refund and other onetime discrete items, which compares favorably to 19.6% in the previous year. The impact of these results drove earnings per share of $0.57 in the fourth quarter, ultimately delivering a full year fiscal 2020 earnings per share of $9.62, which compares to last year's $8.84 and our guidance range of $9.40 to $9.50. The $0.78 increase to last year was driven by higher sales and profitability in the performance lifestyle group and the fashion lifestyle group's domestic business, and benefits of share repurchases, interest income and the lower tax rate, with offsets coming from lower sales of UGG internationally due to the ongoing marketplace reset in EMEA and higher spend related to investment behind building technology tools and the talent base to advance our analytical capabilities. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2020, we ended fiscal 2020 with $649 million in cash compared to $590 million cash last year, with additional availability of $469 million to borrow on existing lines of credit. Inventories were up 11.8% at $312 million compared to last year at $279 million. Note that inventory growth over last year would have been below the rate of sales growth if not for the revenue impacts experienced in the fourth quarter due to COVID-19. And in looking at our inventory position, we are comfortable with the quality of our inventory on hand as the high proportion represents core product with low levels of markdown risk. During the fiscal year, we repurchased $190 million worth of shares. But as we did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter, we still have $160 million remaining authorized for repurchase as of March 31, 2020. And with the current near term uncertainty and emphasis on liquidity and cash management, we've decided to pause any share repurchase activity for the time being. Although, we may commence share repurchase in future periods as we deem appropriate. And for the year, these results once again returned invested capital above 20%. Switching gears to our global backlog, which includes bulk orders and represents an order book snapshot as of March 31, 2020. Backlog was up 4.6% versus the prior year at March 31, 2019. Given the current state of the economy, we do not believe backlog represents a true indicator of performance, and we are not planning our business based on backlog. Subsequent to March 31st, we have experienced some cancellations related to COVID-19 disruption. As a result, our total backlog as of mid-May, inclusive of all brands, has declined to be roughly flat as compared to last year. While we haven't seen a large amount of cancellations to date, we anticipate there will be additional cancellations and thus, are taking a cautious approach in planning the back half of fiscal year 2021. Overall, we are forecasting cancellations to outweigh reorders, the backlog does not include any indication of direct-to-consumer expectations. And as mentioned earlier, the retail environment remains unclear. Finally moving on to our forward looking expectation for fiscal year 2021. Given the ongoing and fluid economic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not be providing specific guidance for full fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will outline the major themes and how we are managing the business in these uncertain times. While we are not providing guidance, we are approaching fiscal year 2021 with the expectation that total revenue will decline year-over-year, but we believe the HOKA brand will still experience some growth, albeit at a rate lower than we've seen in our first quarter to date trend. The fashion lifestyle group will face headwinds related to the continued international softness and wholesale cancellations. Inventory levels will be elevated as we carry core product from spring and summer season disruption, as well as delay product launches to protect the health of our brand. And expenses will be tightly managed as we look to conserve our cash balance. As Dave mentioned, we've already taken some actions to reduce expense in fiscal year 2021. But we've also developed a number of scenarios to adjust spending based on the timing of expected economic recovery and our operational performance along the way. We have had meaningful discussions with our key wholesale partners to help inform our partnership in planning inventory buys and peak season volume. We believe a conservative approach in fiscal year 2021 will set up a strong return to our operating model in year fiscal 2022. Prior to the spread of the pandemic, we have been planning a continuation of our operating model, which included increased investments in our key initiatives to drive further top-line growth. Now that we are operating in a much different climate, we've reduced planned expenses related to our priorities expectation of revenue growth, and plan to redeploy a portion of our existing expense base to areas with the highest return. More specifically, some of the adjustments that we've made, include reducing costs associated with travel and brand conferences; reducing SKU complexity with an edit to amplify strategy that drives savings in our supply chain; finding efficiencies in the workforce, including the implementation of a hiring freeze and foregoing merit increases; savings related to store closures and operating stores in a more limited capacity; and reducing or eliminating other discretionary expenditures. These adjustments give us the ability to dial up or back the planned marketing investments aimed at fueling global HOKA momentum, depending on the curve of economic recovery. Our focus is to preserve the sanctity of our brands, as well as the organizations we've built to support our strong operating model. This operating model is what allows us to make better decisions with an offense focused mindset, and will ultimately establish the foundation for success on the other side of this pandemic. With our healthy cash position of $649 million that includes no debt under our credit facilities as of March 31 2020 and $469 million available on our existing lines of credit, Deckers is in a competitive liquidity position and is poised to combat the economic pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus is to make disciplined financial decisions in the best interest of the organization, while protecting the momentum and health of our brands. We are taking steps designed to put the company in a position to emerge from this crisis with a healthy balance sheet, including a strong cash position with the following considerations in mind; a current pause on share repurchase and disciplined inventory management, all paired with a focused investment in key drivers to ensure we capture demand where possible, ultimately emerging with continued strong brand positioning. Again, I'd like to reiterate that with healthy and in-demand brands, we are in a position to play offense and build on the momentum of our brands. Over the past few years, we've demonstrated the ability to course correct where necessary, and our fiscal year 2021 will be no different. As we execute our strategies, we may experience some short-term pressures on operating margins. But it is our belief that this strategy will best enable our brands to emerge stronger as we move beyond this crisis. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thank you, Steve. As I reflect on the year's performance, my key takeaway is recognizing the strength of our brand, along with an appreciation for their commitment to staying purpose driven. The power of each brand lies within the authentic connections they forge with their respective consumer base. Each of our brands remains open for business and are here to serve consumers during this uncertain time. Special thanks to our employees in the frontline, including our warehouse teams, retail associates and customer service agents, who continue to deliver and serve our customers in these extraordinary circumstances. As we look towards adapting operations to endure the near-term challenges, we're doing so with our sights on the future. We are evaluating our business strategically and intend to emerge from this pandemic with new opportunities and additional strength in the Deckers portfolio. As we navigate forward, I am confident that the Deckers organization will embrace challenges, adopting new ways to collaborate, thrive and inspire each other, as we build in our foundation to become stronger. Through it all, we will develop ways to improve our business, including innovations within our planning, production and the delivery of compelling product to the market. As we evolve these operations, we\u2019ll be mindful to preserve the progress we've made and we\u2019ll stay true to their underlying strategy. The Deckers organization will overcome near-term hurdles, while setting our sights on the goal of emerging stronger. With that in mind, we will continue to fuel the HOKA brand with digital marketing campaigns and virtual touchpoints to engage with consumers; focus on what matters in UGG, leaning into key styles and protecting marketplace management progress; enhance our e-commerce capabilities and digital presence in the omni-channel atmosphere, as we look to accelerate even faster during and beyond this crisis; and stay true to the Deckers spirit becoming better together as we evolve and innovate in the face of challenge, looking to continually develop and improve our operations and community. Overall, in the current environment, our company, brand and balance sheet are well positioned. We will manage the business with a high level of flexibility throughout the rest of the year. Thank you to all of our stakeholders. On behalf of the entire organization, I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these times. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Jonathan Komp with Robert Baird.\nJonathan Komp: I wanted to maybe just start off, broader question on the wholesale environment and you shared some detail there. I just want to get a sense of your handle on the state of things, inventory and even some of the discussion about orders, trends that you're expecting. Just any way to frame up the range of variants or any other color that you can give as you think about the balance of the year on the wholesale side?\nDave Powers: First of all, I also want to say, hope everybody on the call is safe and healthy with their families, and appreciate everybody listening in. We are and we have since over the last few years built very, very strong relationships with our key wholesale partners. And I will say the teams on a weekly if not daily basis are having conversations with these partners to navigate through this what\u2019s happening in the business now. As you heard on the call, the script, the wholesale business right now is actually performing very well from a sell through perspective, and the order book is holding pretty well for the back half of the year. And what we're hearing from our wholesale partners from an UGG perspective is they're still confident that UGG is going to be a key brand for them in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve heard that they need to be successful in the holiday timeframe as we all know. And the current trend is happening with Fluff Yeah program, Flipper and Neumel things are progressing well. So certainly there's challenges with store opening, but we are seeing in our business and also some of our key partners, very strong uptick in e-commerce, which is making up some of that loss in stores. And I think with stores opening hopefully here and key partners over the coming months, we'll see some improvements there. So the outlook right now seems very, very good confident about it. We're hearing from our partners that UGG is going to be a key brand in their portfolio for the rest of the year. They are making cuts and so we are just being mindful of that and monitoring it. But so far the first five or six weeks into the quarter, I think they\u2019re [indiscernible] nicely for UGG and then same with HOKA. I think what we're finding is both HOKA and UGG are proving to be really important brand for consumers right now. UGG on the work from home comfort, lifestyle perspective, it's nice to know that when people think of comfort and home and casual, they do think of UGG first and foremost. And then a lot of consumers, as you all know, are doing home workouts and trying to exercise more. And so that trend is also continuing to keep HOKA as a critical brand. And I think you\u2019ve seen that in the Google Trends data that came out that we referenced in the script. The brands are demand. We\u2019re challenged with wholesale store openings at our own store openings. But we think the outlook where we stand today looks good.\nSteve Fasching: And just to add on to that a little bit, because I think you were referencing, where we gave the quarter-to-date update and talked about wholesale being down kind of mid-30%, that's really because stores are still close. So with wholesalers that have a strong online presence, they are doing well and sell through is doing well and that's what we're seeing, that's where we're also seeing a strong e-commerce business on our side. So more so what we're seeing is the result of the wholesale being down is still stores being close with our wholesale accounts, but those that are doing business online are actually doing very well and sell through as well.\nDave Powers: Yes, and I think it\u2019s key to understand this is a smaller portion of our total year. And so while the trends right now look good, especially in the context of the situation we're all in, it\u2019s promising we have a long way to go. We don't know yet of reward we were going to get as wholesale is continuing to manage tightly over there.\nJonathan Komp: And then just a follow-up on HOKA and the kind of directional color around the growth you're expecting this year. Could you just expand a little bit more on the drivers that you see? I know you talked about pulling back on some of the launches, but maybe maintaining flexibility on marketing. And I know you have some new apparel product, limited portion in the marketplace. So maybe just comment a little bit more on the drivers you see there?\nDave Powers: Yes, I think it\u2019s a couple of things that are happening for HOKA. One of the things we wanted to do, first and foremost, we want to protect the positioning and the strength and the distribution that Erinn has built over the last three or four years. That is first and foremost. We see HOKA being around for a long time, being very important brand in the industry for a long time. And we're taking a long range approach to this. So what the team did is pushed out some of the launches of products where that has allowed for our partners and our sales to sell through inventory products that\u2019s already in the pipeline at full price. If you've been paying attention to the HOKA brand that are on the marketplace you will see there\u2019s little to no discounting on the brand, that's because we managed inventory tightly. There's no reason to just kind of because it\u2019s selling through well the margins are high and our partners are benefiting from that high average retail and margin. And then staggering some of the lunches throughout the year to be in line with where the demand is and the inventory level. The whole ecosystem, which is what we like to call, the combination of strategic partners in our online business is performing very well. And we're driving more business to our e-commerce site which is great because we're acquiring more consumers and that's driving up margins a little bit in short-term right now as well. So still optimistic, we know this is going to be a headwind for the brands. But right now full price selling is strong. We still see this as a growth brand, even though this year will be challenging and getting back to high level of growth coming from '22 and beyond. So the goal is protect the brands, maintain tight distribution, maintain full price selling, more of a pull model from consumers and continue to do that with powerful launches. And we have some great innovative launches coming through in the next eight to 10 months.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.\nJim Duffy: To start Dave, I wanted to ask, a few times in your prepared remarks, you mentioned planning for a new normal and future state of the business. Can you share in the post pandemic world and maybe how you're thinking about the new normal and future state of the business, specifically for the UGG brands and some of the things you're doing to prepare for that?\nDave Powers: Yes, you know we had a lot of conversations just around that what is the new normal. I think they're just trying to figure that out. And for us, there's a couple things. From a employee standpoint, we are seeing some positive results from the work from home scenario or situation, both in the ability to stay connected and make decisions faster, which I think is great and then beneficial to the team and also allows us to be more efficient in our spend and reduce travel. So there has been from an operation and employee workforce perspective that we will probably continue in the long-term, leveraging technology to reduce travel, using 3D and imaging for our failed samples and reducing cost there. There's a lot of good benefits. The things that we knew and we're working on but we've had the opportunity right now through technology to accelerate some of those things. From a business standpoint, like we've been saying for the last two years now, we see a handful of really strong strategic wholesale partners, leveraging them to access to consumer and across the different demographics of our consumer base and that's emerging, and then really continuing to fill our DTC business. And so we've shifted pretty dramatically the marketing efforts to be much more in tuned with what's happening in the consumer now. We're using a lot more user generated content, leveraging in TR and we're getting fantastic response to that. So I think you're going to see a shift to faster product to market, faster adjustments in digital marketing, continuing to fuel our DTC business overtime and continuing with the strength of franchise style where the real upside to the brand long-term is. And I think this is the first time we've seen this kind of reaction to the UGG brand in spring and summer. And I truly believe that even without this situation, the UGG plus sandal franchise would have been an exciting product in this environment. And so those are the kinds of things that we're going to continue doing. I would say, bigger and more powerful, closely related to the brand DNA launches, leveraging our partners to reach consumers with new products and really filling DTC from a long range plan perspective.\nJim Duffy: Can I ask you to elaborate some on the merchandising strategies for this fiscal year with the UGG brand? Can you talk more about balancing newness with concentrating the merchandising assortment and known high velocity styles?\nDave Powers: So there's two keys to that. One is, we wanted to reduce the inventory in styles that were seasonally light with seasonal liability. So styles that were in and out one time styles that really in the scheme of things weren't generating a lot of volume. So the teams went back in the first week of the shutdown that in March, this is across all of our brands. We went through and adjusted buy really reduced SKU count anywhere from 20% to 30% going into the back half of the year to protect our level of margin liability and inventory in the channel. But more importantly really focusing on the big drivers of the business. And so I think you're going to see continued newness and things like our Fluff franchise. We have another launch coming out in June, the pride launch that just hit. There\u2019s another launch from that product in September and we have a lot of these planned. But what we've realized is the combination of UGG DNA and comfort and fashion is our formula to success. And we want to continue that with fewer styles but bigger volume, bigger impacts on us going forward. And then we also have our apparel launch this year that we talked about we're doing a pretty aggressive launch that was originally planned, it was something to do with DTC and some of the key wholesale stores with Nordstrom. So we\u2019re staying close but we're just getting more focused and disciplined and focus on speed along the way.\nOperator: Next question comes from Camilo Lyon with BTIG.\nCamilo Lyon: So a couple questions. So you talked about your backlog through mid maybe flattish. And you also said that you are contemplating or expecting more cancellations to happen but you haven't seen those yet to a large degree. So couple of questions on that. Can you tell us at what point in the year will you stop accepting cancellations? We're getting other than that window where we're a couple months away from shipments of fall starting to unfold. And it seems -- and it\u2019s early days, but it does seem that as stores start to reopen, the trends are less bad than initially feared, generally speaking. So I'm just curious to know how you're thinking about that?\nDave Powers: It's a good question. I think if that goes through kind of our scenario planning. So at this stage as wholesale accounts are still opening up, we want to see outdoors open up in terms of what the demand is, it goes back a little bit to the first question where we're seeing, I think initially and it's still early on and it\u2019s kind of the high proportion of e-commerce sales in the first part of this quarter, then it shifts to wholesale. But with the strength of e-commerce, it\u2019s giving us confidence in product sell through and wholesale accounts that are selling online or having strong sell through. So at this stage, we think it's still a little early to kind of call it in terms of when we call the line in terms of cancellations. We are working with accounts to understand where their product is, what the product is selling through. We have wholesale accounts. We have both online and physical presence. They're trying to use what they're learning from their online sales to help formulate an opinion kind of on physical store. So it's still ongoing. I think we've learned more in the last couple of weeks. We continue to see strong sell through. And I think it's giving some of our wholesalers confidence in how UGG is performing. So, again -- not providing guidance. But as we were thinking about the year and being cautious about what potentially could happen, recognizing we're still in the smallest part of our year, so first quarter representing less than 12% of our business, is just being a little bit cautious. We do have inventories. So we can fulfill orders but we want to be a little bit cautious in terms of what we're ordering. And we'll use what we're seeing to kind of educate us on how to think about kind of backlog from cancellations. But at this point, we just felt that it's prudent to be a little bit cautious and we expect that we'll see some more cancellations. But as we indicated in the change in the backlog, we have some cancellations. And we probably think it's a good part of the cancellations and then we'll see what happens as stores reopen.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, and we just initiated our last buy for the holiday season over the last week or so, had a lot of conversations with the wholesale team validating assumption from some of our wholesale partners. And where we decided to land is we're going to buy for reorders and in the past, we would buy a little bit more cushion on the upside. We have some good core inventory we're carrying over. We\u2019ll buy to the orders but we are expecting to see some cancellations as things progress. But the order book is also shifting between partners as people with more online presence are doing better than people with more store relevant, physical store reliance business. But it sits within the mix and then as the order book as we said still looks good and we\u2019re buying for that order book, and then we put ourselves in the chase position things are better than planned.\nCamilo Lyon: And then my follow-up is, if you take -- so you've given great color on the wholesale order book and how you're planning and how you'll build to orders inventory. Are you taking a comparable approach to the DTC business? It's now almost 40% of the business. So, are you taking a little bit more of a proactive approach in allocating more or better inventory to your DTC channel?\nDave Powers: We made some shifts obviously between what the expectations were have been for stores and e-commerce. So no surprise we're seeing a better business in e-commerce right now, obviously, because the stores are closed. We think that trend will continue. One of the big benefits of having a good e-commerce business right now is we're acquiring a lot of new consumers, and a lot of new young consumers in both HOKA and UGG that we can go back to in the holiday time frame. So we're optimistic that we're going to continue to have a strong online presence and online business. Shipping inventory but we can share easily between online and retail and then we are planning for more potential closeouts, if there are cancellations that we can funnel through those DTC channels as well with higher margin. So little bit more conservative there, but we do think in key styles of franchises that there is upside to e-commerce and we put that into our expectations.\nCamilo Lyon: So is it safe to say that your DTC plan is a little bit less conservative than what your wholesale plan is?\nDave Powers: Yes, I think that's fair.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna.\nSam Poser: I guess just to follow up. On the wholesale side of things, especially with HOKA on your partner's direct-to-consumer business -- on your partner's e-commerce businesses. Are you utilizing a good deal of drop ship right now? So you're basically reacting directly to the customers demands through their Web site, so you're doing a bit of that at the moment?\nSteve Fasching: We're doing small portion because a lot of those are smaller independent, so we're doing some of that but it's not a big part of our overall business at this time. We\u2019re available and we\u2019re offering it for sure.\nSam Poser: And then in the near-term, Steve, are you seeing sort of -- because of the way the business is going and such a shift to e-commerce and so on? Are there any structural gross margin headwinds in the near-term? Just because of the state of the market, not necessarily because you have -- it would be more on the fixed costs kind of situation rather than merch margin?\nSteve Fasching: What I would say on the near-term is and again, what we've seen in kind of the quarter to date is with a higher proportion of e-commerce, gross margins are contributing to an improvement in margins on the higher gross margins associated with that. Some of that will shift this as the bulk of remaining quarters shift to kind of wholesale. And then I think we'll have to see as we emerge from this kind of economic pressure. But in terms of kind of some margins as a higher proportion of our business in the first few weeks of the quarter have been more heavily on e-commerce, we're seeing some margin improvement there. We'll see a little bit of a shift as we see more wholesale being fulfilled in the back half of the first quarter. And then again, not provided guidance. But as we look at the balance for the year, we'll see how things develop in terms of promotions. And then in terms of how we're thinking about the organization as we talked about, it is shifting some resources to e-commerce to help drive the increased traffic that we're seeing there. So where we're finding efficiencies in the organization and I think some of that in our e-commerce infrastructure to facilitate the increased traffic and demand that we're seeing.\nDave Powers: And right now, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing full price selling very healthy rate for our brands and we want to maintain that through as long as we can. We are predicting there will be more suitable promotional environment in the back half of the year. But right now, full price sell through is strong. We opened the closet for UGG today on the Memorial Day weekend time frame to liquidate some of the spring product that we want to go to out, so we go into the back half the year clean. And so you might see a little bit of that in the marketplace but those are seasonal styles that aren't really important to the core business and we'll manage through that with what we have. But as Steve said, e-commerce has the strength right now a little bit more higher margins to date, but we have a lot of wholesale in order to do in the back half.\nSteve Fasching: And then the other thing that we've talked about like which was demonstrated last year is using marketing. So, we\u2019ve increased our marketing spend around that and we'll continue to use that as a lever as we evaluate kind of how sales continue to come in.\nSam Poser: And then just two more things, you alluded to sort of new channels of distribution. And I've been hearing that some of the sort of more athletic reach, you're starting to maybe build up assortments with some of the more athletic retailers that happened to generally have a decent digital platform as well. Can you give us some color on what's going on there? And then one of your major accounts earlier in the season decided to get promotional for a little bit of time. How are you reacting if people -- if your wholesale partners do something that hurt the brand?\nSteve Fasching: And as we've been seeing for a while how the sanctity of our brand and positioning in the market is first and foremost for us. So, we've been firm on pricing and we've had conversations with some of our partners. I think you saw some of that early in the quarter and that\u2019s the way we're going to approach this. This is, we see this as a shorter term headwind for the economy and our brands. But we're in this for the long haul and we want our brands to weather through this in a quality way. We're not going to chase revenue just chasing revenue and discounting brands to get there and that's the approach. For HOKA, generally speaking, we said the distribution and is the right distribution today, I think our access points to the consumer give us a good footprint, as well as driving business or e-commerce business. We did open Dick\u2019s recently for the first time, we did a test with them like three or four years ago. They were in and out quickly and that was before people really understood what hope was all about but the test so far has been going very well. We're very pleased with that. And we're going to continue to do business with Dick\u2019s with HOKA. Really primarily seeing online and probably 10 stores and expanding the assortment a little bit right now approching Bondi, we are going to be expanding into Rincon as well. But very pleased to see the reaction from the consumer, which tells us that awareness is growing dramatically for the HOKA brand. And in an environment like that, we're competing head-to-head with some of the best brands out there and to see the response is very encouraging for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo.\nTom Nikic: First, I want to ask about the European resets. The list, the pandemic and what\u2019s going on the last couple of months. So does that change anything as far as the European reset goes? Does it accelerate it, slow it down? Any color you can give on that would be helpful?\nDave Powers: As you know, we've talked about this on our last earnings call. We're going into this year with a focus on resetting UGG in the European marketplace, there's been some brand heat issues, inventory and the channel cleanup that we need to do. So the plan is still to do that We are looking at allocating resources this year from a marketing perspective where we want to focus. We made some adjustments between the EMEA business and the China business to show most of those up but really staying on course. And like I just said, we've instructed the teams over there not to chase revenue. They\u2019ll try not to discount the product, still focus on cleaning it up. It will be a challenge this year, obviously, they're getting pretty heavily affected across the region. And we're going to manage that tightly, but still reset is the goal and reigniting the brand and the classic franchise in the European consumer. Some good news though is we are seeing more adoption of the Fluff franchise and the slippers in that marketplace as we haven't seen in the past. And a lot of the PR and social and celebrity posts that we're getting for UGG right now, which has just phenomenal is starting to resonate nicely with the younger consumer over in that marketplace as well. So hopefully that will help with brand heat positioning. But from an inventory and marketplace perspective, we\u2019re going to manage it tightly with a goal of creating more of a scarcity model and resetting brand through the year.\nTom Nikic: And then just a follow up on HOKA. Right now, the wholesale distribution there\u2019s a lot of independent smaller retailers. Is there any concern about some of those retailers maybe not surviving the current lockdown, and what that would potentially do for the gross trajectory of HOKA?\nDave Powers: It's interesting, we had a call with the HOKA sales team and some of the marketing folks yesterday. And they're using some of the new analytical capabilities that we've created in the company to really take an assessment of each individual account based on their geographic location or where their states are within the closings or [Technical Difficulty]. But I think overall, it won't be significant to the trajectory that the HOKA brand is on. We still continue to fuel that with a big players and our online business, and their potential growth with Dick\u2019s and maybe offset some of that. So still optimistic. It all depends when they're able to reopen and the velocity of sales don\u2019t get at that time.\nSteve Fasching: And Tom, just to add to that. In my prepared remarks, I made the comment about kind a HOKA we're planning a little bit slower growth this year. So clearly, we will see some disruption as a result of COVID-19. But it's a short-term kind of disruption to the brand. So as Dave said, we're going to manage closely. We're going to work with the accounts. We\u2019re going to try to help accounts, where we can. And some won't make it that business will transfer to some somewhere else hopefully online.\nDave Powers: I think the demand is there certainly and I think this is not going to have an impact on the trajectory over the business overall. Just to further update, we are doing a little few more drops ships with our HOKA brand at this time to get an update from David, our COO. So that is happening which is we\u2019re happy to deal with the situation.\nOperator: Last question today will come from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. \nPaul Lejuez: But did you give an e-comm growth rate for quarter-to-date by brand? For second, just curious what percent of your SKUs sold to a wholesale partner ultimately sells through a store versus online? And then last, just curious what you've seen in China? I think you said those stores are all open. I'm curious how business has come back?\nSteve Fasching: I think the first part of the question was, what is we mentioned on kind of brand growth quarter-to-date. So what we\u2019ve said with was UGG was down, we didn't put -- we don't break out e-comm, but UGG is down, which is all channels down mid single-digit. HOKA up low 30% range, Teva down low 40%, Sanuk down mid 30%, but we don't necessarily break down out by channel. And DTC is, which is sales, is up 40%. stores and e-commerce combined and e-com is up triple digit\nDave Powers: And then you talked about SKU, what percent of SKUs is sold in wholesale, online versus store, did I get that right? \nPaul Lejuez: You're selling -- you've got big wholesale business. Curious if you have a sense of what percent of those units that you sell through one of your partners ultimately get sold through a store versus online? \nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think generally speaking, probably in the 30%, 40% range in a normal environment, certainly in this environment, assuming 95% to 100% with store closures in our wholesale partners.\nPaul Lejuez: And then just China experience?\nDave Powers: China, they've been through this. And we're learning a lot from our China team and the management over there. They were shut down obviously early in the year for about three months stores working from home, obviously a lot more serious and the shutdown is being here. They are back to work in the offices, not fully back there's still some work from home situations happening there, which is fine. They\u2019re managing the business right. They're working closely with our wholesale partners who are also having some serious headwind, because they don't have e-commerce with the stores. And then the stores that were opening, they\u2019re back online, they're not to the level that they were. We\u2019d expect them to be to keep in mind retail stores for UGG at this time of year in China is very low volume, but the e-commerce business has pick-up nicely in the marketplace. So there will still be some headwinds through the year, but I think we do some cleanup and help our partners through some of their inventory challenges. But all in all we're seeing good reaction to the products that\u2019s in the marketplace now, both in the slippers category but also some of our sneaker, such as the LA class style that just launched. And then continuing to manage tightly the HOKA business in that marketplace as well. So back on track, back up and operating but the consumers\u2019 responds to opened stores is still slowly coming back and I think it's going to be that way for a little while.\nPaul Lejuez: Can I just go back to the 30% to 40% that you mentioned selling online through your wholesale partners? Does that defer much by brand?\nSteve Fasching: It will be, HOKA will have a higher percentage of what they're selling online in terms of the line of products\u2026\nDave Powers: Across the board, that will be independent or not. Those will be heavily weighted more on store versus e-commerce, the small independents. So generally speaking, I think it all depends on the account, department stores, anywhere from 30% to 40%, some cases maybe a little bit higher. And then the smaller independents is less online business. So, it averages out I would say across all brands, from 30% to 40%. The other thing just real quick is I don't know how the industry has really thought about this, but it is something that we're thinking about with the lack of Chinese tourists travel, presumably through the rest of the year and beyond that's going to have impact on global outlet businesses, European businesses, but it\u2019s been a positive impact to the China business. So we don\u2019t know what that looks like, it's something that we're monitoring closely. But I think it is going to be a factor in the industry that we're going to have to pay attention to.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and also concludes our conference.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone. As our fiscal year 2020 came to an end, communities around the world were experiencing impacts from the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of the Deckers organization, I'd like to extend our thoughts to everyone affected by the virus and share our deepest gratitude to all the individuals on the frontlines of this crisis, especially the healthcare workers and first responders. I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their efforts during this unprecedented time. The entire Deckers organization understands that this is a very difficult time for many people. I'm proud of how our employees and brands have risen to the occasion to serve communities in need through programs such as our better together initiative that we launched to support COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. Through monetary contributions, we're working to support small businesses in our communities and the individuals they employ. In addition, our brands are contributing in kind donations of product. To-date we've donated over 10,000 pairs of shoes to first responders and essential workers. At Deckers, we believe doing good is essential to the success of our employees, brands and organization as a whole. We'll continue to do our part and supporting those in need through these trying times. We're all in this together. Given the extraordinary circumstances, today's dialog is going to follow different structure than our past earnings calls. To outline, I'll begin with a discussion on how we're responding to and navigating through the crisis. Then give an update on the status of our operations, as well as walk through some of the trends we're seeing in the business through the first half of our first quarter. And finish with a condensed overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 performance, which will include some details on the pandemic's effects in our business in the fourth quarter. Steve will then review the numbers in more detail and expand on some of our COVID-19 related action items. After that, we'll be happy to take questions. From a business perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have widespread effects across our entire industry. However, I believe Deckers is well positioned to weather these impacts with the foundation of the organization we have created over the past three years. We have built a resilient portfolio of healthy brands, delivered levels of operating profit that are top tier among our peer group and most importantly, we maintained a robust liquidity position of over $1 billion between our cash balance and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As we plan for fiscal year 2021 and beyond, our leadership team is focused on protecting the progress we made in our brands, as well as our position as a best-in-class organization. We've developed numerous scenarios in evaluating the pandemic's potential impact on our business with an eye on the timing of when the consumer re-emerges into what we would call the new normal. Our scenario planning has produced action plans intended to mitigate related headwinds, while at the same time, comparing us to the future state of business, representing our brands to deliver a compelling experience and what we anticipate will be a much different consumer landscape and selling environment. With that in mind, we've taken the following actions to empower the Deckers organization to emerge stronger exiting the pandemic, including protecting our brands; maintaining the effectiveness of our organization and preserving our strong liquidity position; reallocating marketing spend to prioritize digital growth, while supporting strategic areas of brand level investment; and adjusting inventory buys to reflect more conservative scenarios of consumer demand with a focus on skew productivity and high velocity product turns; and learning from new ways of working, including working remotely and leveraging technology. In addition to these actions, we are holding frequent discussions with our wholesale partners as we work in tandem to support the health of our brands. We continue to monitor updates from health officials, expert agencies and local authorities to inform our decision making process. Steve will provide more details later in the call on how these actions inform our fiscal 2021 planning. From an operations perspective, our Marina Valley Distribution Center has continued to operate since reopening. This DC is operating at a modified and slightly limited capacity due to increased social distancing measures taken as a precaution to maintain employee safety. The safety of our employees is our top consideration as we make adjustments to our operations. As a result, we may experience some challenges as we approach peak months of shipping late in our second quarter and early in the third quarter. These are all factors relevant to our scenario planning. We are also making adjustments to the operations of our retail store fleet to appropriately accommodate updated health and safety measures in order to protect our retail store employees, as well as our customers visiting our physical locations. We are intentionally reopening at a measured pace and using the early learnings to shape our broader go forward strategy. Our direct to consumer leadership is empowering retail associates with educational tools and training related to the new working environment. With the small number of doors that we have reopened, we are encouraged to see consumers actively reengaging with the UGG brand stores. In terms of stores opened versus closed as of this week by region; about 20% of North America stores are open and operating in a very limited capacity; roughly half of our EMEA stores are open; approximately 20% of our stores in Japan are open; and all of our owned retail stores in China are open. Though, a portion of our stores have opened across the globe. most of them are closed for the majority of the 45-day period I'll be outlining momentarily. We'll continue to adjust store openings, as well as our warehouse operations based on the guidance provided by health officials, expert agencies, as well as federal, state and local officials. From a sourcing standpoint, we have a network of financially strong and well managed strategic partners, from material vendors to factories. With the help of our sourcing and material teams, we have worked closely with our strategic partners to ramp up quickly after the COVID-19 related closures. At this point, we do not have any major concerns from a sourcing perspective. From an employee standpoint, across North America, Europe and Japan, our corporate teams have temporarily transitioned to a work from home environment where possible by defined rules. I'm pleased with how our employees have stepped up and proven to be highly productive in this new and dynamic environment. We'll look to health officials, expert agencies and local authorities, to identify both the timing of when to return to offices and what adjustments will be necessary to provide a safe space, including the appropriate social distancing measures. I'll now walk through our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance to-date as compared to last year, which includes April 1st through May 15th. While these trends relates to what we are currently experiencing, due to historical seasonality of our business, this time period only represents roughly 5% of our annual sales volume. And thus, is not necessarily indicative of the dynamics that we anticipate for future periods. On that note, as we move later into the first quarter, our business becomes more wholesale weighted and marketplace dynamics for the upcoming months remain fluid. Overall, the business is trending down single digits quarter to date as compared to last year, with wholesale trending down in the mid-30% range and direct to consumer trending up in the high 40% range. Wholesale trends are being driven by store closures as many wholesalers are not taking new shipments of product while stores remain closed. We've remained in close contact with our wholesale partners as we work together to support our brands. Our brands are experiencing different impacts from the current wholesale environment. And this is the low period of volume for UGG and Koolaburra, while our HOKA ONE ONE brand is spread more evenly throughout the year. For Hoka, we've made adjustments to our product launches and inventory purchasing, to better allow our wholesale partners to capture consumer demand with existing inventory as they're able to reopen stores and work to best leverage our online presence. For our direct-to-consumer business, as I mentioned, the majority of our 145 stores remain closed but we're seeing triple digit e-commerce growth, driven by full price selling at both UGG and HOKA, helping to offset some of the volume loss from retail. I would note that the first quarter is traditionally a lowest period of direct-to-consumer volume, and the mix of HOKA e-commerce is disproportionately larger than in total DC volume than in other quarters. We've been very encouraged by the consistently strong interest in our UGG and HOKA brands, as evidenced by Google Trends over the last two months. With UGG search interest up 73% over the last year and HOKA search interest growth being second highest among peer brands. We think this speaks well to the power of our brands, that consumers are actively searching and buying our products during a historically low period of consumer demand. We're also experiencing a substantial gain in new customer acquisition online, which has been great news as we know that customers entering our online database have a higher lifetime value and purchase frequency than those purchasing in stores. We're especially excited about UGG customer acquisitions as this is typically a lower volume period for the brand. And our strategy aims to convert these new customers into repeat purchases down the road in the holiday period. I would like to caution though, as we move into the second and third quarters, retail volume typically becomes more impactful to our overall results. And we do not expect e-commerce to fully capture lost retail sales volume in the event that stores remain closed or limited in operation. From a global brand perspective, our quarter-to-date performance by brand across all channels, compared to last year through May 15th include, UGG down mid-single-digits due to lower wholesale shipments, resulting from doors remaining shut, as well as the impact of our owned retail store closures. However, we are very encouraged to see the pent up demand being captured through our e-commerce channel. HOKA up in the low 30% range, and now 45 days in the small portion of the full year, we are going to continue filling the brand with a goal of sustaining growth above fiscal 2020. And Teva and Sanuk down in the low 40% and mid 30% ranges respectively, as these brands are experiencing a heavier impact due to the seasonality of their businesses, with Koolaburra representing an immaterial volume during this period of year. While we feel positive about the trends we're seeing in the business, there's still plenty of hurdles to overcome in a challenged consumer environment with social distancing practices in place and recessionary concerns that could pressure discretionary spending. Moving into our discussion on fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 performance. Revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was down 5% versus last year to $375 million with the shortfall driven by an approximate $25 million headwind from unforeseen COVID-19 impacts. As a reminder, we provided fourth quarter guidance on January 30th. And at that time, we had only anticipated preliminary estimates of COVID-19 impacts on our China business. To provide a little more color on how our performance was impacted by this event in the fourth quarter, our prior guidance anticipated China headwinds of approximately $5 million for the quarter compared to last year, mostly driven by store closures and our performance aligned with this expectation. As the pandemic spread to Europe, we saw significant deterioration of the quarter-to-date growth rate trend in the region, shifting from over 20% over last year at the end of February to just 6% over last year at the end of March. As the United States shutdown in mid-March, we have been trending around 3% over last year through March 15th and saw this decline to 8% below last year by the end of March, with combined impact of retail store closures, as well as reduced wholesale shipments. Despite the fourth quarter impacts, full year fiscal 2020 performance remained strong as revenue grew by 6% versus the prior year to $2.133 billion and earnings per share increased 9% versus the prior year to $9.62. Deckers' fiscal year 2020 performance is a result of having great brands that have built lasting relationships with consumers and continue to build awareness and momentum through targeted focused investments, complemented by a disciplined approach to managing expenses. Turning to the brand highlights during fiscal year 2020, starting with the fashion and lifestyle group, which is comprised of our UGG and Koolaburra brand. For full year fiscal 2020, global UGG sales declined by 1% versus last year to $1.521 billion. Considering lost revenue on Q4 due to COVID-19, UGG would have been roughly flat last year, which is inclusive of a large headwind related to the European marketplace reset in progress. In contrast to the headwinds of the brands and international businesses, UGG grew by 5% in the United States for the second consecutive year. The UGG brand strength in the U.S. has been driven by; high levels of brand heat through PR and targeted marketing investments; driving brand search interest up 8% as compared to last year; winning with younger consumers as DTC purchasers aged 18 to 34 increased by 29% versus last year; increased loyalty membership and purchasing as enrollment in UGG rewards increased 60% and revenue from members grew 19% as compared to last year. with members spending more on average; and a diversified product mix as the Fluff Yeah and Neumel franchises, both drove significant growth. We'll look to build on the strength of our domestic business, as we whether the evolving economic and retail landscape in fiscal 2021, and look to capitalize on the brand strength as work from home becomes a new normal for many of our consumers. The UGG team has made compelling progress in the brand's domestic business over the past three years, and is focused on protecting the brand sanctity that they worked so hard to build. Moving to Koolaburra, global revenue in fiscal year 2020 grew by 58% versus last year to $70 million. The Koolaburra brand's performance was fueled by another year of strong full price sell through and market share gains within the domestics family value channel. Koolaburra also experienced success with its licensed home business, and has plans to expand to licensed lounge wear this fall in an effort to further extend the brand's lifestyle appeal. Given the value proposition of the brand, we believe Koolaburra will be poised to capture demand from budget conscious consumers in the coming year. Moving to the performance lifestyle group, which comprised of the HOKA, Teva and Sanuk brands. Starting with HOKA, global revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by 58% versus last year to $353 million. The HOKA brand far outperformed our expectations from the outset of this year. HOKA growth has been consistently balanced across the globe in the brands domestic and international businesses, and across both wholesale and direct to consumer channels. This balance has been achieved due to the team's dedication to what we refer to as the HOKA ecosystem, which provides a universally elevated consumer experience across all regions and channels of distribution. Leveraging the organizational expertise that exists in a multi-brand portfolio, the HOKA brand has quickly evolved its digital presence to become a core strength and represent the ultimate access point of the brand. HOKA digital has become a serious driver of both customer retention and new customer acquisition. Both retained and acquiring customers nearly doubled year-over-year in the HOKA brand's global direct to consumer business. The HOKA brand success in fiscal year 2020 is a result of great heritage products, new product innovation and continuing refinements of the HOKA ecosystem attracting new consumers. HOKA has significant momentum. And while broader market trends may limit the brand's incredible growth rate in fiscal year 2021, we're going to continue investing in HOKA to fuel our brand and consumer informed marketplace strategy. Turning to our Teva and Sanuk brand. Global revenue in fiscal year 2020 was $138 million and $51 million respectively. Both the Teva and Sanuk brands are attracting consumers with innovative product introductions that feature sustainability stories. This includes Teva's Strap in to Freedom campaign, highlighting new use of recycled materials now on nearly all the original sandal straps. Similarly, Sanuk continues to operate eco-friendly options, including their [Bead-in] collection. To amplify these efforts and embrace the ever changing serve specialty space, the Sanuk brand has recently streamlined operations to work directly with our internal innovation department, known as Deckers labs. By collaborating directly with Deckers labs, recreating cost efficiencies in the business, while also reinvigorating the Sanuk brand innovation engine. With respect to channel performance, global wholesale sales increased 7% for the full fiscal year. Fiscal 2020 performance was driven primarily by domestic strength in the HOKA, UGG and Koolaburra brands. Domestic wholesale has now grown over 9% for two consecutive years based on the strength of these brands. For the year, international wholesale increased low single-digits due to HOKA brand's expansion, being partially offset by the ongoing European reset of the UGG brand that is similar to the strategy we successfully implemented in the UGG brand's domestic wholesale marketplace. We also experienced negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. Global direct-to-consumer sales increased 3% for the full fiscal year, comparable sales for full fiscal year increased 5% versus the prior year. Please note that our GDV comp for fiscal 2020 has been adjusted to exclude the final weeks of March retail volume as a result of COVID-19. For the full year, DTC performance was driven by global growth of the HOKA brand, as the brand nearly doubled its e-commerce volume year-over-year and domestic strength of the UGG brand online. We've been intensely focused on enhancing the adoption of our brands online over the past few years, and this will be a primary focus in fiscal 2021 with the disruption of the retail landscape. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results, as well as some additional thoughts on fiscal 2021. Thank you, Steve. As I reflect on the year's performance, my key takeaway is recognizing the strength of our brand, along with an appreciation for their commitment to staying purpose driven. The power of each brand lies within the authentic connections they forge with their respective consumer base. Each of our brands remains open for business and are here to serve consumers during this uncertain time. Special thanks to our employees in the frontline, including our warehouse teams, retail associates and customer service agents, who continue to deliver and serve our customers in these extraordinary circumstances. As we look towards adapting operations to endure the near-term challenges, we're doing so with our sights on the future. We are evaluating our business strategically and intend to emerge from this pandemic with new opportunities and additional strength in the Deckers portfolio. As we navigate forward, I am confident that the Deckers organization will embrace challenges, adopting new ways to collaborate, thrive and inspire each other, as we build in our foundation to become stronger. Through it all, we will develop ways to improve our business, including innovations within our planning, production and the delivery of compelling product to the market. As we evolve these operations, we'll be mindful to preserve the progress we've made and we'll stay true to their underlying strategy. The Deckers organization will overcome near-term hurdles, while setting our sights on the goal of emerging stronger. With that in mind, we will continue to fuel the HOKA brand with digital marketing campaigns and virtual touchpoints to engage with consumers; focus on what matters in UGG, leaning into key styles and protecting marketplace management progress; enhance our e-commerce capabilities and digital presence in the omni-channel atmosphere, as we look to accelerate even faster during and beyond this crisis; and stay true to the Deckers spirit becoming better together as we evolve and innovate in the face of challenge, looking to continually develop and improve our operations and community. Overall, in the current environment, our company, brand and balance sheet are well positioned. We will manage the business with a high level of flexibility throughout the rest of the year. Thank you to all of our stakeholders. On behalf of the entire organization, I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these times. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? First of all, I also want to say, hope everybody on the call is safe and healthy with their families, and appreciate everybody listening in. We are and we have since over the last few years built very, very strong relationships with our key wholesale partners. And I will say the teams on a weekly if not daily basis are having conversations with these partners to navigate through this what's happening in the business now. As you heard on the call, the script, the wholesale business right now is actually performing very well from a sell through perspective, and the order book is holding pretty well for the back half of the year. And what we're hearing from our wholesale partners from an UGG perspective is they're still confident that UGG is going to be a key brand for them in the back half of the year. We've heard that they need to be successful in the holiday timeframe as we all know. And the current trend is happening with Fluff Yeah program, Flipper and Neumel things are progressing well. So certainly there's challenges with store opening, but we are seeing in our business and also some of our key partners, very strong uptick in e-commerce, which is making up some of that loss in stores. And I think with stores opening hopefully here and key partners over the coming months, we'll see some improvements there. So the outlook right now seems very, very good confident about it. We're hearing from our partners that UGG is going to be a key brand in their portfolio for the rest of the year. They are making cuts and so we are just being mindful of that and monitoring it. But so far the first five or six weeks into the quarter, I think they're [indiscernible] nicely for UGG and then same with HOKA. I think what we're finding is both HOKA and UGG are proving to be really important brand for consumers right now. UGG on the work from home comfort, lifestyle perspective, it's nice to know that when people think of comfort and home and casual, they do think of UGG first and foremost. And then a lot of consumers, as you all know, are doing home workouts and trying to exercise more. And so that trend is also continuing to keep HOKA as a critical brand. And I think you've seen that in the Google Trends data that came out that we referenced in the script. The brands are demand. We're challenged with wholesale store openings at our own store openings. But we think the outlook where we stand today looks good. Yes, and I think it's key to understand this is a smaller portion of our total year. And so while the trends right now look good, especially in the context of the situation we're all in, it's promising we have a long way to go. We don't know yet of reward we were going to get as wholesale is continuing to manage tightly over there. Yes, I think it's a couple of things that are happening for HOKA. One of the things we wanted to do, first and foremost, we want to protect the positioning and the strength and the distribution that Erinn has built over the last three or four years. That is first and foremost. We see HOKA being around for a long time, being very important brand in the industry for a long time. And we're taking a long range approach to this. So what the team did is pushed out some of the launches of products where that has allowed for our partners and our sales to sell through inventory products that's already in the pipeline at full price. If you've been paying attention to the HOKA brand that are on the marketplace you will see there's little to no discounting on the brand, that's because we managed inventory tightly. There's no reason to just kind of because it's selling through well the margins are high and our partners are benefiting from that high average retail and margin. And then staggering some of the lunches throughout the year to be in line with where the demand is and the inventory level. The whole ecosystem, which is what we like to call, the combination of strategic partners in our online business is performing very well. And we're driving more business to our e-commerce site which is great because we're acquiring more consumers and that's driving up margins a little bit in short-term right now as well. So still optimistic, we know this is going to be a headwind for the brands. But right now full price selling is strong. We still see this as a growth brand, even though this year will be challenging and getting back to high level of growth coming from '22 and beyond. So the goal is protect the brands, maintain tight distribution, maintain full price selling, more of a pull model from consumers and continue to do that with powerful launches. And we have some great innovative launches coming through in the next eight to 10 months. Yes, you know we had a lot of conversations just around that what is the new normal. I think they're just trying to figure that out. And for us, there's a couple things. From a employee standpoint, we are seeing some positive results from the work from home scenario or situation, both in the ability to stay connected and make decisions faster, which I think is great and then beneficial to the team and also allows us to be more efficient in our spend and reduce travel. So there has been from an operation and employee workforce perspective that we will probably continue in the long-term, leveraging technology to reduce travel, using 3D and imaging for our failed samples and reducing cost there. There's a lot of good benefits. The things that we knew and we're working on but we've had the opportunity right now through technology to accelerate some of those things. From a business standpoint, like we've been saying for the last two years now, we see a handful of really strong strategic wholesale partners, leveraging them to access to consumer and across the different demographics of our consumer base and that's emerging, and then really continuing to fill our DTC business. And so we've shifted pretty dramatically the marketing efforts to be much more in tuned with what's happening in the consumer now. We're using a lot more user generated content, leveraging in TR and we're getting fantastic response to that. So I think you're going to see a shift to faster product to market, faster adjustments in digital marketing, continuing to fuel our DTC business overtime and continuing with the strength of franchise style where the real upside to the brand long-term is. And I think this is the first time we've seen this kind of reaction to the UGG brand in spring and summer. And I truly believe that even without this situation, the UGG plus sandal franchise would have been an exciting product in this environment. And so those are the kinds of things that we're going to continue doing. I would say, bigger and more powerful, closely related to the brand DNA launches, leveraging our partners to reach consumers with new products and really filling DTC from a long range plan perspective. So there's two keys to that. One is, we wanted to reduce the inventory in styles that were seasonally light with seasonal liability. So styles that were in and out one time styles that really in the scheme of things weren't generating a lot of volume. So the teams went back in the first week of the shutdown that in March, this is across all of our brands. We went through and adjusted buy really reduced SKU count anywhere from 20% to 30% going into the back half of the year to protect our level of margin liability and inventory in the channel. But more importantly really focusing on the big drivers of the business. And so I think you're going to see continued newness and things like our Fluff franchise. We have another launch coming out in June, the pride launch that just hit. There's another launch from that product in September and we have a lot of these planned. But what we've realized is the combination of UGG DNA and comfort and fashion is our formula to success. And we want to continue that with fewer styles but bigger volume, bigger impacts on us going forward. And then we also have our apparel launch this year that we talked about we're doing a pretty aggressive launch that was originally planned, it was something to do with DTC and some of the key wholesale stores with Nordstrom. So we're staying close but we're just getting more focused and disciplined and focus on speed along the way. It's a good question. I think if that goes through kind of our scenario planning. So at this stage as wholesale accounts are still opening up, we want to see outdoors open up in terms of what the demand is, it goes back a little bit to the first question where we're seeing, I think initially and it's still early on and it's kind of the high proportion of e-commerce sales in the first part of this quarter, then it shifts to wholesale. But with the strength of e-commerce, it's giving us confidence in product sell through and wholesale accounts that are selling online or having strong sell through. So at this stage, we think it's still a little early to kind of call it in terms of when we call the line in terms of cancellations. We are working with accounts to understand where their product is, what the product is selling through. We have wholesale accounts. We have both online and physical presence. They're trying to use what they're learning from their online sales to help formulate an opinion kind of on physical store. So it's still ongoing. I think we've learned more in the last couple of weeks. We continue to see strong sell through. And I think it's giving some of our wholesalers confidence in how UGG is performing. So, again -- not providing guidance. But as we were thinking about the year and being cautious about what potentially could happen, recognizing we're still in the smallest part of our year, so first quarter representing less than 12% of our business, is just being a little bit cautious. We do have inventories. So we can fulfill orders but we want to be a little bit cautious in terms of what we're ordering. And we'll use what we're seeing to kind of educate us on how to think about kind of backlog from cancellations. But at this point, we just felt that it's prudent to be a little bit cautious and we expect that we'll see some more cancellations. But as we indicated in the change in the backlog, we have some cancellations. And we probably think it's a good part of the cancellations and then we'll see what happens as stores reopen. We made some shifts obviously between what the expectations were have been for stores and e-commerce. So no surprise we're seeing a better business in e-commerce right now, obviously, because the stores are closed. We think that trend will continue. One of the big benefits of having a good e-commerce business right now is we're acquiring a lot of new consumers, and a lot of new young consumers in both HOKA and UGG that we can go back to in the holiday time frame. So we're optimistic that we're going to continue to have a strong online presence and online business. Shipping inventory but we can share easily between online and retail and then we are planning for more potential closeouts, if there are cancellations that we can funnel through those DTC channels as well with higher margin. So little bit more conservative there, but we do think in key styles of franchises that there is upside to e-commerce and we put that into our expectations. Yes, I think that's fair. And right now, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing full price selling very healthy rate for our brands and we want to maintain that through as long as we can. We are predicting there will be more suitable promotional environment in the back half of the year. But right now, full price sell through is strong. We opened the closet for UGG today on the Memorial Day weekend time frame to liquidate some of the spring product that we want to go to out, so we go into the back half the year clean. And so you might see a little bit of that in the marketplace but those are seasonal styles that aren't really important to the core business and we'll manage through that with what we have. But as Steve said, e-commerce has the strength right now a little bit more higher margins to date, but we have a lot of wholesale in order to do in the back half. As you know, we've talked about this on our last earnings call. We're going into this year with a focus on resetting UGG in the European marketplace, there's been some brand heat issues, inventory and the channel cleanup that we need to do. So the plan is still to do that We are looking at allocating resources this year from a marketing perspective where we want to focus. We made some adjustments between the EMEA business and the China business to show most of those up but really staying on course. And like I just said, we've instructed the teams over there not to chase revenue. They'll try not to discount the product, still focus on cleaning it up. It will be a challenge this year, obviously, they're getting pretty heavily affected across the region. And we're going to manage that tightly, but still reset is the goal and reigniting the brand and the classic franchise in the European consumer. Some good news though is we are seeing more adoption of the Fluff franchise and the slippers in that marketplace as we haven't seen in the past. And a lot of the PR and social and celebrity posts that we're getting for UGG right now, which has just phenomenal is starting to resonate nicely with the younger consumer over in that marketplace as well. So hopefully that will help with brand heat positioning. But from an inventory and marketplace perspective, we're going to manage it tightly with a goal of creating more of a scarcity model and resetting brand through the year. It's interesting, we had a call with the HOKA sales team and some of the marketing folks yesterday. And they're using some of the new analytical capabilities that we've created in the company to really take an assessment of each individual account based on their geographic location or where their states are within the closings or [Technical Difficulty]. But I think overall, it won't be significant to the trajectory that the HOKA brand is on. We still continue to fuel that with a big players and our online business, and their potential growth with Dick's and maybe offset some of that. So still optimistic. It all depends when they're able to reopen and the velocity of sales don't get at that time. I think the demand is there certainly and I think this is not going to have an impact on the trajectory over the business overall. Just to further update, we are doing a little few more drops ships with our HOKA brand at this time to get an update from David, our COO. So that is happening which is we're happy to deal with the situation. And then you talked about SKU, what percent of SKUs is sold in wholesale, online versus store, did I get that right? China, they've been through this. And we're learning a lot from our China team and the management over there. They were shut down obviously early in the year for about three months stores working from home, obviously a lot more serious and the shutdown is being here. They are back to work in the offices, not fully back there's still some work from home situations happening there, which is fine. They're managing the business right. They're working closely with our wholesale partners who are also having some serious headwind, because they don't have e-commerce with the stores. And then the stores that were opening, they're back online, they're not to the level that they were. We'd expect them to be to keep in mind retail stores for UGG at this time of year in China is very low volume, but the e-commerce business has pick-up nicely in the marketplace. So there will still be some headwinds through the year, but I think we do some cleanup and help our partners through some of their inventory challenges. But all in all we're seeing good reaction to the products that's in the marketplace now, both in the slippers category but also some of our sneaker, such as the LA class style that just launched. And then continuing to manage tightly the HOKA business in that marketplace as well. So back on track, back up and operating but the consumers' responds to opened stores is still slowly coming back and I think it's going to be that way for a little while. Across the board, that will be independent or not. Those will be heavily weighted more on store versus e-commerce, the small independents. So generally speaking, I think it all depends on the account, department stores, anywhere from 30% to 40%, some cases maybe a little bit higher. And then the smaller independents is less online business. So, it averages out I would say across all brands, from 30% to 40%. The other thing just real quick is I don't know how the industry has really thought about this, but it is something that we're thinking about with the lack of Chinese tourists travel, presumably through the rest of the year and beyond that's going to have impact on global outlet businesses, European businesses, but it's been a positive impact to the China business. So we don't know what that looks like, it's something that we're monitoring closely. But I think it is going to be a factor in the industry that we're going to have to pay attention to."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Before we jump into our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results, as well as an overview of our approach to managing the business in this unprecedented environment, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strategies we've implemented over the past few years. The actions we've taken have built a more efficient business and created a strong framework and solid footing to navigate the current uncertainty. More specifically, we've implemented the UGG domestic wholesale marketplace management strategy; reducing the risk of excess inventory in the wholesale marketplace and lowering the risk of default with a smaller and healthier account base; built a strong partnership for the HOKA brand in the run specialty channel, driving awareness and customer affinity, while also capturing accelerated demand through direct-to-consumer; invested in digital infrastructure and marketing for all our brands to deliver a compelling consumer experience; shifted cost structure by reducing fixed costs and investing in variable categories; consolidated our factory base to work with financially strong partners with diversified operations outside of China; and made a targeted improvement to Teva and Sanuk profitability. The flexibility of our operating model is serving us well during these challenging times, allowing us to effectively navigate the current environment. We believe that our past and ongoing efforts provide the foundation to proactively manage through the COVID-19 disruption. We're working from a relative position of strength as compared to our peers due to the significant operating enhancements we've made over the past few years. Our actions drove improvements of over 600 basis points to our non-GAAP operating margin as compared to fiscal 2017, and more than doubled cash and equivalents to $649 million at the end of our year fiscal 2020. Now moving to our results. While we ended the year with revenue slightly below our January guidance, the main driver of the shortfall was the impact of the global pandemic in the final weeks of March. Despite these headwinds, Deckers still delivered a third consecutive full year of mid-single-digit revenue growth and top tier operating margins among peers. Our full year fiscal 2020 revenue came in at $2.133 billion, representing growth of 5.6% over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew by 6.5% as compared to last year. The HOKA brand contributed the majority of the year-over-year increase, up $129 million with Koolaburra contributing an incremental $26 million over last year with Sanuk and UGG revenue offsetting some of the gains. Absent fourth quarter impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe UGG revenue would have been roughly flat to last year. Additionally, with the results achieved, UGG brand revenue in the year was flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Overall, these results were below the high-end of our guidance range by $27 million, with fourth quarter revenue coming in at $375 million, down 4.9% from last year. The lower than expected revenue was predominantly driven by approximately $25 million headwind related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These headwinds were driven by approximately $20 million related to wholesale shipments as the final two weeks of March typically include high volume shipping of spring summer product, and we experienced disruption from both the temporary closure of our West Coast distribution center, as well as wholesale partners closing stores. And $5 million in loss direct-to-consumer sales as we closed the majority of our retail locations in mid-March. Gross margins for the full fiscal year was 51.8%, up 26 basis points to last year. The increase in gross margin was driven by margin expansion in our performance lifestyle group brands, lower UGG domestic wholesale promotional activity and less close out volume, partially offset by negative currency pressure from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, increased UGG brand promotional activity outside of the U.S. and channel mix headwinds due to wholesale dollar growth outpacing DTC. This result includes the strong performance of gross margins in the fourth quarter, which came in slightly above our implied guidance of 51.5% with outperformance largely driven by gains in our performance lifestyle group. From an expense standpoint, our full year spend was up 7.4% to $765.5 million compared to last year's GAAP spend of $712.9 million, and up 7.3% to last year's non-GAAP spend of $713.3 million. As a percentage of sales, expenses de-levered against the prior year, which was aligned with our guidance as we executed reinvestment plans behind our key initiatives, including investments in marketing to drive brand heat and awareness in HOKA, UGG men and UGG women's non-core styles, building our technology, tools and talent base to advance analytical capabilities and drive efficiencies in how we connect with consumers and using innovation to develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio. These results are inclusive of actions we were able to take during the fourth quarter in conjunction with the lower revenue we were experiencing. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we benefited from the reversal of accruals related to performance-based compensation, as well as a lower tax expense resulting from jurisdictional mix and timing of certain tax items. Our effective tax rate for the year was 19%, which was largely benefited from a state refund and other onetime discrete items, which compares favorably to 19.6% in the previous year. The impact of these results drove earnings per share of $0.57 in the fourth quarter, ultimately delivering a full year fiscal 2020 earnings per share of $9.62, which compares to last year's $8.84 and our guidance range of $9.40 to $9.50. The $0.78 increase to last year was driven by higher sales and profitability in the performance lifestyle group and the fashion lifestyle group's domestic business, and benefits of share repurchases, interest income and the lower tax rate, with offsets coming from lower sales of UGG internationally due to the ongoing marketplace reset in EMEA and higher spend related to investment behind building technology tools and the talent base to advance our analytical capabilities. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2020, we ended fiscal 2020 with $649 million in cash compared to $590 million cash last year, with additional availability of $469 million to borrow on existing lines of credit. Inventories were up 11.8% at $312 million compared to last year at $279 million. Note that inventory growth over last year would have been below the rate of sales growth if not for the revenue impacts experienced in the fourth quarter due to COVID-19. And in looking at our inventory position, we are comfortable with the quality of our inventory on hand as the high proportion represents core product with low levels of markdown risk. During the fiscal year, we repurchased $190 million worth of shares. But as we did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter, we still have $160 million remaining authorized for repurchase as of March 31, 2020. And with the current near term uncertainty and emphasis on liquidity and cash management, we've decided to pause any share repurchase activity for the time being. Although, we may commence share repurchase in future periods as we deem appropriate. And for the year, these results once again returned invested capital above 20%. Switching gears to our global backlog, which includes bulk orders and represents an order book snapshot as of March 31, 2020. Backlog was up 4.6% versus the prior year at March 31, 2019. Given the current state of the economy, we do not believe backlog represents a true indicator of performance, and we are not planning our business based on backlog. Subsequent to March 31st, we have experienced some cancellations related to COVID-19 disruption. As a result, our total backlog as of mid-May, inclusive of all brands, has declined to be roughly flat as compared to last year. While we haven't seen a large amount of cancellations to date, we anticipate there will be additional cancellations and thus, are taking a cautious approach in planning the back half of fiscal year 2021. Overall, we are forecasting cancellations to outweigh reorders, the backlog does not include any indication of direct-to-consumer expectations. And as mentioned earlier, the retail environment remains unclear. Finally moving on to our forward looking expectation for fiscal year 2021. Given the ongoing and fluid economic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not be providing specific guidance for full fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will outline the major themes and how we are managing the business in these uncertain times. While we are not providing guidance, we are approaching fiscal year 2021 with the expectation that total revenue will decline year-over-year, but we believe the HOKA brand will still experience some growth, albeit at a rate lower than we've seen in our first quarter to date trend. The fashion lifestyle group will face headwinds related to the continued international softness and wholesale cancellations. Inventory levels will be elevated as we carry core product from spring and summer season disruption, as well as delay product launches to protect the health of our brand. And expenses will be tightly managed as we look to conserve our cash balance. As Dave mentioned, we've already taken some actions to reduce expense in fiscal year 2021. But we've also developed a number of scenarios to adjust spending based on the timing of expected economic recovery and our operational performance along the way. We have had meaningful discussions with our key wholesale partners to help inform our partnership in planning inventory buys and peak season volume. We believe a conservative approach in fiscal year 2021 will set up a strong return to our operating model in year fiscal 2022. Prior to the spread of the pandemic, we have been planning a continuation of our operating model, which included increased investments in our key initiatives to drive further top-line growth. Now that we are operating in a much different climate, we've reduced planned expenses related to our priorities expectation of revenue growth, and plan to redeploy a portion of our existing expense base to areas with the highest return. More specifically, some of the adjustments that we've made, include reducing costs associated with travel and brand conferences; reducing SKU complexity with an edit to amplify strategy that drives savings in our supply chain; finding efficiencies in the workforce, including the implementation of a hiring freeze and foregoing merit increases; savings related to store closures and operating stores in a more limited capacity; and reducing or eliminating other discretionary expenditures. These adjustments give us the ability to dial up or back the planned marketing investments aimed at fueling global HOKA momentum, depending on the curve of economic recovery. Our focus is to preserve the sanctity of our brands, as well as the organizations we've built to support our strong operating model. This operating model is what allows us to make better decisions with an offense focused mindset, and will ultimately establish the foundation for success on the other side of this pandemic. With our healthy cash position of $649 million that includes no debt under our credit facilities as of March 31 2020 and $469 million available on our existing lines of credit, Deckers is in a competitive liquidity position and is poised to combat the economic pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus is to make disciplined financial decisions in the best interest of the organization, while protecting the momentum and health of our brands. We are taking steps designed to put the company in a position to emerge from this crisis with a healthy balance sheet, including a strong cash position with the following considerations in mind; a current pause on share repurchase and disciplined inventory management, all paired with a focused investment in key drivers to ensure we capture demand where possible, ultimately emerging with continued strong brand positioning. Again, I'd like to reiterate that with healthy and in-demand brands, we are in a position to play offense and build on the momentum of our brands. Over the past few years, we've demonstrated the ability to course correct where necessary, and our fiscal year 2021 will be no different. As we execute our strategies, we may experience some short-term pressures on operating margins. But it is our belief that this strategy will best enable our brands to emerge stronger as we move beyond this crisis. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks. And just to add on to that a little bit, because I think you were referencing, where we gave the quarter-to-date update and talked about wholesale being down kind of mid-30%, that's really because stores are still close. So with wholesalers that have a strong online presence, they are doing well and sell through is doing well and that's what we're seeing, that's where we're also seeing a strong e-commerce business on our side. So more so what we're seeing is the result of the wholesale being down is still stores being close with our wholesale accounts, but those that are doing business online are actually doing very well and sell through as well. Yes, and we just initiated our last buy for the holiday season over the last week or so, had a lot of conversations with the wholesale team validating assumption from some of our wholesale partners. And where we decided to land is we're going to buy for reorders and in the past, we would buy a little bit more cushion on the upside. We have some good core inventory we're carrying over. We'll buy to the orders but we are expecting to see some cancellations as things progress. But the order book is also shifting between partners as people with more online presence are doing better than people with more store relevant, physical store reliance business. But it sits within the mix and then as the order book as we said still looks good and we're buying for that order book, and then we put ourselves in the chase position things are better than planned. We're doing small portion because a lot of those are smaller independent, so we're doing some of that but it's not a big part of our overall business at this time. We're available and we're offering it for sure. What I would say on the near-term is and again, what we've seen in kind of the quarter to date is with a higher proportion of e-commerce, gross margins are contributing to an improvement in margins on the higher gross margins associated with that. Some of that will shift this as the bulk of remaining quarters shift to kind of wholesale. And then I think we'll have to see as we emerge from this kind of economic pressure. But in terms of kind of some margins as a higher proportion of our business in the first few weeks of the quarter have been more heavily on e-commerce, we're seeing some margin improvement there. We'll see a little bit of a shift as we see more wholesale being fulfilled in the back half of the first quarter. And then again, not provided guidance. But as we look at the balance for the year, we'll see how things develop in terms of promotions. And then in terms of how we're thinking about the organization as we talked about, it is shifting some resources to e-commerce to help drive the increased traffic that we're seeing there. So where we're finding efficiencies in the organization and I think some of that in our e-commerce infrastructure to facilitate the increased traffic and demand that we're seeing. And then the other thing that we've talked about like which was demonstrated last year is using marketing. So, we've increased our marketing spend around that and we'll continue to use that as a lever as we evaluate kind of how sales continue to come in. And as we've been seeing for a while how the sanctity of our brand and positioning in the market is first and foremost for us. So, we've been firm on pricing and we've had conversations with some of our partners. I think you saw some of that early in the quarter and that's the way we're going to approach this. This is, we see this as a shorter term headwind for the economy and our brands. But we're in this for the long haul and we want our brands to weather through this in a quality way. We're not going to chase revenue just chasing revenue and discounting brands to get there and that's the approach. For HOKA, generally speaking, we said the distribution and is the right distribution today, I think our access points to the consumer give us a good footprint, as well as driving business or e-commerce business. We did open Dick's recently for the first time, we did a test with them like three or four years ago. They were in and out quickly and that was before people really understood what hope was all about but the test so far has been going very well. We're very pleased with that. And we're going to continue to do business with Dick's with HOKA. Really primarily seeing online and probably 10 stores and expanding the assortment a little bit right now approching Bondi, we are going to be expanding into Rincon as well. But very pleased to see the reaction from the consumer, which tells us that awareness is growing dramatically for the HOKA brand. And in an environment like that, we're competing head-to-head with some of the best brands out there and to see the response is very encouraging for us. And Tom, just to add to that. In my prepared remarks, I made the comment about kind a HOKA we're planning a little bit slower growth this year. So clearly, we will see some disruption as a result of COVID-19. But it's a short-term kind of disruption to the brand. So as Dave said, we're going to manage closely. We're going to work with the accounts. We're going to try to help accounts, where we can. And some won't make it that business will transfer to some somewhere else hopefully online. I think the first part of the question was, what is we mentioned on kind of brand growth quarter-to-date. So what we've said with was UGG was down, we didn't put -- we don't break out e-comm, but UGG is down, which is all channels down mid single-digit. HOKA up low 30% range, Teva down low 40%, Sanuk down mid 30%, but we don't necessarily break down out by channel. And DTC is, which is sales, is up 40%. stores and e-commerce combined and e-com is up triple digit Yes, I think generally speaking, probably in the 30%, 40% range in a normal environment, certainly in this environment, assuming 95% to 100% with store closures in our wholesale partners. It will be, HOKA will have a higher percentage of what they're selling online in terms of the line of products..."

I'm proud to announce that our third quarter results exceeded expectations with total company revenue increasing 7% over last year to $939 million, and delivering earnings per share of $7.14. These results represent the largest revenue and earnings quarter in the history of Deckers Brands. Our record performance was fueled by the strength of sales in our domestic UGG business, partially aided by a forward shift in consumer demand, as well as higher than anticipated sales in both our HOKA ONE ONE and Koolaburra brands. We're very pleased with our third quarter results continue to evidence success within the key initiatives that we are actively pursuing. As a reminder, these include dealing HOKA growth, which experienced 64% increase versus last year, reaching $93 million in quarterly revenue for the first time. Building the UGG men\u2019s business, which increased by 10% over last year, diversifying the UGG brand product mix again reducing reliance on core classic and fostering emerging brands with Koolaburra growing 94% versus last year, and capturing significant incremental market share. With the diversification of the UGG brand sales mix and explosive growth of both HOKA and Koolaburra, the performance demonstrated in our largest quarter underscores the progress our organization is making on these focused investments. I'm excited to share more detail on our evolution, but let's get into the brand highlight. Starting with the fashion lifestyle group. As a reminder, the fashion lifestyle group consist of our UGG and Koolaburra brand. For HOKA global sales recorded grew by 3% versus last year to $781 million, representing the brand's largest quarter in its history. Growth in the quarter for the UGG brand was driven by its domestic business as U.S. sales increased 8% over the same period last year. This domestic strength is highlighted by increased traction within the new male franchise, including meaningful contributions to the men's business, as well as extensions across women's and kid, continued strength in the Fluff franchise and significant gains in the kids footwear business. We continue to experience success within our UGG wholesale marketplace strategy in the U.S., driven by segmentation that offers differentiated consumer experiences across the breadth of our account and clean inventory in the channel through managed allocation, which has enabled the brand to open select new points of distribution, targeting younger and more fashion forward consumers. The strengths in our own domestic business is partially offset by lower international sales, which experienced the 7% decline versus last year, which was in line with our expectations. While some of the weakness in the European market is related to macroeconomic event, we are in the process of addressing some brand specific challenges that currently exist. As we have stated in our EMEA region, we were in the midst of a multiyear marketplace reset intended to reignite brand heat, rationalize marketplace inventory, consolidate the account-based with future partners who enhance the UGG brand and provide a more differentiated experience across consumer touch points. In addition, the UGG team has begun to shift towards more localized marketing, PR and digital marketing tool. We also recognize there are improvements to be made in our Asia Pacific region, and we will be taking a similar marketing approach as we work to build brand heat in our APAC region as well. Taking a look at the UGG brand product offering, we continue to make strides in the diversification of our product line. For UGG men's in the quarter, this is the third consecutive year of double digit growth, aided by investments made to drive awareness and consideration. Men's was prominently featured in both the new male marketing campaign and our holiday marketing campaign that featured the Marley family. As a result of these marketing efforts, UGG men's experienced the mid teens increase in brand consideration among all men and over 50% increase with fashion leading men according to Yugo. The new male franchise continues to be a big driver of our men success as both heritage product and new derivative styles introduced during the fall seasons help deliver strong results. In particular, the Neumel Zip and Neumel Flex sold through very well in their introductory season. We also executed two successful collaborations during the quarter with leading lifestyle brand Heron Preston and [Bae]. Both collaborations rapidly filled out of their respective pinnacle product offering. As a result of the brand's increased focus on men's messaging, products seeding with global influencers and digital marketing efforts, UGG men's experienced a near 30% increase in 18 to 34 year old consumer purchasing on ugg.com. The UGG product team has done a great job building a franchise around the new males to compliment the men's offer. Turning to our UGG women's business, we entered the holiday season with a strong setup in the U.S., highlight it by a clean wholesale channel, dedicated allocation and targeted digital marketing tactics. As a result, the women's business performed well domestically based on accelerated momentum with the younger consumer. Similar to men's in the third quarter, women's also experienced a near 30% increase in purchases with female consumers aged 18 to 34 years old in the U.S. Younger consumers gravitated to both heritage styles like the classic mini and classic short, as well as newer styles like Fluff Yeah Slide. And while styles like the Fluff Yeah were well received globally, there is still work to be done to generate greater interest in the brand's diversified product offering in our international region. Drafting off the success of both women's and men's, our global kids footwear business grew by 20% versus last year. The kids business benefited from strong partnerships with key wholesale accounts that are helping to expand consumer touch points and undoubtedly saw a positive impact from our holiday marketing campaign that emphasize the brand's offering for the whole family. The exposure and positive response to this family campaign led to the success of takedown styles from women and men, including the Fluff Yeah Slide and Neumel. The brand's result underscore the progress being made towards the more diversified product mix; as at a global level, the brand grew year-over-year with men's increasing as a percentage of brand sales; women's non-classic increasing as a percent of brand sales and total women's classic product, which includes core and derivatives, purposely declining as a percentage of brand sales, with the balance of the business, including kids and non-footwear experiencing gain. Diversifying the UGG brand's revenue composition remains top of mind, and we'll continue to focus on amplifying our heritage styles while complimenting the product offering with exciting new products rich with brand DNA. Overall, the UGG brand had an exceptional peak season, and I'd like to congratulate the team on a well executed third quarter. Turning to Koolaburra, global sales in third quarter increased by 94% versus the prior year to $39 million, delivering a few million above our guided expectations. This growth was driven by gains in market share within the domestic wholesale marketplace. Additionally, this fall, Koolaburra introduced the men's and toddler's assortment for the first time, and both product lines display strong sell through with our wholesale partners. Congratulations to the entire Koolaburra team on a fantastic quarter of record breaking revenue. Both UGG and Koolaburra have done an impressive job capturing holiday demand with great products, strong marketing and a clearly differentiated target consumer. Shifting to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk. HOKA brand global sales increased by 64% versus last year to a record $93 million. HOKA experienced growth, both domestically and internationally across all channels of distribution. The HOKA brand acquired new consumers online through brand discovery, while also seeing a migration of consumer replenishment. In the third quarter, HOKA nearly doubled number of consumers acquired on hokaoneonone.com. The HOKA brand has made great strides in creating a seamless consumer experience through the entire brand ecosystem, which includes a strong network of wholesale partners and direct to consumer channel. At the same time, our marketing efforts are focused on building brand awareness and driving consumer demand by highlighting the experiences made possible by HOKA product. The third quarter featured the launch of the HOKA brand's time-to campaign, which tells real stories of human experiences with HOKA. The campaign kicked off with the time to reimagine video, which has garnered significant impression across social platform, helping drive more than 50% increase in brand search interest according to Google Trends. From a product perspective, the brand's icon of Clifton and Bondi styles continued gaining market share in the U.S. run specialty channel. According to NPD's retail tracking service, HOKA claimed the number two brand ranking based on dollars over the summer and has maintained this position each month since, while gaining share at a steady pace. While these gains are driven by the HOKA brand's strong partnerships with wholesale accounts, the direct-to-consumer business continues to grow at a rapid pace. For the third consecutive quarter, the direct-to-consumer business doubled over the prior year. Helping to drive these gains, HOKA has also doubled the number of DTC purchasers aged 18 to 34. This has been aided by the introduction of the Rincon and Carbon X styles, as both have over-indexed with younger consumers as compared to the brand average. The HOKA product and ecommerce teams have done an impressive job of collaborating to align on product launch timing, to ensure the brand is consistently driving traffic to the Web site. During the quarter, the brand launched an update with flagship trail running shoes, the Speedgoat 4. The launch propelled the style sales to more than double last year's third quarter volume with over half the volume coming from international regions. The HOKA brand is also beginning to experience traction from the trail category beyond the Speedgoat. The Tor Ultra, featured as part of the brand's collaboration with the lifestyle brand opening ceremony, has sold well across both domestic direct-to-consumer and our Asia Pacific wholesale channel. In terms of the HOKA brand's international business overall, the brand has recent inflection points that for the first time units sold internationally for the quarter were higher than units sold domestically. We think this speaks well for the global opportunity and runway for HOKA. Moving to Teva and Sanuk. Global sales in the third quarter were in line with expectations of $17 million and $8.5 million respectively. While Teva was down year-over-year due to a shift in the timing of European distributor orders, the brand is on track to deliver its full fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, Teva will be announcing a significant brand update to coincide with the launch of its spring 2020 product line. Meanwhile, the Sanuk brand decline as it is anticipated in our guidance as it continued to face headwinds from the challenging service specialty channel, as well as the brand's decision to exit warehouse distribution. The Sanuk team remains focused on exploring healthier distribution opportunity in an effort to reposition the brand. With respect to our Q3 three channel performance, global wholesale sales increased 9% versus the prior year, driven primarily by domestic expansion in UGG, HOKA and Koolaburra, as well as international expansion of HOKA. It is worth noting that for the second consecutive year, our third quarter domestic wholesale revenue grew by double digit. International wholesale was slightly up versus the prior year due to growth in HOKA being largely offset by the UGG reset in EMEA, as well as negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rate. From a direct to consumer perspective, comparable sales increased 5% versus the prior year with total direct to consumer sales up 6% versus the third quarter last year. E-commerce continues to drive gains in the DTC channel, which has been led by the strength of UGG and HOKA. The UGG brand's DTC growth is primarily driven by domestic sales online, which included moving our annual UGG closet event up by one week compared to last year in order to improve our ability to capture end of season demand. I\u2019m very pleased by the execution of all of our brands to deliver Deckers' largest quarter in history. I'm looking forward to closing out another strong year of performance as we remain focused on delivering the fourth quarter. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our third quarter financial performance, as well as an updated outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As you just heard, our third quarter performance exceeded our expectation and speaks to the strength of our brand. The disciplined approach to investing in our brand has been a major driver of the organization's success this year as we've been able to drive brand awareness with HOKA, build brand heat with UGG, including an emphasis on men and an increase in our engagement with consumers in the digital marketplace, all while maintaining top tier levels of profitability. I'll now walk you through the third quarter results in more detail and provide an updated outlook for the fourth quarter and our full year fiscal 2020. Revenue was $939 million, up 7.4% versus last year and $39 million above the high end of our guidance range of $885 million to $900 million. Of the better than expected revenue, approximately $8 million was driven by the HOKA brand with tremendous results across the globe with our wholesale partners, as well as direct to consumer channel. $7 million was delivered by better than anticipated domestic UGG business, driven by net in-season reorders and led by the strength in kids' business, the Neumel new male franchise and the Fluff franchise, and approximately $3 million driven by reorders captured in the Koolaburra brand. With the balance of the upside performance largely timing related as we captured sales earlier in Q3 that were previously anticipated in Q4 with approximately $15 million coming from the UGG DTC business and $5 million from earlier UGG wholesale shipments. While we saw growth domestically in the UGG brand beyond our expectations, we continue to see challenges as anticipated in the UGG brand's international business, which was impacted by both brands and macro issues in our European region. Gross margins were up 30 basis points over last year to 54.1%. The gross margin result was approximately 100 basis points above our implied guidance with the beat coming from lower promotional activities and plans in our UGG domestic wholesale business, delivering strong selling and high full price sell-through for third consecutive year. While the strength of the UGG domestic wholesale margins paired with increased revenue drove improvement above our expectation, we remind mindful of the dynamic commercial environment we continue to pay as we did experienced higher promotional activity in our international market for the UGG brand as compared to last year. From an expense standpoint, our dollar spend was up 11.8% to $251.9 million compared to last year's GAAP spend of $225.4 million and up 10.6% compared to last year's non-GAAP spend of $227.8 million. As a percentage of sales, expense de-levered versus the prior year, which was aligned with our implied guidance as we continue to invest in our key initiatives. The impact of these results drove earnings per share of $7.14 compared to last year's GAAP earnings per share of $6.68, last year's non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.59 and our guidance range of $6.30 to $6.40. The $0.74 beat to the high end of our guidance range came from approximately $0.25 from sales in late December previously anticipated for early January, $0.25 from lower promotional activity in the UGG domestic wholesale business, $0.15 from better than expected HOKA results and $0.10 from higher reorders in the UGG and Koolaburra brand's domestic wholesale business. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% compared to our anticipated tax rate of 21%. Our balance sheet at December 31st remains strong as cash and equivalents were $617 million. Inventory was $366 million, up 7% versus the same point in time last year. And we have $6.6 million in short-term borrowings under our credit line as compared to $600,000 last year. With the delivery of the financial results that I've just shared with you, our third quarter execution has allowed us to once again raise our expectations for the full fiscal year. As we look forward, we placed a high importance behind controlling our distribution in UGG, focusing on growth opportunities within the UGG brand and fueling HOKA momentum across the globe. With that said and our updated outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect sales to be in the range of $392 million to $402 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. Fourth quarter revenue guidance compared to last year includes brand expectations of HOKA, expected to increase in the high 40% range; Teva expected to increase in the mid to high-teens, inclusive of a planned distributor business shift into Q4; Koolaburra up high teens; Sanuk down approximately 50% due to the previously mentioned exit of the warehouse business in the quarter; and UGG expected to be down approximately 8% to 11% due to ongoing reset and pressure in Europe, the previously mentioned timing shift into Q3. And while it's still early, a component of risk related to the potential lower DTC demand related to current travel restrictions in China. In addition, fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is further impacted by planned expense growth as we continue to fuel our growth initiatives and lower gross margins, primarily due to the Teva brands, European distributorship and continued currency pressure. Moving to the full year outlook. With the overperformance of the quarter, we are now raising our outlook for the full year. For our fiscal year 2020 guidance, we are increasing revenue guidance to now be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.16 billion, an increase of $20 million on the high end of our previous guidance range. Our updated outlook at the brand level include UGG revenue still expected to be flat to upload single digit; HOKA revenue is now expected to reach approximately $350 million; Teva revenue is still expected to be approximately flat; Sanuk revenue is still expected to be down in the mid 30% range; and Koolaburra revenue is still expected to grow to approximately $70 million. Turning to the remainder of the P&L. We are increasing our gross margin expectation to now be approximately 51.5% as we are passing through the lower promotional activity experienced in the third quarter and increasing our projection for the fourth quarter; SG&A as a percent of sales are still expected to be slightly below 36%; we are raising our operating margin to now be at or slightly better than 15.5%; and we are raising our expected earnings per share to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.50 on a share count of approximately 28.7 million shares with the full year tax rate still projected to be approximately 20.5%. Our updated guidance represents blowing through just over 50 basis points of improved operating margin, predominantly driven by the better than expected gross margin experienced in the third quarter. This improved outlook for the fiscal year, which equates to $0.45 raise in our earnings per share on the high end of our guidance, is driven by $0.25 from a lower promotional environment, $.15 cents from the HOKA brand and $0.05 from an improved outlook on the margins in the fourth quarter. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges, as well as the effect of any future share repurchases. During our second quarter earnings call in October, we provided an annual update on our sheepskin pricing. Due to current events, I would like to remind everyone we expect no change to our sheepskin cost for fiscal 2021. As is our normal course of business, we have contract in place, which are used to mitigate the impact of volatility within such commodity prices. Again, please note that sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margin and this update does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year. With that, I'll now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks Steve. As we are now in the final quarter of fiscal 2020, we are on track to deliver another year of accelerating top line revenue growth with our raised full year guidance representing 6% to 7% increase over last year. Our results continue to demonstrate that our strategies are working and are at the foundation of our organization's continued evolution. This groundwork will enable us to approach opportunities ahead with confidence, and I look forward to updating you in next year's plan during our yearend earnings call in may. In closing, I'd like to share my appreciation for the collaborative efforts demonstrated by the entire Deckers organization, and delivering our largest quarter in history. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jonathan Komp with Baird.\nJonathan Komp: I just wanted to start maybe on the margin performance and maybe a broader question about the environment during the holiday. I mean in particular looks like weather was helpful but yet, so UGG out performed and the margin was strong. And so maybe just starting with why you think the margin exceeded your expectations and then how to think about the fourth quarter, especially given the tough gross margin compares in there?\nDave Powers: Jon, this is Dave. I'll give you some context and I'll let Steve get into the specifics on that. But I think if you go back to the way that our team has been managing the brand in the marketplace with clean distribution and quality distribution and the diversification of product away from classics and we've said this before, we believe we're becoming less weather reliant. That said we did have pockets of upside based on weather throughout the quarter. But just I think what we've seen is the diversification of the product and how we're engaging with the consumers to drive that beyond this weather related products that we've had to struggle within the past. And are also seeing healthy margins, because full price sell-throughs were strong, particularly in North American market, we didn't chase top-line but promotional activity, and you're seeing some of us carry over into Q4. So while the marketplace was challenged and the department stores struggled in places, the strength of the brand and the diversification of the product and then just focusing on full price quality sales for the health of the brand's short and long-term versus chasing the top-line, those all contributed to it. We started off January a little bit soft in the North American wholesale channel and DDC as well just based on consumer trends. But we've helped clear on not promoting the brand at the expense of top-line, you're seeing that in results.\nSteve Fasching: Jon, this is Steve. As Dave said, I think what we saw was compelling product in the marketplace. We didn't have a nice setup so that definitely helped. Having clean marketplace also helped. So going into the quarter cleaner in the wholesale channel was a good setup for us. And then we did have a nice start into the quarter. So from what we implied in our guidance or what we have in our guidance, we did better on the promotion side that was largely driven in the domestic component of the business. We did have some promotions related to the international. But from what we were thinking would happen, we did 60 basis points to 80 basis points, probably a little bit better in the quarter than what we had thought related to the promotion. And then just a note on Q4, with kind of strong clean sell-through, we've increased our margin on Q4. So we removed some of that conservative promotional that we have factored into Q4.\nDave Powers: And then the last thing on Q3 is, was also helped by the strength of UGG men's at 10% growth, as well as kids augmenting some of the diversification efforts.\nJonathan Komp: And then maybe just looking forward for the UGG brand, I guess two questions. One, just when you look at some of the non-cold weather seasonal categories, so the sneakers and sandals of men, some of the other categories. Maybe just highlight some of the drivers you have coming up for UGG there and men? And then just separately the Europe reset, maybe any kind of status update on kind of where you think you are versus how long you think the reset actions may still be ongoing.\nDave Powers: You know, as we mentioned in the script, there's a couple of franchises that are emerging within UGG brand that are really resonating within younger consumer and providing what we think is healthy long term opportunity, and the first is the new male franchise. We've been building that in the men's the business over the last couple of years and we had a major campaign, called new male nation this fall, which helped tremendously to drive that business, as well as iterations in men's. We've also expanded that now into women's, and it's become a top five style in the women's business and into kids. So it's resonating with the younger more diverse consumer and that's creating some excitement in the brand, and that's a franchise that we will definitely continue to build on, both domestically and internationally. The other one, which you talked a lot about this year, is the Fluff franchise. And that showed continued strengths this past quarter. It's a big part of our focus going into Q4 and Q1 of next year. We have a lot of innovation in the pipeline that we think is going to be really exciting in expanding that franchise beyond just the current use occasion and also eventually getting some traction in the men's business as well. We actually had a lot of demand from our male consumer for Fluff Yeah product and extending that into kids as well. So those would be the two lead franchises. In addition to that, we are going aggressively after the sneaker opportunity as we have been in key markets. We just had an exciting launch in Paris, just recently with the Japanese retail partner and really continuing to ignite some excitement for the brand at the high end PR level and with exciting collaborations and influencers. With regards to EMEA, we've talked about this for a couple quarters now. We're in the midst of a multiyear reset there. I'd say we're probably just getting through year one of that reset. It's very similar to what we went through with the U.S., three or four years ago, cleaning up inventory, cleaning up distribution, focusing on controlling full-price sale through, the classics, it's a little bit more challenging there, because we can influence prices in the market like we can in the U.S. But we're working through that. There's also some macro issues happening in the UK, particularly in the Europe business right now with the retail and then Brexit et cetera. So we're taking it slow. We're looking over this, looking at this from a long-term perspective, controlling the marketplace. And as I said, we're not chasing discounting to keep the top line going. And so that's what's great about the strength in domestic businesses as we can afford to make some of those resets in EMEA for the help of the long-term, and we will continue to focus on elevating that and maintaining the strength of the classics business through the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Gulmi: This is Matt Gulmi on for Tom. Congrats on good quarter. Just couple of questions here, first on UGG. How do inventories look at retail coming out of the holidays? And then another strong quarter for HOKA. Just wondering at what point you guys think about expanding distribution of the brand? And I want to follow up on margins.\nSteve Fasching: I'll take care of the channel inventory, still good. It's up a little bit from where we were a year ago, but comfortable with the levels really that we're seeing. And the feedback that we've gotten really good strong sell through in Q3. So I think we're -- we feel good about where the inventory fit coming out of the quarter.\nDave Powers: With regards to HOKA, this is an exciting story, not only for Deckers but also for the marketplace internationally. And as we said in the call, in the script, we had success in the quarter in all regions and all channels. The momentum of the brand is exceptional. And we think things are going to continue to accelerate. From a distribution standpoint, I think one of the things that is working very well is to take control of distribution. So we don't have really broad based distribution expansion plan. In the short term, we are exploring a couple of smaller options that we'll test in the short term but really, really focused on maintaining our positioning and taking more share in the run specialty channel globally and enhancing our outdoor distribution. RAI is a critical key partner of ours and we're having great success with them and others. And that playbook is being implemented also in Europe and our APAC region and then really driving replenishment and new acquisition opportunities to our own e-commerce site. And this in the growth and that channel, as you're seeing the business but also in the margin is very strong as well. So we're going to continue down this path. We're calling it the HOKA ecosystem where we showcase the brand in a tight elevated distribution at wholesale and drive additional purchases to our Web site. And we're going to stay the course in that for a while.\nMatt Gulmi: And then just last one on margins. There's been a lot of SG&A spend this year relative to recent memory. Should we think of this year as peak investment year or how should think about that?\nSteve Fasching: I think I'll take this one and Dave can jump in. I think one of the things that we have seen, especially as a lot of the work that we've done, we've taken as part of our profit improvement plan. We've taken a lot of expense out. As we're rebuilding brand heat, as we're moving into some of the new initiatives, we are investing in those initiatives and that's where you're seeing the increase in the current year, and it's delivering results. So we think the spend is appropriate this year, we'll give guidance on kind of how we're looking at next year. But we're investing more in marketing so we're increasing that variable component of our spend, and it's something that we're going to be able to watch closely. But it's an important part with the brands growing as rapidly as they are that we continue to feel that through marketing and investment.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I would say overall, we have an excellent handle on the SG&A across the organization and the teams have done an incredible job of making sure we're tight in areas that we can leverage, but also identifying our key growth drivers across the organization, which we talked about in HOKA and UGG men's, ultimately getting to apparel, Koolaburra. And I think we're just in a unique position where we've right sized the organization, we have very healthy mid-teen operating margins. And we're allowed the opportunity to further invest in the growth of these brands, which we need to do. It's a very competitive environment. We're fighting for sharing in all of our channels. We have some challenges in EMEA that we need to work through. And Steve and I and the teams are managing this very tightly, shifting expenses from fixed to variable and being able to adjust based on the growth of the brand, and the results we're seeing in revenue, but also the return on marketing expense. So we're very happy with how things are going there. We're confident that we're making investments in the right places, and we're seeing those returns. And as long as that's the case, we're going to continue to fuel it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. \nDana Telsey: Good afternoon everyone and congratulations on the results. As you think about the same store sales that you generated this quarter, what would the components and complexion of the comp that were delivered? And lastly on the European business, what is your timeframe for the Europe business and what should we look at in terms of stepping stones to show the progress going forward? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: I'll take the first one. Our DTC comp was up 4.7%. As you know, we don't break out retail and e-com. But clearly e-com performed very strongly. I think retail for the most part was kind of within our expectations but down. And so you know it's something that we're constantly looking at. It's something that we talked about really for the last couple of years of how we're shaping our fleet and how we're improving performance. So something that we're going to continue to monitor, clearly, retail plays an important strategic element in how we go to market. And so that's going to be a continued area that we're going to look at. And it's something that we are working on and improving in some of the stores that have been underperforming. And for those that have underperformed, we've closed. So that's something that we'll continue to monitor and work as we progressed along.\nDave Powers: And with regards to the European business, and just to clarify that is an UGG specific challenge that we're having in the EMEA region. I would say, Dana, we're coming out of year one of a three year reset. Obviously, some declines that we had planned for and some challenges that I mentioned. But I would expect to see really the real indicator of brand consideration in that marketplace. We track that on a regular basis, and we'll do our best to keep everyone updated through our quarterly calls. We have a lot of internal conversations around marketing, using local influencers versus global influencers for ramping up our digital marketing tools in that region, to really drive excitement and brand consideration. And then I would say probably in FY21, you'll start to see the business level out with return to growth in FY22, at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Can we talk a little bit about China and the consumer regard and what you're seeing initially with the coronavirus, as well as they done have a lot of production there now, but also what you're seeing with the timing of production out of China as well.\nSteve Fasching: So I'll start with that and Dave can jump in. I think, as we said, we do have a factor in there, a little bit on more of the demand side. From a supply side, most of our product is coming out of Vietnam, so we haven't seen at this point any disruption from a supply side issue. As I said, we have put in an element around the demand related to China and restrictions in China. As I also said, it's still very early. So it's really hard to know where this is going to go and how it's going to end up. But at this point, with the majority of our supply coming out of Vietnam from a supply issue, we're in good shape but we'll see how things develop.\nDave Powers: Yes, I don't really have much more to add on to that. I think it's kind of a wait and see, not just for us in the marketplace, what this does to the global Chinese consumer and impacts in other regions and retail business as a result of that. We do have teams in Shanghai, we have team in Guangzhou. They are challenged. But as Steve said to the rest of the business right now, we think we've got quantified. There may be a little bit impact on internal kind of development work over the next few months. But we don't see that as a significant impact to the business going forward. But we're obviously going to continue to monitor it closely and also keeping a close eye on the health and the well being of our teams.\nSam Poser: And then secondly, in regards to HOKA, what percent of that business is -- well, I've a couple of questions there. What percent is domestic versus international and then is that entire DTC is digital? Is that correct?\nSteve Fasching: DTC is all digital at this point. Yes, correct.\nDave Powers: So back to the mix, Steve?\nSteve Fasching: On the HOKA breakout and we haven't given specific numbers. But from a dollar perspective, I think it's -- we're about two-thirds little less on domestic and one-third kind of international.\nDave Powers: And as we also mentioned, this is the first time that we saw unit sales in the Europe or the international business eclipse that in the U.S. So keep in mind there it's largely a much bigger portion of wholesale business and a large distributor business. So the average price on a product there is lower because of that. But we're excited about the unit growth, which means more shoes on more feet across the globe, which means adoption is increasing. It just gives us more excitement around the opportunity internationally.\nSam Poser: And when would you take, I mean -- when would you go to a JV and subsidiary there? At what scale do you need to think about flipping it out of the distributor model and into a subsidiary or JV model?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I'm nothing to share there right now. We're continuing to evaluate opportunities for that long-term in all regions. And so, right now we're staying the course and building brand helping our subsidiary market, supporting the distributors. We have actually done that with our Canadian market. So this will be the first year in FY21 that is fully owned and run by us. We did that in Japan about three or four years ago, and it proved very successful. So it's something we're considering as we look at the long-term strategic outlook of this, and making sure that operationally we are ready to do that if we get to that point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nPeter McGoldrick: Hi, this is Peter McGoldrick on for Jim. Thanks for taking my question. I was first interested, as HOKA continues to deliver outside to the plan. Where are you seeing the increases in brand recognition? And then further, can you speak to the brand marketing and product strategy as you look to recruit younger consumers? And as this evolved at all, have you grown with scale?\nDave Powers: I think to answer the question, two areas that we're seeing work well is new product introduction, so the Carbon X and Rincon. Those are resonating with the younger consumer, consumers who want to go faster but still want the overall benefits from the cushion experience that HOKA provides. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're going to continue the formula we're using real consumer experiences in HOKA product to tell that. So leveraging the time-to campaign, making sure that we're reaching diverse consumers as we have been and really cultivating younger consumers through some of the efforts that the field marketing reps are doing across the region, continuing to show up in the right events globally, staying authentic to the channel, continuing to innovate at a fast pace. And what's great now about the breadth of the brand is it is being adopted by a large diverse consumer across the board. And we are seeing growth and excitement and penetration into the younger consumer. So we're just going to continue to cultivate that and you'll see that in increased marketing spend and the approach that we're taking. In the product pipeline, we'll continue to build on the successes that we've had in our core franchises of Bondai and Clifton and speed go. The Carbon X product is going to continue to evolve. And we're looking at great opportunities to expand that across the board. And we're very pleased with the introduction of the Rincon product and see that as a key evolution going forward as well.\nPeter McGoldrick: Then on the sourcing situation, I know that you're locked in on sheepskin for next year, given the drought and fire situations in Australia. Can you help us think about any risks that you may be considering for fiscal '22 or the size of any exposure there? \nSteve Fasching: Yes, normally we give that update but I can give you just a little bit of clarity. So we're covered into 2022 so we're fully covered for 2021 and we're comfortably covered for 2022, and we'll be able to provide more of an update. But the supply that we have locked in we feel comfortable with the position that we have really definitely over the next year and well into 2022.\nDave Powers: And in addition to that, keep in mind that we have been leveraging the development of UGGpure and materials as an alternative to pure sheepskin, that's growing as a proportion for the line as we get into more diverse product and more fashionable product and different price points that balances out the demand for twin phase sheepskin and it's also helping margin and retail opportunities as well.\nPeter McGoldrick: Then last one with holiday '19 in the bag. Can you give us an update on how big the core classics franchise is, and how much bigger that is than any emergent franchises like Neumel or Fluff Yeah?\nSteve Fasching: So total women's classics, you know we've been hovering in the last few years below 50%. We're now turning closer to 40%, just seen above 40%. So part of that is on purpose with how we're controlling distribution allocation of the women's classics franchise. And some of that is also bolstered by the fact that you are seeing success in men's in other areas, such as the Fluff Yeah, and that strategy's working. We have more progress that we need to make in the international markets. Those are still a little bit more heavily penetrated, some of the in the core classics. But as the adoption of the Neumel and the Fluff, you know the categories increased in those markets and we finished out the segmentation and allocation work, we hope to see the same results in those international markets and being less reliant overall.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Just curious how you're thinking about the long term margin in the HOKA business, and how you balance the pace of margin expansion with investments necessary in that business. And also curious on HOKA, what percent of the HOKA business is footwear versus other categories? And how do you see that progressing over the next several years? Thanks.\nDave Powers: I'll answer the second question first and I'll let Steve answer the first one. Currently, HOKA is part of about 99% footwear. And when you look at the long range opportunity in the brand and we've talked about getting two and beyond the $500 million point, there's a lot of runway still within just footwear. We're for incubating apparels. There is going to be a launch that's coming out in the next quarter, which is a GDC only launch in the U.S. to see what the appetite is for apparel and test. But the teams are 100% focused on evolving the footwear business, continuing to take market share. But we do see longer term, three to five years down the road that this can be a much bigger brand beyond just footwear. And we think apparel and gear is an opportunity within that as well.\nSteve Fasching: And then, Paul, the way we're thinking about the margin, it depends on a number of factors. But clearly, on the domestic business where we have opportunity for margin improvement is with migration of more customers online. And we have seen that happening and that's helping drive some upside on the margin. So as we've talked about before, as consumers are introduced to the brand through the wholesale channel, there is a migration online as they get further down into repeat purchases. So we're continuing to see that trend, probably a little bit stronger than what we earlier identified. And then to the question earlier that we got, as we look at international markets, the further opportunity there is how we capture sales, both from our own market in the wholesale distributor markets, conversion to online business. So a lot more opportunity to drive the higher margin business, but we're still growing the brand. So we're bringing customers in, it's about how we're bringing customers in through all channels. And as they further engage with the brand, our opportunity is how we engage with them online and drive that margin for them.\nDave Powers: And the mix of online business as a percentage of the total, if that increases, obviously, the margin gets exponentially better, and we're able to capture that consumer for the long-term lifetime value of that sale. And then our digital marketing efforts and our return on digital marketing spend against our Web site is exceptional, so we're going to continue to fuel that at the pace of the growth that we're seeing.\nPaul Lejuez: Can I just go back to the China question for a second? Can you just remind us what percentage of you sales are in China? And I think you didn't indicate any sort of percentage of your sourcing coming from China. Did you mean to be that that you don't have anything sourced in China at this point? And I'm just curious what that percentage is? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Right now, where we're at with sourcing coming from China is it's about 10%, maybe a little bit less, and so we've factored that into the -- what we spoke about earlier with the risk and then the long range view of the company and margin opportunity [Multiple Speakers] 10% of shipments that are at risk coming out of that market. And as you know, the teams have done a fantastic job. I have to give them credit for migrating out of China over the last three years. Not only have we quickly migrated to new markets in Vietnam and beyond, but the quality of our product has improved overtime and the margins have improved as results.\nPaul Lejuez: And percent of sales from China?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, what we've said specifically to that is one kind of in the current quarter what we factored in and still relatively small. In terms of international markets, we've said about half of that is Europe, 40-ish percent of that is APAC. And when you look at APAC, it's now kind of split between China and Japan largely.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.\nMitch Kummetz: I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the UGG men's business, I think you said it was up 10% in the quarter. What percent of total UGG is men's now? And then it sounded like Neumel was particularly strong. I don't know if you could speak to how much year-over-year growth you saw in Neumel. And then I have a follow up.\nSteve Fasching: Right now, men's is tracking as we planned it. As you know, we've been talking about this for the last few years now and migrating men to younger, more fashion oriented consumer with different distribution away from the traditional slipper and classic business. We're now at about 15% of the total penetration. We think the potential there is closer to 20% over time. But it's really being driven by the Neumel franchise and some of the winter boots in that business. So the Neumel has continued to resonate, both their core distribution but also at new distribution like the Footlocker and Footaction, real strength in journeys. We've opened up some sport lifestyle distribution in the EMEA market, which is starting to perform well. It hasn't resonated to the same extent in Europe and Asia that it has in the U.S. yet, but it's an early days of introduction at that consumer. So we're leveraging the marketing playbook that has worked well in the U.S., which is collaborations and high level influencers and ambassadors for the brand, showing the product in a new and exciting way and we're going to continue down that path. At the same time, we're seeing success in derivatives of that, the Harkland boot which is little bit slimmer and more appropriate to an international consumer, leveraging the Butte franchise, which is our leading winter boot and then leveraging existing styles like the Tasman slipper, which is also being worn by younger high school, college age students. So we feel good about the reach of the consumer and the diversity of the product, and the teams are working very fast to iterate as much as we can and to take advantage of the opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier on, there is also opportunity we think in the Fluff franchise to translate that to the male consumer as well.\nMitch Kummetz: And then, Steve, just real quickly on the Q3 beat. I think you said that roughly $20 million of the sales outside was timing, $5 million of that was wholesale and I get that. You should able to see if there orders told forward or not. Then you also said that $15 million was DTC. I just want to have a better sense as to how you can tie or how you can engage the timing of DTC? How do you know that that's timing versus just outperformance in the quarter?\nSteve Fasching: So one thing we did this year is we've pulled forward our closet event. So last year, we had it in January. This year we pulled it into the last week of December. And we saw two things; one, we saw it perform but we saw it perform better than what we expected; and we did see a corresponding low to the start of January. So you know that was the case where we saw products selling stronger in that last week where we thought some of that might trickle really into the first part of January. And so capturing that sale late in December and the low, we put the timing as people were buying the product earlier.\nDave Powers: You know, because makes sense\u2026\nOperator: We will now take the last question of the call from Janine Stichter with Jefferies.\nJanine Stichter: Just one more on HOKA, so really impressive growth there. Is there anything in terms of capacity constraints that would prohibit you from growing at the level that you've been growing in the coming quarters? And then also just one on Koolaburra, that's been a small brand obviously and it's kind of becoming a little bit more noticeable. How should we think about the potential growth there? And then if you could just help us understand how much of the growth is coming from expanded distribution versus just better sell-through with your existing partners? Thank you.\nDave Powers: So on the capacity, it's a great question. And first I would say I give the teams a lot of credit. This explosive growth is a lot more than we had anticipated or planned for. So the teams have been able to quickly chase not only production capacity but materials and be able to keep the fuel -- the flow of inventory in those core products to the extent that we're not really missing sales, but we are capitalizing on the opportunity. And we've had great discussions internally on making sure that we are preparing for continued acceleration of that brand, working closely with our partners, the teams have been over in China within the last month and a half, working closely with our factory partners, both on machinery to be able to produce the shoes but also the capacity. And we feel really good about our opportunity to continue this rate of growth. With regards to Koolaburra, we're very excited about the reaction to the brand by the consumer, how they are -- how that brand is performing at retail and at the retail prices that consumers are paying for it. We've had a great, obviously, initial launch over the last couple years with Kohl's. Footwear business is strong. We actually just launched, if you guys haven\u2019t noticed. This fall we had a home launch with them through our license partner, which was also very successful at Kohl's. We're looking at ways to expand that as well. We're not really looking to expand distribution for Kohl's. It\u2019s really around penetration and existing partners. And then there's opportunity to expand the business in Europe. We had a soft launch this fall, things went well. We had some little bit of late deliveries on products, so we didn't capitalize on the full opportunity. But it is going to be something that we're going to continue to go after. And we're looking at this longer term as not just a footwear brand but really a lifestyle brand. And we're incubating business opportunities to be able to capture that now.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'm proud to announce that our third quarter results exceeded expectations with total company revenue increasing 7% over last year to $939 million, and delivering earnings per share of $7.14. These results represent the largest revenue and earnings quarter in the history of Deckers Brands. Our record performance was fueled by the strength of sales in our domestic UGG business, partially aided by a forward shift in consumer demand, as well as higher than anticipated sales in both our HOKA ONE ONE and Koolaburra brands. We're very pleased with our third quarter results continue to evidence success within the key initiatives that we are actively pursuing. As a reminder, these include dealing HOKA growth, which experienced 64% increase versus last year, reaching $93 million in quarterly revenue for the first time. Building the UGG men's business, which increased by 10% over last year, diversifying the UGG brand product mix again reducing reliance on core classic and fostering emerging brands with Koolaburra growing 94% versus last year, and capturing significant incremental market share. With the diversification of the UGG brand sales mix and explosive growth of both HOKA and Koolaburra, the performance demonstrated in our largest quarter underscores the progress our organization is making on these focused investments. I'm excited to share more detail on our evolution, but let's get into the brand highlight. Starting with the fashion lifestyle group. As a reminder, the fashion lifestyle group consist of our UGG and Koolaburra brand. For HOKA global sales recorded grew by 3% versus last year to $781 million, representing the brand's largest quarter in its history. Growth in the quarter for the UGG brand was driven by its domestic business as U.S. sales increased 8% over the same period last year. This domestic strength is highlighted by increased traction within the new male franchise, including meaningful contributions to the men's business, as well as extensions across women's and kid, continued strength in the Fluff franchise and significant gains in the kids footwear business. We continue to experience success within our UGG wholesale marketplace strategy in the U.S., driven by segmentation that offers differentiated consumer experiences across the breadth of our account and clean inventory in the channel through managed allocation, which has enabled the brand to open select new points of distribution, targeting younger and more fashion forward consumers. The strengths in our own domestic business is partially offset by lower international sales, which experienced the 7% decline versus last year, which was in line with our expectations. While some of the weakness in the European market is related to macroeconomic event, we are in the process of addressing some brand specific challenges that currently exist. As we have stated in our EMEA region, we were in the midst of a multiyear marketplace reset intended to reignite brand heat, rationalize marketplace inventory, consolidate the account-based with future partners who enhance the UGG brand and provide a more differentiated experience across consumer touch points. In addition, the UGG team has begun to shift towards more localized marketing, PR and digital marketing tool. We also recognize there are improvements to be made in our Asia Pacific region, and we will be taking a similar marketing approach as we work to build brand heat in our APAC region as well. Taking a look at the UGG brand product offering, we continue to make strides in the diversification of our product line. For UGG men's in the quarter, this is the third consecutive year of double digit growth, aided by investments made to drive awareness and consideration. Men's was prominently featured in both the new male marketing campaign and our holiday marketing campaign that featured the Marley family. As a result of these marketing efforts, UGG men's experienced the mid teens increase in brand consideration among all men and over 50% increase with fashion leading men according to Yugo. The new male franchise continues to be a big driver of our men success as both heritage product and new derivative styles introduced during the fall seasons help deliver strong results. In particular, the Neumel Zip and Neumel Flex sold through very well in their introductory season. We also executed two successful collaborations during the quarter with leading lifestyle brand Heron Preston and [Bae]. Both collaborations rapidly filled out of their respective pinnacle product offering. As a result of the brand's increased focus on men's messaging, products seeding with global influencers and digital marketing efforts, UGG men's experienced a near 30% increase in 18 to 34 year old consumer purchasing on ugg.com. The UGG product team has done a great job building a franchise around the new males to compliment the men's offer. Turning to our UGG women's business, we entered the holiday season with a strong setup in the U.S., highlight it by a clean wholesale channel, dedicated allocation and targeted digital marketing tactics. As a result, the women's business performed well domestically based on accelerated momentum with the younger consumer. Similar to men's in the third quarter, women's also experienced a near 30% increase in purchases with female consumers aged 18 to 34 years old in the U.S. Younger consumers gravitated to both heritage styles like the classic mini and classic short, as well as newer styles like Fluff Yeah Slide. And while styles like the Fluff Yeah were well received globally, there is still work to be done to generate greater interest in the brand's diversified product offering in our international region. Drafting off the success of both women's and men's, our global kids footwear business grew by 20% versus last year. The kids business benefited from strong partnerships with key wholesale accounts that are helping to expand consumer touch points and undoubtedly saw a positive impact from our holiday marketing campaign that emphasize the brand's offering for the whole family. The exposure and positive response to this family campaign led to the success of takedown styles from women and men, including the Fluff Yeah Slide and Neumel. The brand's result underscore the progress being made towards the more diversified product mix; as at a global level, the brand grew year-over-year with men's increasing as a percentage of brand sales; women's non-classic increasing as a percent of brand sales and total women's classic product, which includes core and derivatives, purposely declining as a percentage of brand sales, with the balance of the business, including kids and non-footwear experiencing gain. Diversifying the UGG brand's revenue composition remains top of mind, and we'll continue to focus on amplifying our heritage styles while complimenting the product offering with exciting new products rich with brand DNA. Overall, the UGG brand had an exceptional peak season, and I'd like to congratulate the team on a well executed third quarter. Turning to Koolaburra, global sales in third quarter increased by 94% versus the prior year to $39 million, delivering a few million above our guided expectations. This growth was driven by gains in market share within the domestic wholesale marketplace. Additionally, this fall, Koolaburra introduced the men's and toddler's assortment for the first time, and both product lines display strong sell through with our wholesale partners. Congratulations to the entire Koolaburra team on a fantastic quarter of record breaking revenue. Both UGG and Koolaburra have done an impressive job capturing holiday demand with great products, strong marketing and a clearly differentiated target consumer. Shifting to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk. HOKA brand global sales increased by 64% versus last year to a record $93 million. HOKA experienced growth, both domestically and internationally across all channels of distribution. The HOKA brand acquired new consumers online through brand discovery, while also seeing a migration of consumer replenishment. In the third quarter, HOKA nearly doubled number of consumers acquired on hokaoneonone.com. The HOKA brand has made great strides in creating a seamless consumer experience through the entire brand ecosystem, which includes a strong network of wholesale partners and direct to consumer channel. At the same time, our marketing efforts are focused on building brand awareness and driving consumer demand by highlighting the experiences made possible by HOKA product. The third quarter featured the launch of the HOKA brand's time-to campaign, which tells real stories of human experiences with HOKA. The campaign kicked off with the time to reimagine video, which has garnered significant impression across social platform, helping drive more than 50% increase in brand search interest according to Google Trends. From a product perspective, the brand's icon of Clifton and Bondi styles continued gaining market share in the U.S. run specialty channel. According to NPD's retail tracking service, HOKA claimed the number two brand ranking based on dollars over the summer and has maintained this position each month since, while gaining share at a steady pace. While these gains are driven by the HOKA brand's strong partnerships with wholesale accounts, the direct-to-consumer business continues to grow at a rapid pace. For the third consecutive quarter, the direct-to-consumer business doubled over the prior year. Helping to drive these gains, HOKA has also doubled the number of DTC purchasers aged 18 to 34. This has been aided by the introduction of the Rincon and Carbon X styles, as both have over-indexed with younger consumers as compared to the brand average. The HOKA product and ecommerce teams have done an impressive job of collaborating to align on product launch timing, to ensure the brand is consistently driving traffic to the Web site. During the quarter, the brand launched an update with flagship trail running shoes, the Speedgoat 4. The launch propelled the style sales to more than double last year's third quarter volume with over half the volume coming from international regions. The HOKA brand is also beginning to experience traction from the trail category beyond the Speedgoat. The Tor Ultra, featured as part of the brand's collaboration with the lifestyle brand opening ceremony, has sold well across both domestic direct-to-consumer and our Asia Pacific wholesale channel. In terms of the HOKA brand's international business overall, the brand has recent inflection points that for the first time units sold internationally for the quarter were higher than units sold domestically. We think this speaks well for the global opportunity and runway for HOKA. Moving to Teva and Sanuk. Global sales in the third quarter were in line with expectations of $17 million and $8.5 million respectively. While Teva was down year-over-year due to a shift in the timing of European distributor orders, the brand is on track to deliver its full fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, Teva will be announcing a significant brand update to coincide with the launch of its spring 2020 product line. Meanwhile, the Sanuk brand decline as it is anticipated in our guidance as it continued to face headwinds from the challenging service specialty channel, as well as the brand's decision to exit warehouse distribution. The Sanuk team remains focused on exploring healthier distribution opportunity in an effort to reposition the brand. With respect to our Q3 three channel performance, global wholesale sales increased 9% versus the prior year, driven primarily by domestic expansion in UGG, HOKA and Koolaburra, as well as international expansion of HOKA. It is worth noting that for the second consecutive year, our third quarter domestic wholesale revenue grew by double digit. International wholesale was slightly up versus the prior year due to growth in HOKA being largely offset by the UGG reset in EMEA, as well as negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rate. From a direct to consumer perspective, comparable sales increased 5% versus the prior year with total direct to consumer sales up 6% versus the third quarter last year. E-commerce continues to drive gains in the DTC channel, which has been led by the strength of UGG and HOKA. The UGG brand's DTC growth is primarily driven by domestic sales online, which included moving our annual UGG closet event up by one week compared to last year in order to improve our ability to capture end of season demand. I'm very pleased by the execution of all of our brands to deliver Deckers' largest quarter in history. I'm looking forward to closing out another strong year of performance as we remain focused on delivering the fourth quarter. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our third quarter financial performance, as well as an updated outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Thanks Steve. As we are now in the final quarter of fiscal 2020, we are on track to deliver another year of accelerating top line revenue growth with our raised full year guidance representing 6% to 7% increase over last year. Our results continue to demonstrate that our strategies are working and are at the foundation of our organization's continued evolution. This groundwork will enable us to approach opportunities ahead with confidence, and I look forward to updating you in next year's plan during our yearend earnings call in may. In closing, I'd like to share my appreciation for the collaborative efforts demonstrated by the entire Deckers organization, and delivering our largest quarter in history. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Operator? Jon, this is Dave. I'll give you some context and I'll let Steve get into the specifics on that. But I think if you go back to the way that our team has been managing the brand in the marketplace with clean distribution and quality distribution and the diversification of product away from classics and we've said this before, we believe we're becoming less weather reliant. That said we did have pockets of upside based on weather throughout the quarter. But just I think what we've seen is the diversification of the product and how we're engaging with the consumers to drive that beyond this weather related products that we've had to struggle within the past. And are also seeing healthy margins, because full price sell-throughs were strong, particularly in North American market, we didn't chase top-line but promotional activity, and you're seeing some of us carry over into Q4. So while the marketplace was challenged and the department stores struggled in places, the strength of the brand and the diversification of the product and then just focusing on full price quality sales for the health of the brand's short and long-term versus chasing the top-line, those all contributed to it. We started off January a little bit soft in the North American wholesale channel and DDC as well just based on consumer trends. But we've helped clear on not promoting the brand at the expense of top-line, you're seeing that in results. And then the last thing on Q3 is, was also helped by the strength of UGG men's at 10% growth, as well as kids augmenting some of the diversification efforts. You know, as we mentioned in the script, there's a couple of franchises that are emerging within UGG brand that are really resonating within younger consumer and providing what we think is healthy long term opportunity, and the first is the new male franchise. We've been building that in the men's the business over the last couple of years and we had a major campaign, called new male nation this fall, which helped tremendously to drive that business, as well as iterations in men's. We've also expanded that now into women's, and it's become a top five style in the women's business and into kids. So it's resonating with the younger more diverse consumer and that's creating some excitement in the brand, and that's a franchise that we will definitely continue to build on, both domestically and internationally. The other one, which you talked a lot about this year, is the Fluff franchise. And that showed continued strengths this past quarter. It's a big part of our focus going into Q4 and Q1 of next year. We have a lot of innovation in the pipeline that we think is going to be really exciting in expanding that franchise beyond just the current use occasion and also eventually getting some traction in the men's business as well. We actually had a lot of demand from our male consumer for Fluff Yeah product and extending that into kids as well. So those would be the two lead franchises. In addition to that, we are going aggressively after the sneaker opportunity as we have been in key markets. We just had an exciting launch in Paris, just recently with the Japanese retail partner and really continuing to ignite some excitement for the brand at the high end PR level and with exciting collaborations and influencers. With regards to EMEA, we've talked about this for a couple quarters now. We're in the midst of a multiyear reset there. I'd say we're probably just getting through year one of that reset. It's very similar to what we went through with the U.S., three or four years ago, cleaning up inventory, cleaning up distribution, focusing on controlling full-price sale through, the classics, it's a little bit more challenging there, because we can influence prices in the market like we can in the U.S. But we're working through that. There's also some macro issues happening in the UK, particularly in the Europe business right now with the retail and then Brexit et cetera. So we're taking it slow. We're looking over this, looking at this from a long-term perspective, controlling the marketplace. And as I said, we're not chasing discounting to keep the top line going. And so that's what's great about the strength in domestic businesses as we can afford to make some of those resets in EMEA for the help of the long-term, and we will continue to focus on elevating that and maintaining the strength of the classics business through the next couple of years. With regards to HOKA, this is an exciting story, not only for Deckers but also for the marketplace internationally. And as we said in the call, in the script, we had success in the quarter in all regions and all channels. The momentum of the brand is exceptional. And we think things are going to continue to accelerate. From a distribution standpoint, I think one of the things that is working very well is to take control of distribution. So we don't have really broad based distribution expansion plan. In the short term, we are exploring a couple of smaller options that we'll test in the short term but really, really focused on maintaining our positioning and taking more share in the run specialty channel globally and enhancing our outdoor distribution. RAI is a critical key partner of ours and we're having great success with them and others. And that playbook is being implemented also in Europe and our APAC region and then really driving replenishment and new acquisition opportunities to our own e-commerce site. And this in the growth and that channel, as you're seeing the business but also in the margin is very strong as well. So we're going to continue down this path. We're calling it the HOKA ecosystem where we showcase the brand in a tight elevated distribution at wholesale and drive additional purchases to our Web site. And we're going to stay the course in that for a while. Yes. And I would say overall, we have an excellent handle on the SG&A across the organization and the teams have done an incredible job of making sure we're tight in areas that we can leverage, but also identifying our key growth drivers across the organization, which we talked about in HOKA and UGG men's, ultimately getting to apparel, Koolaburra. And I think we're just in a unique position where we've right sized the organization, we have very healthy mid-teen operating margins. And we're allowed the opportunity to further invest in the growth of these brands, which we need to do. It's a very competitive environment. We're fighting for sharing in all of our channels. We have some challenges in EMEA that we need to work through. And Steve and I and the teams are managing this very tightly, shifting expenses from fixed to variable and being able to adjust based on the growth of the brand, and the results we're seeing in revenue, but also the return on marketing expense. So we're very happy with how things are going there. We're confident that we're making investments in the right places, and we're seeing those returns. And as long as that's the case, we're going to continue to fuel it. And with regards to the European business, and just to clarify that is an UGG specific challenge that we're having in the EMEA region. I would say, Dana, we're coming out of year one of a three year reset. Obviously, some declines that we had planned for and some challenges that I mentioned. But I would expect to see really the real indicator of brand consideration in that marketplace. We track that on a regular basis, and we'll do our best to keep everyone updated through our quarterly calls. We have a lot of internal conversations around marketing, using local influencers versus global influencers for ramping up our digital marketing tools in that region, to really drive excitement and brand consideration. And then I would say probably in FY21, you'll start to see the business level out with return to growth in FY22, at this point. Yes, I don't really have much more to add on to that. I think it's kind of a wait and see, not just for us in the marketplace, what this does to the global Chinese consumer and impacts in other regions and retail business as a result of that. We do have teams in Shanghai, we have team in Guangzhou. They are challenged. But as Steve said to the rest of the business right now, we think we've got quantified. There may be a little bit impact on internal kind of development work over the next few months. But we don't see that as a significant impact to the business going forward. But we're obviously going to continue to monitor it closely and also keeping a close eye on the health and the well being of our teams. So back to the mix, Steve? And as we also mentioned, this is the first time that we saw unit sales in the Europe or the international business eclipse that in the U.S. So keep in mind there it's largely a much bigger portion of wholesale business and a large distributor business. So the average price on a product there is lower because of that. But we're excited about the unit growth, which means more shoes on more feet across the globe, which means adoption is increasing. It just gives us more excitement around the opportunity internationally. I think to answer the question, two areas that we're seeing work well is new product introduction, so the Carbon X and Rincon. Those are resonating with the younger consumer, consumers who want to go faster but still want the overall benefits from the cushion experience that HOKA provides. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're going to continue the formula we're using real consumer experiences in HOKA product to tell that. So leveraging the time-to campaign, making sure that we're reaching diverse consumers as we have been and really cultivating younger consumers through some of the efforts that the field marketing reps are doing across the region, continuing to show up in the right events globally, staying authentic to the channel, continuing to innovate at a fast pace. And what's great now about the breadth of the brand is it is being adopted by a large diverse consumer across the board. And we are seeing growth and excitement and penetration into the younger consumer. So we're just going to continue to cultivate that and you'll see that in increased marketing spend and the approach that we're taking. In the product pipeline, we'll continue to build on the successes that we've had in our core franchises of Bondai and Clifton and speed go. The Carbon X product is going to continue to evolve. And we're looking at great opportunities to expand that across the board. And we're very pleased with the introduction of the Rincon product and see that as a key evolution going forward as well. And in addition to that, keep in mind that we have been leveraging the development of UGGpure and materials as an alternative to pure sheepskin, that's growing as a proportion for the line as we get into more diverse product and more fashionable product and different price points that balances out the demand for twin phase sheepskin and it's also helping margin and retail opportunities as well. I'll answer the second question first and I'll let Steve answer the first one. Currently, HOKA is part of about 99% footwear. And when you look at the long range opportunity in the brand and we've talked about getting two and beyond the $500 million point, there's a lot of runway still within just footwear. We're for incubating apparels. There is going to be a launch that's coming out in the next quarter, which is a GDC only launch in the U.S. to see what the appetite is for apparel and test. But the teams are 100% focused on evolving the footwear business, continuing to take market share. But we do see longer term, three to five years down the road that this can be a much bigger brand beyond just footwear. And we think apparel and gear is an opportunity within that as well. And the mix of online business as a percentage of the total, if that increases, obviously, the margin gets exponentially better, and we're able to capture that consumer for the long-term lifetime value of that sale. And then our digital marketing efforts and our return on digital marketing spend against our Web site is exceptional, so we're going to continue to fuel that at the pace of the growth that we're seeing. Right now, where we're at with sourcing coming from China is it's about 10%, maybe a little bit less, and so we've factored that into the -- what we spoke about earlier with the risk and then the long range view of the company and margin opportunity [Multiple Speakers] 10% of shipments that are at risk coming out of that market. And as you know, the teams have done a fantastic job. I have to give them credit for migrating out of China over the last three years. Not only have we quickly migrated to new markets in Vietnam and beyond, but the quality of our product has improved overtime and the margins have improved as results. You know, because makes sense... So on the capacity, it's a great question. And first I would say I give the teams a lot of credit. This explosive growth is a lot more than we had anticipated or planned for. So the teams have been able to quickly chase not only production capacity but materials and be able to keep the fuel -- the flow of inventory in those core products to the extent that we're not really missing sales, but we are capitalizing on the opportunity. And we've had great discussions internally on making sure that we are preparing for continued acceleration of that brand, working closely with our partners, the teams have been over in China within the last month and a half, working closely with our factory partners, both on machinery to be able to produce the shoes but also the capacity. And we feel really good about our opportunity to continue this rate of growth. With regards to Koolaburra, we're very excited about the reaction to the brand by the consumer, how they are -- how that brand is performing at retail and at the retail prices that consumers are paying for it. We've had a great, obviously, initial launch over the last couple years with Kohl's. Footwear business is strong. We actually just launched, if you guys haven't noticed. This fall we had a home launch with them through our license partner, which was also very successful at Kohl's. We're looking at ways to expand that as well. We're not really looking to expand distribution for Kohl's. It's really around penetration and existing partners. And then there's opportunity to expand the business in Europe. We had a soft launch this fall, things went well. We had some little bit of late deliveries on products, so we didn't capitalize on the full opportunity. But it is going to be something that we're going to continue to go after. And we're looking at this longer term as not just a footwear brand but really a lifestyle brand. And we're incubating business opportunities to be able to capture that now."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As you just heard, our third quarter performance exceeded our expectation and speaks to the strength of our brand. The disciplined approach to investing in our brand has been a major driver of the organization's success this year as we've been able to drive brand awareness with HOKA, build brand heat with UGG, including an emphasis on men and an increase in our engagement with consumers in the digital marketplace, all while maintaining top tier levels of profitability. I'll now walk you through the third quarter results in more detail and provide an updated outlook for the fourth quarter and our full year fiscal 2020. Revenue was $939 million, up 7.4% versus last year and $39 million above the high end of our guidance range of $885 million to $900 million. Of the better than expected revenue, approximately $8 million was driven by the HOKA brand with tremendous results across the globe with our wholesale partners, as well as direct to consumer channel. $7 million was delivered by better than anticipated domestic UGG business, driven by net in-season reorders and led by the strength in kids' business, the Neumel new male franchise and the Fluff franchise, and approximately $3 million driven by reorders captured in the Koolaburra brand. With the balance of the upside performance largely timing related as we captured sales earlier in Q3 that were previously anticipated in Q4 with approximately $15 million coming from the UGG DTC business and $5 million from earlier UGG wholesale shipments. While we saw growth domestically in the UGG brand beyond our expectations, we continue to see challenges as anticipated in the UGG brand's international business, which was impacted by both brands and macro issues in our European region. Gross margins were up 30 basis points over last year to 54.1%. The gross margin result was approximately 100 basis points above our implied guidance with the beat coming from lower promotional activities and plans in our UGG domestic wholesale business, delivering strong selling and high full price sell-through for third consecutive year. While the strength of the UGG domestic wholesale margins paired with increased revenue drove improvement above our expectation, we remind mindful of the dynamic commercial environment we continue to pay as we did experienced higher promotional activity in our international market for the UGG brand as compared to last year. From an expense standpoint, our dollar spend was up 11.8% to $251.9 million compared to last year's GAAP spend of $225.4 million and up 10.6% compared to last year's non-GAAP spend of $227.8 million. As a percentage of sales, expense de-levered versus the prior year, which was aligned with our implied guidance as we continue to invest in our key initiatives. The impact of these results drove earnings per share of $7.14 compared to last year's GAAP earnings per share of $6.68, last year's non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.59 and our guidance range of $6.30 to $6.40. The $0.74 beat to the high end of our guidance range came from approximately $0.25 from sales in late December previously anticipated for early January, $0.25 from lower promotional activity in the UGG domestic wholesale business, $0.15 from better than expected HOKA results and $0.10 from higher reorders in the UGG and Koolaburra brand's domestic wholesale business. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.4% compared to our anticipated tax rate of 21%. Our balance sheet at December 31st remains strong as cash and equivalents were $617 million. Inventory was $366 million, up 7% versus the same point in time last year. And we have $6.6 million in short-term borrowings under our credit line as compared to $600,000 last year. With the delivery of the financial results that I've just shared with you, our third quarter execution has allowed us to once again raise our expectations for the full fiscal year. As we look forward, we placed a high importance behind controlling our distribution in UGG, focusing on growth opportunities within the UGG brand and fueling HOKA momentum across the globe. With that said and our updated outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect sales to be in the range of $392 million to $402 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. Fourth quarter revenue guidance compared to last year includes brand expectations of HOKA, expected to increase in the high 40% range; Teva expected to increase in the mid to high-teens, inclusive of a planned distributor business shift into Q4; Koolaburra up high teens; Sanuk down approximately 50% due to the previously mentioned exit of the warehouse business in the quarter; and UGG expected to be down approximately 8% to 11% due to ongoing reset and pressure in Europe, the previously mentioned timing shift into Q3. And while it's still early, a component of risk related to the potential lower DTC demand related to current travel restrictions in China. In addition, fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is further impacted by planned expense growth as we continue to fuel our growth initiatives and lower gross margins, primarily due to the Teva brands, European distributorship and continued currency pressure. Moving to the full year outlook. With the overperformance of the quarter, we are now raising our outlook for the full year. For our fiscal year 2020 guidance, we are increasing revenue guidance to now be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.16 billion, an increase of $20 million on the high end of our previous guidance range. Our updated outlook at the brand level include UGG revenue still expected to be flat to upload single digit; HOKA revenue is now expected to reach approximately $350 million; Teva revenue is still expected to be approximately flat; Sanuk revenue is still expected to be down in the mid 30% range; and Koolaburra revenue is still expected to grow to approximately $70 million. Turning to the remainder of the P&L. We are increasing our gross margin expectation to now be approximately 51.5% as we are passing through the lower promotional activity experienced in the third quarter and increasing our projection for the fourth quarter; SG&A as a percent of sales are still expected to be slightly below 36%; we are raising our operating margin to now be at or slightly better than 15.5%; and we are raising our expected earnings per share to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.50 on a share count of approximately 28.7 million shares with the full year tax rate still projected to be approximately 20.5%. Our updated guidance represents blowing through just over 50 basis points of improved operating margin, predominantly driven by the better than expected gross margin experienced in the third quarter. This improved outlook for the fiscal year, which equates to $0.45 raise in our earnings per share on the high end of our guidance, is driven by $0.25 from a lower promotional environment, $.15 cents from the HOKA brand and $0.05 from an improved outlook on the margins in the fourth quarter. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges, as well as the effect of any future share repurchases. During our second quarter earnings call in October, we provided an annual update on our sheepskin pricing. Due to current events, I would like to remind everyone we expect no change to our sheepskin cost for fiscal 2021. As is our normal course of business, we have contract in place, which are used to mitigate the impact of volatility within such commodity prices. Again, please note that sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margin and this update does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year. With that, I'll now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Jon, this is Steve. As Dave said, I think what we saw was compelling product in the marketplace. We didn't have a nice setup so that definitely helped. Having clean marketplace also helped. So going into the quarter cleaner in the wholesale channel was a good setup for us. And then we did have a nice start into the quarter. So from what we implied in our guidance or what we have in our guidance, we did better on the promotion side that was largely driven in the domestic component of the business. We did have some promotions related to the international. But from what we were thinking would happen, we did 60 basis points to 80 basis points, probably a little bit better in the quarter than what we had thought related to the promotion. And then just a note on Q4, with kind of strong clean sell-through, we've increased our margin on Q4. So we removed some of that conservative promotional that we have factored into Q4. I'll take care of the channel inventory, still good. It's up a little bit from where we were a year ago, but comfortable with the levels really that we're seeing. And the feedback that we've gotten really good strong sell through in Q3. So I think we're -- we feel good about where the inventory fit coming out of the quarter. I think I'll take this one and Dave can jump in. I think one of the things that we have seen, especially as a lot of the work that we've done, we've taken as part of our profit improvement plan. We've taken a lot of expense out. As we're rebuilding brand heat, as we're moving into some of the new initiatives, we are investing in those initiatives and that's where you're seeing the increase in the current year, and it's delivering results. So we think the spend is appropriate this year, we'll give guidance on kind of how we're looking at next year. But we're investing more in marketing so we're increasing that variable component of our spend, and it's something that we're going to be able to watch closely. But it's an important part with the brands growing as rapidly as they are that we continue to feel that through marketing and investment. I'll take the first one. Our DTC comp was up 4.7%. As you know, we don't break out retail and e-com. But clearly e-com performed very strongly. I think retail for the most part was kind of within our expectations but down. And so you know it's something that we're constantly looking at. It's something that we talked about really for the last couple of years of how we're shaping our fleet and how we're improving performance. So something that we're going to continue to monitor, clearly, retail plays an important strategic element in how we go to market. And so that's going to be a continued area that we're going to look at. And it's something that we are working on and improving in some of the stores that have been underperforming. And for those that have underperformed, we've closed. So that's something that we'll continue to monitor and work as we progressed along. So I'll start with that and Dave can jump in. I think, as we said, we do have a factor in there, a little bit on more of the demand side. From a supply side, most of our product is coming out of Vietnam, so we haven't seen at this point any disruption from a supply side issue. As I said, we have put in an element around the demand related to China and restrictions in China. As I also said, it's still very early. So it's really hard to know where this is going to go and how it's going to end up. But at this point, with the majority of our supply coming out of Vietnam from a supply issue, we're in good shape but we'll see how things develop. DTC is all digital at this point. Yes, correct. On the HOKA breakout and we haven't given specific numbers. But from a dollar perspective, I think it's -- we're about two-thirds little less on domestic and one-third kind of international. Yes, I'm nothing to share there right now. We're continuing to evaluate opportunities for that long-term in all regions. And so, right now we're staying the course and building brand helping our subsidiary market, supporting the distributors. We have actually done that with our Canadian market. So this will be the first year in FY21 that is fully owned and run by us. We did that in Japan about three or four years ago, and it proved very successful. So it's something we're considering as we look at the long-term strategic outlook of this, and making sure that operationally we are ready to do that if we get to that point. Yes, normally we give that update but I can give you just a little bit of clarity. So we're covered into 2022 so we're fully covered for 2021 and we're comfortably covered for 2022, and we'll be able to provide more of an update. But the supply that we have locked in we feel comfortable with the position that we have really definitely over the next year and well into 2022. So total women's classics, you know we've been hovering in the last few years below 50%. We're now turning closer to 40%, just seen above 40%. So part of that is on purpose with how we're controlling distribution allocation of the women's classics franchise. And some of that is also bolstered by the fact that you are seeing success in men's in other areas, such as the Fluff Yeah, and that strategy's working. We have more progress that we need to make in the international markets. Those are still a little bit more heavily penetrated, some of the in the core classics. But as the adoption of the Neumel and the Fluff, you know the categories increased in those markets and we finished out the segmentation and allocation work, we hope to see the same results in those international markets and being less reliant overall. And then, Paul, the way we're thinking about the margin, it depends on a number of factors. But clearly, on the domestic business where we have opportunity for margin improvement is with migration of more customers online. And we have seen that happening and that's helping drive some upside on the margin. So as we've talked about before, as consumers are introduced to the brand through the wholesale channel, there is a migration online as they get further down into repeat purchases. So we're continuing to see that trend, probably a little bit stronger than what we earlier identified. And then to the question earlier that we got, as we look at international markets, the further opportunity there is how we capture sales, both from our own market in the wholesale distributor markets, conversion to online business. So a lot more opportunity to drive the higher margin business, but we're still growing the brand. So we're bringing customers in, it's about how we're bringing customers in through all channels. And as they further engage with the brand, our opportunity is how we engage with them online and drive that margin for them. Yes, what we've said specifically to that is one kind of in the current quarter what we factored in and still relatively small. In terms of international markets, we've said about half of that is Europe, 40-ish percent of that is APAC. And when you look at APAC, it's now kind of split between China and Japan largely. Right now, men's is tracking as we planned it. As you know, we've been talking about this for the last few years now and migrating men to younger, more fashion oriented consumer with different distribution away from the traditional slipper and classic business. We're now at about 15% of the total penetration. We think the potential there is closer to 20% over time. But it's really being driven by the Neumel franchise and some of the winter boots in that business. So the Neumel has continued to resonate, both their core distribution but also at new distribution like the Footlocker and Footaction, real strength in journeys. We've opened up some sport lifestyle distribution in the EMEA market, which is starting to perform well. It hasn't resonated to the same extent in Europe and Asia that it has in the U.S. yet, but it's an early days of introduction at that consumer. So we're leveraging the marketing playbook that has worked well in the U.S., which is collaborations and high level influencers and ambassadors for the brand, showing the product in a new and exciting way and we're going to continue down that path. At the same time, we're seeing success in derivatives of that, the Harkland boot which is little bit slimmer and more appropriate to an international consumer, leveraging the Butte franchise, which is our leading winter boot and then leveraging existing styles like the Tasman slipper, which is also being worn by younger high school, college age students. So we feel good about the reach of the consumer and the diversity of the product, and the teams are working very fast to iterate as much as we can and to take advantage of the opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier on, there is also opportunity we think in the Fluff franchise to translate that to the male consumer as well. So one thing we did this year is we've pulled forward our closet event. So last year, we had it in January. This year we pulled it into the last week of December. And we saw two things; one, we saw it perform but we saw it perform better than what we expected; and we did see a corresponding low to the start of January. So you know that was the case where we saw products selling stronger in that last week where we thought some of that might trickle really into the first part of January. And so capturing that sale late in December and the low, we put the timing as people were buying the product earlier."

For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue increased by 8% versus last year to $542 million. Gross margins came in above 50% and we delivered earnings per share of $2.71. These results are above the high end of our guidance range due to the outperformance in the HOKA ONE ONE brand as well as the strength seen through early shipments related to the UGG brands domestic business. During the second quarter, we continued to drive momentum in our key initiatives. As HOKA continued to experience explosive growth, UGG men\u2019s boots increased by high-teens percentages, UGG women\u2019s non-core expanded through the fluff franchise and our online performance was strong. The Deckers team is focused on the execution of these key initiatives and I believe our commitment to investing in marketing and innovation, have been central to the strength of our results. Our results also highlight the organization\u2019s focus and discipline to drive healthy top line growth while maintaining our top tier levels of profitability. I will now review the brand highlights from the quarter starting with the fashion lifestyle group. The fashion lifestyle group consists of the UGG and Koolaburra brands. For UGG, global sales in the second quarter were up 2% versus the prior year to $405 million driven by continued strength domestically with some offsets in our EMEA region. The health of our domestic business has been driven by a clean marketplace. Thanks to our allocation and segmentation strategy as well as targeted investments in digital marketing and PR. UGG brands interest in the U.S. is up 11% in the quarter versus last year according to Google trends. In particular, we have seen another 20% plus increase in customer acquisition within the key 18 to 34-year-old demographic. This targeted demographic increase has been driven by the powerful organic PR driven by the UGG brand, which include several high profile celebrities photographed wearing our product. From a product perspective, the Fluff Yeah Slide shows no signs of slowing down. The hybrid sandal slipper has been a steady acquisition vehicle for new consumers online in addition to continued momentum in the wholesale channel. The UGG team has built a thoughtful plan for lifecycle management aimed at optimizing the Fluff franchise\u2019s differentiated point of distribution. The women\u2019s non-core business is also experiencing early success with the newly launched Classic FM which is a fashion forward take on our iconic classic boots. The UGG design team has done a fantastic job of delivering compelling new products with strong tie to our heritage styling. I believe the Classic FM combined with new products featured in the recent launch of our women\u2019s classic revolution campaign go a long way in highlighting the depth of the UGG brand differentiated product offering. Due to these new product introductions and segmented distribution strategy, our women\u2019s business is experiencing increasing adoption from younger consumers. On the men\u2019s side, I am pleased with the early response to the Neumel nation marketing campaign, our largest ever men specific campaign which drove a double-digit increase in the number of male consumers to ugg.com with over half of them being new to the brands. For the campaign, we partnered with actor and fashion influencer, Luka Sabbat, who represents the UGG brand ethos of defying convention and changing culture. On the heels of Neumel nation, UGG released its second limited edition collaboration with fashion designer, Heron Preston. The collection featured two heritage styles, the Tasmin slipper and the Classic Mini with updated features and benefits. Both the new Neumel marketing campaigns and collaboration efforts are aimed at driving increased awareness and consideration from young male consumers. And I look forward to the results they will drive in our third quarter. On the international front, we are in the early stages of a multiyear plan to reset the marketplace in our EMEA region. As a reminder, the marketplace reset in Europe is similar to the strategy that we successfully implemented in the domestic wholesale marketplace over the past few years. This strategy is intended to clean up inventory in the marketplace, consolidate the account base to focus on partners who best represent the UGG brands and provide a more differentiated consumer experience. The end goal of this strategy aims to enhance the consumer experience with the UGG brand. We believe this strategy, has been key of our domestic success and as a result we are working to drive successful implementation in the EMEA region. The revenue headwind of these actions in addition to the impact of currency is in total estimated to be approximately $25 million to $30 million for the remainder of the fiscal year. Overall, I am encouraged by the progress of its making with a variety of consumer segments and look forward to continued strides in our holiday quarter as we launch our largest ever holiday campaign. The holiday campaign will celebrate the gift of UGG with the Los Angeles based Elis music family. Look out for that launch over the coming weeks. Turning to Koolaburra, global sales in the second quarter increased 41% versus the prior year to $26 million. Koolaburra growth was aligned with the brand strategy of gaining market share in the domestic wholesale family value channel. We are excited to be launching Koolaburra with a few new partners this season in conjunction with the increased demand experienced with our existing partners. The brand is also testing some category extensions this fall, which includes the launch of licensed home products with Kohl\u2019s. Having said that, our near-term focus for the brand remains on building compelling footwear targeted for the family value channel. At the close of the second quarter, I feel both UGG and Koolaburra are well positioned to capture holiday demand through segmented and differentiated product in their respective channels of distribution. Shifting to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA ONE ONE, Teva and Sanuk, HOKA continues to exceed expectations. For the second quarter, HOKA global sales increased by 50% to $78 million. Similar to the first quarter, the HOKA brand\u2019s growth is well balanced with strength domestically, internationally and across both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. From a product perspective, the HOKA brand experienced success in both its core franchises as well as with new product introductions. On the franchise front, Clifton and Bondi continued to experience significant growth year-over-year. In the meantime, HOKA is also finding success with new styles such as the Carbon X and Rincon which are bringing new consumers to the brand. The HOKA evolution is best evidenced by recently becoming the number two brand in terms of run specialty market share for the month of August according to NPD. The Rincon was released in July with the target to acquire high school and college based athletes. This innovative new silhouette was designed with the lightweight cushion expected in the typical HOKA shoe, but a more accessible price point. The coordinated Rincon marketing campaign was highly successful in the quarter with 50% of online consumers being new to the brand and nearly 40% of those consumers represented in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic. In terms of new product launches for the spring 2019 season, I am happy to announce that every single new product, HOKA launched won an award. These accolades range from the Rincon winning editor\u2019s choice by Runner\u2019s World to the Carbon X winning Gear of the Year from Outside Magazine. This recognition is a direct result of developing innovative high performance product and combining it with the right marketing and distribution. Congrats to everyone involved in this impressive achievement. This is yet another indication of the strength of our product and innovation engine at Deckers. Shifting to Teva global sales in the second quarter increased by 7% to $23 million. The universal and hurricane franchises continued to drive brand momentum so much so that Teva was able to regain the title of number one in market share within the sports sandal category for the spring 2019 season according to NPD. The brand had an impressive spring season both in terms of revenue performance and brand heat. Teva was featured in the New York Times as well as an article in Vogue that gave Teva the honor of being called shoe of summer. Congrats to the Teva team on a great spring season. Looking to fall, we are encouraged to see the Ember franchise and corresponding marketing campaign has continued to be an acquisition vehicle for the brand, driving a nearly 50% increase in search interest according to Google trends. Global sales in the second quarter were $11 million. Most of the decline versus last year is attributable to the weakness in the Yoga Sling franchise. As noted during our Q1 earnings call, we have made the strategic decision to exit the warehouse channel to focus on healthier full price channels. We expect sales volumes will continue to decline for the balance of FY \u201820 but remain focused on exploring healthier avenues for brand distribution as we work to reposition it in the marketplace. All of Deckers Brands and marketing teams are making great strides on building compelling product with targeted and diverse consumers in mind in conjunction with a strategic global marketing plan that enabled increased investments. Our brand, strong PR in addition to focus digital marketing efforts would drive first half performance and I look forward to additional progress in that front. Moving to channel performance in the second quarter. Global wholesale increased by 9% versus the prior year driven primarily by domestic expansion in UGG, HOKA and Koolaburra as well as international expansion of HOKA and Teva. Gains in HOKA and Teva internationally have mostly been driven by the strength of our Asia-Pacific region. In aggregate, international wholesale was slightly down versus the prior year due to the UGG reset in EMEA as well as negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. From a direct consumer perspective, comparable sales increased 7% versus the prior year with total DTC sales up 5% versus the second quarter last year. E-commerce continues to drive gains in the DTC channel which has been led by the strength of UGG and HOKA. The HOKA brands gains in DTC are shifting the channel mix dynamics for the brand which is leading to an improved gross margin profile. While largely sale in quarter, our second quarter performance was solid but the Deckers team remains focused on delivering our largest third quarter ever. I\u2019m confident that with the recent momentum of the business, we are well positioned for the back half of the year. I will now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance as well as outlook for the third quarter in our full fiscal year. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave just mentioned, we have tremendous momentum in the business and have delivered a record second quarter. This quarter is yet another example of the progress we have made in growing our brands while at the same time, delivering improved levels of profitability. And now I will walk you through some of the elements of the quarter. Revenue was $542 million, up 8% versus last year and above the high end of our guidance range of $515 million to $525 million of the better than expected performance approximately $10 million was driven by the HOKA brand with exceptional results both in wholesale and direct to consumer channels with the balance of the be driven by earlier domestic wholesale shipments for the UGG brand. Overall, gross margins were up 20 basis points over last year to 50.4% this result was an improvement of our implied guidance with the main drivers of the variance to expectation coming from savings from the utilization of less expensive freight options, an improvement from higher gross margin rates on closeout sales and the favorable mix with the HOKA brand increasing its penetration to the total company beyond what we had anticipated, including incremental growth in e-commerce. These partially offset by channel mix as wholesale grew faster than DTC. In terms of SG&A expense, our dollar spend was up 8.9% to $175.9 compared to last year\u2019s GAAP spend of $161.5 million and up 9.1%, compared to last year\u2019s non-GAAP spend of $161.2 million. Spend was aligned with how we guided the quarter. This increase versus last year was driven primarily by incremental marketing investments that have been put in place to drive awareness around the HOKA brand, UGG men\u2019s product as well as the extended UGG women\u2019s offerings. This all resulted in earnings per share of $2.71 compared to last year\u2019s GAAP earnings per share of $2.48, last year\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.38 and the high end of our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.25. The $0.46 beat to the high end of our guidance came from $0.15 of increased HOKA performance, $0.15 of favorable gross margins including savings in freight and a higher margin rate achieved on closeout sales, $0.10 from earlier domestic wholesale shipments from the UGG brand, $0.03 from reduced share count related to the repurchase of shares in the second quarter and $0.03 from a lower tax rate for the second quarter due to timing of discrete tax entries, partially offset by the reduced interest income. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of the company\u2019s common stock at an average price of $145.31 for a total of 155 million. As of September 30th, 2019, $160 million remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet at September 30th remains strong as cash and equivalence were $178 million down 2% from $182 million at September 30th of last year which includes repurchasing $155 million worth of shares during the second quarter. Inventory was up 8.5% to $559 million from $515 million at the same time last year. And we had 14 million in short-term borrowings under our credit line as compared to $71 million last year. Before moving on to our updated guidance, I\u2019d like to reiterate the performance achieved in the first half of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first half of last year. Our portfolio of brands delivered $819 million in revenue, representing a 9% increase versus prior year driven by a disciplined approach to driving our key initiatives. Strong gross margins of 49.2% were achieved an increase of 46 basis points and even with the strategic reinvestment we experienced SG&A leverage with operating expense decreasing as a percentage of revenue. All of this, leading to a 27% increase in operating income for the first half of the year and then nearly 50% increase in earnings per share versus the first half of last year. Now moving on to our outlook, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $900 million which anticipates growth in the range of 1% to 3% this is on top of the strong increase that we experienced in the third quarter of last year. To provide some additional color on the brand elements, we expect UGG to be roughly flat as the domestic strength will be largely offset by international pressures. Strong growth with both the HOKA and Koolaburra brands, a year-over-year decline in the Teva EMEA business which will be offset with growth in Q4 due to the timing of the distributor orders, and lower sales in Sanuk, with this resulting in earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.40. Within our third quarter guidance, we expect global wholesale reorders for the UGG brand to equal cancellations and we are expecting an increase of promotional activity as compared to the prior two years. For fiscal year 2020, we are updating our financial guidance. We are increasing sales from our prior range of $2.1 billion to $2.125 billion to now be in the range of $2.115 billion to $2.14 billion an increase of $15 million. This increase in guidance reflects the strength and the momentum that we continue to see in the HOKA brand with the raise related to the second quarter performance as well as a lift on the balance of the year for the brand. Our expectations for the HOKA have continued to climb, well beyond our original outlook for the year. But it is important to keep in mind that with this increase our near-term ability to chase further incremental revenue for HOKA is limited due to timing of inbound inventory. As we have pivoted into the peak selling season for the UGG brand, our full year outlook for UGG remains consistent with our original guidance for fiscal 2020, at flat to low single-digit revenue growth. As previously mentioned our outlook assumes a higher level of promotional activity as compared to last year and remains unchanged for the back half of the year. To summarize our updated outlook for the full year at a brand level is as follows. UGG revenue expectations remain flat to up low-single digits. HOKA is now expected to be up in the mid to high 40% range, Teva is still expected to be approximately flat inclusive of the EMEA distributor channel shift, Sanuk is expected to be down in the 30% range and Koolaburra is still expected to grow in the mid 50% range. Turning to the remainder of the P&L, gross margins are expected to be approximately 50.8% SG&A as a percent of sales are anticipated to be slightly lower than 36%, operating margins are now expected to be approximately 15% and we are raising our expected earnings per share to be in the range of $8.90 to $9.05 on a newly updated share count of approximately 28.7 million shares with a full year tax rate of 20.5%. The roughly $0.45 raise in earnings per share is being driven by increases of $0.20 from higher HOKA brand sales including the second quarter beat and raised expectations for the back half of the year, $0.20 related to the second quarter share repurchase and $0.15 from favorable second quarter gross margins. These partially offset by $0.10 of additional expense added in the second half as we continue to shift our expense profile from fixed to variable spend allowing us to reinvest in our key initiatives and support our increased full year revenue outlook. Our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges as well as the effect of any future share repurchase. Additionally, we believe that we have been able to mitigate any material impact from tariffs in the current fiscal year 2020. On that topic we are continuing to assess the impact of tariff policy decisions going forward. As there still a lot of factors to work through, we are not yet providing an estimate on the impact beyond fiscal year 2020. We are evaluating options that can potentially offset these increased costs including considerations of pricing power within our brands as well as continuing conversations with our suppliers who are willing to work with us. As a reminder, we have stated that less than 20% of our current global production is created in China and shipped to the United States. During this period, we also provide an update on our sheepskin pricing. We continue to see stable prices in the sheepskin market and we expect no change in the sheepskin costs for fiscal 2021. This does not constitute our gross margin guidance for next year as our sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margins. With our strong first half results behind us, we remain confident in delivering the expectations outlined for the balance of the fiscal year. Our full year guidance implies second half revenue growth of 2% to 4% versus last year. This is on top of the 5% growth achieved in the second half of fiscal 2019. To summarize our full year guidance, we are now projecting top line growth in the range of 5% to 6% with the intention of delivering a 15% operating margin. To achieve this, the Deckers organization is focused on executing our strategies in the upcoming peak holiday season. And while there is work ahead of us, I would like to thank the team for their continued dedication and energy put into our brands every day. With that, I will now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thank you, Steve. As I look back in the first half of this year, I am encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made on our key initiatives. This includes investing in marketing to drive brand heat and awareness in HOKA UGG Men\u2019s and UGG Women\u2019s non-core, building our technology tools and talent base to advance analytical capabilities and drive efficiencies and how we connect with consumers, both existing and acquired and using innovation to develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio. I would like to thank all of the Deckers employees across the globe for their continued devotion to delivering strong results through the execution of our strategies. But before I turn the call over to Q&A as you may have seen in our earnings press release earlier this afternoon, Mike Devine has been appointed to the role of Chairman of the Board. Mike has been on the Board for the past eight years and assumes the role from John Gibbons. I look forward to working with Mike in this capacity. John will remain on the Board and I would like to thank him for his leadership as Chairman. The past few years have been transformational for Deckers and John has been a great partner in this journey. Jones\u2019 insight and expertise has been instrumental in our progress and I am extremely grateful for his contributions to the Deckers organization. And as always, I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I am excited about the opportunities in front of us and the direction our organization is headed. With that, we will now open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Jonathan Komp of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Thank you. I want to maybe start with the UGG brand and I am curious to hear a little more color, what you are seeing in the marketplace, I know you called out some earlier deliveries. I\u2019m curious, maybe what drove that. And then as you look to the third quarter, just given how favorable conditions were last year. Any updated thoughts on what you expect over the next few months as cycle some of that favorability?\nDave Powers: Jon, this is Dave. The early deliveries were just opportunistic. Couple of our accounts were open to receiving some inventory a little bit earlier and we took advantage of that. But the setup for the quarter looks good. As you know, we\u2019ve been working particularly in North America to really clean up the channel going into the season, coming out of a strong last year the inventory is very clean the accounts are set up. We\u2019ve had a little bit of a warm start in the season but the sell-throughs are still going to wholesale and I think we are poised with the diversification efforts in the segmentation and allocation plans for a good quarter. Obviously, as you heard there some softness still in the European market. A lot of that is by design with the segmentation and allocation strategy in the market reset coming out of the UK there but still some macro headwinds with Brexit going on in the malaise of the UK consumer, but all in all, I think the way that we have been focusing on a younger consumer, diversifying the product offering, managing the marketplace very tightly, working with our key wholesale partners and going into the back half of the year with increased marketing investment, we feel we\u2019re in a solid position.\nSteve Fasching: This is Steve. Jon, just to add on that as we look at the UGG domestic wholesale business, it\u2019s good channel for us. It is relatively clean which is why our customers want product and we have an ability to ship on products, so we\u2019ll take advantage of that. As Dave said, international will be down as we reset Europe but other than that all the signs are good at this point and the product is resonating.\nDave Powers: We are hearing of some softness in the channel at a macro level. Obviously there is some news out there about top line softness and some of the wholesale partners managing tightly with their inventory. But as far as our brands that are particularly with UGG, Koolaburra and HOKA. We\u2019re still seeing healthy demand and good positioning.\nJonathan Komp: That\u2019s encouraging to hear. Maybe one on HOKA then just given that when I look over, even though the trailing 12 month basis, I think you\u2019ve added about $100 million of revenue to the brand which is quite impressive. I\u2019m just wondering as you breaking through to the next phase of growth, any updated thoughts on the team and the infrastructure and kind of the level of investment in place to support the growth, maybe longer term as some of the inventory constraints to become less so?\nSteve Fasching: I think one of the beauties of Deckers and platform that we\u2019ve been working on over the last few years to really improve our capabilities across the board is to be able to support the growth in the hyper growth of the HOKA brand and obviously with the margin profile of that brand, the efficiencies we\u2019ve created across the organization, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to invest not only just in marketing dollar but innovation design, sourcing of that brand and for the distribution globally. So it\u2019s exceeding our expectations. We\u2019re in a little bit of chase mode on inventory, but we\u2019re in good shape to be able to capture as a demand at this point. We are planning for continued strong growth in that brand. And so you\u2019ll see as we guide the beginning going into FY \u201821 continued investment to be able to continue the growth of that brand and it\u2019s really a global opportunity. As you know, North America wholesale and DTC is very strong for that brand, but we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth still in Europe, Japan and we haven\u2019t really started going after China yet. So very pleased very excited with the acceptance and the demand coming from the consumer. The innovation pipeline is still strong and the signs that will be coming out in the next 6 to 12 months we feel we\u2019ll continue that momentum and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in it.\nDave Powers: And great international opportunity.\nSteve Fasching: Yes.\nDave Powers: Continuing to see kind of that brand resonate on an international front and a lot more opportunity on that international front.\nJonathan Komp: Great. And maybe just last one if I could maybe a bigger picture for the organization, Steve or Dave, you are planning this to be the third year of mid single-digit top line growth and you\u2019ve reset the operating margin back to 15% here, just any broader thoughts on you kind of the growth trajectory going forward for the company and any sort of kind of algorithm even at a high level to think about as a sustainable level?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. We worked hard to get to this point and I give the teams a lot of credit for their discipline while at the same time, we\u2019re really building strong healthy brands across our global marketplace and I think for us, there\u2019s no looking back we\u2019re continuing down this path. We think that we have some very meaningful and important brands for the consumer and our wholesale partners and we believe that we can continue this level of growth in mid-single digits and then 15% operating margin for the foreseeable future for sure.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks. Jon thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple of questions from me. The first I wanted to ask about the purposeful turn in the European business. Dave, can you give us some milepost to look for your progress with that. I know you\u2019ve been through this before in the U.S. market. When do you expect to come out the other side with the European business?\nDave Powers: As we said before, it\u2019s a multi-year strategy and we do have proof of concept with the strategy in North America, which took us 2 to 3 years to really get to the real strength of where we are now. So I would expect the same in Europe. This is really the first time that we have been pulling back on inventory with the allocation strategy and reducing the amount off price sales, part of what you\u2019re seeing in the takedown of the projection this year is the decision to not chase off price sales we\u2019re more focused on creating a healthy and long-term position for the UGG brand versus chasing a revenue number and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. The teams have been working very hard on the allocation strategy there and making sure that each account is differentiated point of view and going after the right consumer with the appropriate product. My sense is, we\u2019ll come out at the end of this year in a much better inventory position and cleaner marketplace and then we can really start the reset going into FY \u201821 footfall \u201820.\nJim Duffy: Great. And Dave wanted to ask about the HOKA brand, you have had some good success with non-performance running styles, the hiking boot, Opana shoes, can you talk a little bit about opportunities you see beyond just the performance running category for the HOKA brand?\nDave Powers: The first thing I would say is all of the product is performance-based and they\u2019re all built for running as our core and running in hiking obviously is our core target. That being said, a lot of our styles are being adopted by a non-runner consumer both on the fashion side as you see some of the HOKA brand and kind of the top fashion boutiques across the globe which is very exciting. But I think more importantly the average consumer from an athletic standpoint people are wearing HOKA, starting to run again or from our casual lifestyle perspective but the performance attributes of that ultra lightweight cushioned performance in that ride resonates with the casual consumer as well. And so I think you\u2019re starting to see a lot more consumers adopt it because they just love how it feels and hopefully some of those consumers are also getting back into running again at the same time.\nJim Duffy: Great, thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Could you give us the breakdown of where the where this expected incremental promotional activity is supposed to come from? Because I believe in Europe you have promotional last year. So can you just walk through that expectation, I guess both in Q3 and Q4?\nSteve Fasching: Sam, so we\u2019re expecting in our guidance increased level of promotion over last year. We think that will be wholesale with some of the retailers that we\u2019re working with so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve embedded. We\u2019ll see how it plays out, right? The biggest part of our season is still ahead of us. We\u2019ll see how the consumer shows up. Early signs are good sell through, clear inventory. So it\u2019s a kind of a wait and see and we\u2019ll see kind of what happens but where it\u2019s mostly factored is kind of in wholesale with a little bit that you\u2019ll see in our DTC business.\nDave Powers: Yes. And as you said Sam, we\u2019re not expecting to play into that to need to do that in the European business but we do have the ability to do that if necessary in North America wholesale and I think as we have discussed on the last call, if there is upside to the seasons is probably more on the margin side than the sales right.\nSam Poser: And could you give us some idea of what you expect the gross margin to be in the third quarter?\nDave Powers: So we\u2019re kind of implied in our guidance, it\u2019s roughly down about 90 basis points from last year.\nSam Poser: Got it. And then and then also are there expenses, I know you\u2019re switching this variable model, but are there expenses looking ahead that you sort of expect to fall away next year given some of the work you\u2019re doing in the international markets that should some of that probably money do maybe close more stores and so on so forth. Can you give us some idea there sort of just look at ahead?\nSteve Fasching: We haven\u2019t given anything out on \u201821. It\u2019s something clearly that we\u2019ll look at, I wouldn\u2019t right now factor in kind of anything from a significant expense reduction, a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing is kind of with the infrastructure that we have. So once we get back to growth, we will need infrastructure to support that growth. So there will be able to kind of use our existing infrastructure to lever growth as we return to growth on the International. So from that standpoint again, we haven\u2019t given guidance on next year but I wouldn\u2019t expect a significant fall off. I think to the earlier question about how we look at our P&L profile looking at a 15% operating margin we\u2019re going to spend appropriately as we have now seen a lot of our gross margin efforts come through and then the shift to variable that we\u2019re talking about is really about how we invest more in marketing to drive the initiatives to build brand awareness around the things that we\u2019re doing so building awareness with HOKA, building awareness with men with UGG building awareness with spring-summer women\u2019s UGG as well. And when we look at that is still a lot of opportunity.\nSam Poser: Thank you. I have two last questions. One, what tax rate do you expect for the third quarter? And lastly, could you give us the direct or the wholesale sales by brand so we don\u2019t have to wait for the queue. So it\u2019s easier to model everything going forward, please. Thank you.\nDave Powers: So the tax rate for Q3, we haven\u2019t given that but there is going to be some fluctuations between Q3 and Q4 but roughly, we\u2019re kind of modeling it like 21%-ish rate for Q3. And then I think your second question was just be \u2013 sorry, it was the wholesale breakout for UGG in Q2?\nSam Poser: For the wholesale for the DTC breakout by brand for the second quarter that comes out in the queue, but it really would help us model everything, if you could give us one or the other and we can back into the other one.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I can take that. So you want it in total wholesale?\nSam Poser: No, like UGG wholesale is this Teva wholesale was this, Sanuk sale was this and so on.\nDave Powers: Sure. Got it. So of the 542, 332 was UGG brand wholesale, roughly 51 million was HOKA brand wholesale, Teva with 17, Sanuk was 8 and Koolaburra was around 25.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Continue success.\nDave Powers: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Ross Licero with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nRoss Licero: Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. Just had a question, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about sustainability in the market right now, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing for that and how your messaging it to the customer?\nSteve Fasching: That\u2019s it\u2019s a great question and I think if have been our Deckers website. I\u2019ll start there, couple of years ago we put out some sustainability goals we call 7 x 27 that have guided a lot of the activities around sustainability for Deckers but also each of our brands and over the last 3 to 6 months each of the brands is doing individual work to improve the way they operate across the planet, both in product and kind of operational periods as well. I can\u2019t get into all the specifics that are happening right now but there is work being done and you\u2019re going to see some more conversations happening in the marketplace with each of our brands around efforts they are making, but it\u2019s probably best at a brand level versus the Deckers level to focus into that because there is unique approaches to this space based on the brand positioning and the relevancy in that marketplace and for the consumer, But I am excited to say that is something that Deckers as an organization is taking seriously. We are standing behind it with our global 7/27 goals and within each of the brand and the work that they\u2019re doing and I think you will see some continued evolution in the product that we\u2019re bringing to market on the short term.\nRoss Licero: Okay, great. Thanks. And on the men\u2019s side, you said the Men\u2019s boots were up double digits. But can we get a little more color on men\u2019s overall?\nDave Powers: Men\u2019s overall UGG for Q2?\nRoss Licero: Yes.\nDave Powers: So other than just men\u2019s is growing faster than the average overall so men\u2019s is up more than the average.\nRoss Licero: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nDave Powers: It\u2019s really focused on Q3. If you\u2019ve seen our Neumel we kind of Neumel nation marketing campaign their efforts in the script very great, very positive response to that campaign. As we said that\u2019s driving interest of the brand and traffi, but the product is really a Q3 products, you should see the bigger impact of that business happening over the next couple of months, focused on the Neumel and winter boots.\nRoss Licero: great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks guys. Can you talk about gross margin trends by channel? What was the most channels with the driver of the improvement this quarter when you look at each channel relative to itself. Also curious if you\u2019ve seen a lot of fluctuations or inconsistency with the inconsistent weather out there and I guess I\u2019m kind of curious how you would look at, what percent of your assortment, would you consider weather-dependent this year versus what percentage it was last year? Thanks guys.\nDave Powers: Yes, let me walk you a little bit, maybe just through the margin walk rather than kind of breaking it out. So a year ago we were at 50.2, this year we\u2019re at the 50.4, so 20 basis point improvement, about 50 basis points of improvement through margin expansion. So that\u2019s just achieving better margin on product as we continue to work on those efforts. We had, as I mentioned, part of the driver of the increase in our margin was really kind of better full price selling so less promotion better margins on our close out that was about 80 basis points. And then we have a take away really from FX about 70 basis points. The channel mix, because we had more wholesale growth that was about a 20 basis take away. And then kind of miscellaneous other stuff, roughly 20 basis point. So that\u2019s kind of the lock on the year-on-year.\nPaul Lejuez: Yes and with the before price selling benefit in both channels there? Were you referring to both channels there?\nDave Powers: Yes, I mean you could where we\u2019re doing closeout out. So where we have reduced selling online was better as well as some of our traditional closeout through.\nSteve Fasching: And with regards to the weather question, for the UGG brand generally speaking, the whole brand is somewhat weather-dependent with the exception of probably slippers but what we\u2019ve been doing over the last few years is to reduce our dependency on cold weather-related products. So for example we have reduced the reliance on core classic, we brought a lot more fashion boots into the assortment across men\u2019s and women\u2019s. I think some of the diversified product that you\u2019ve seen toward the younger consumer is a less weather-dependent diversifying into men\u2019s is less reliant on the core classic business. So we\u2019re used to be kind of a one-trick pony, which is at the core classic across all the channels, the diversification efforts, fashion ability of the brand, the diversification across new consumers has given us more fashion relevance and less weather-dependentcy across the board and I think that served well last year and it\u2019s only stronger this year and it gives us something that\u2019s going to continue to evolve. So it\u2019s less certainly we\u2019re still dependent on the weather just like everybody else\u2019s but I think we\u2019re much more fashion relevant to the consumer now that is looking for product from just beyond kind of cold weather product.\nPaul Lejuez: So have you actually seen more consistency in the business, even though the weather has been inconsistent as a result of those strategies?\nSteve Fasching: I would say so.\nDave Powers: I would say we\u2019ve seen improvements in other weather-dependent categories. Absolutely.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Quick one on the gross margins, I think you said Q3 should be down 90-ish basis points which would mean that Q4 would be down quite a bit. Basically double that amount in basis points, is that just a function of the hard multi-year compares is it tariffs, any sort of color around that would be helpful.\nDave Powers: Sure. So you are right Tom. You\u2019ve kind of got the numbers right. That is how we\u2019re looking at the back half of the year. It\u2019s a combination of the things that you mentioned. The big point will be the comparison that we have to last year. So we are assuming a higher promotional back half than what we saw last year. As you recall, last year was a pretty exceptional back half of the year, as we saw sell-through at full price incredibly strong, so not what we normally see which is kind of why we\u2019re taking a slightly more conservative approach as we look at the back half of this year but that will be the biggest component of the take-back, we\u2019ll see how the season plays out but we do have higher promotional environment factored into the back half. And then there is always a component of FX in there and then you\u2019ll have some impact potential with the tariff piece. So that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at it and we\u2019ll see how it plays out in terms of what the margin is, but you are right. And the biggest component of that will be our assumption around a more promotional environment than what we saw last year in the back half.\nTom Nikic: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just a longer term picture about HOKA, I think obviously it\u2019s one of the more interesting, a long-term growth stories in the footwear space, based on your guidance this year, it\u2019s going to get to something in the $300 million to $350 million range, Is there any sort of multi-year target, you can give some sort of potential revenue base for the brand that you could see in the next couple of years?\nDave Powers: This is Dave. We are not ready prepared to give that kind of guidance right now. I will say that we do think this has significant upside and the strength of the brand you\u2019re seeing now, we see that continuing going into FY \u201821 and beyond our sights are set above over the next 2 to 3 years, 500 million and beyond.\nTom Nikic: Got it. And just a quick another one on HOKA, I know you\u2019re still early stages international there. Could you give us some sort of sense as to what the domestic versus international split is for the HOKA brand?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, it\u2019s still about two-third domestic, one-third international.\nTom Nikic: Alright. Thanks very much.\nDave Powers: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Janine Stichter of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on the gross margin, I think you called out less expensive freight is a driver as well, I just trying to understand what\u2019s going on there. I think last year it was a driver of gross margin that you didn\u2019t expect it to continue. And then I think you\u2019d called out planning to use more expensive freight in the second quarter this year. So is there anything structural going on there with how you\u2019re looking at freight and how should we think about that continuing?\nSteve Fasching: I think the way we are looking at freight historically up to last year we used more air freight. I think we\u2019ve gotten better at bringing product in, so that\u2019s help alleviate some of that need to bring in air freight. We have used a little bit more this year than we did last year as we\u2019re bringing inventory in where we see spikes in demand largely like HOKA. So I think we are demonstrated by our margin improvement, we are better at how we\u2019re bringing product and we\u2019ve been working with our factories doing better job level loading them, that\u2019s helping us bring inventory in. It\u2019s also helping us schedule a little bit better. It is also showing up as we bring inventory in a little bit earlier as well. So I think through a lot of the efforts and the margin improvements that we\u2019re achieving, we\u2019re kind of seeing that pay off. So, we\u2019ll always use some air freight. We didn\u2019t use quite as much as what we had anticipated in our guidance in Q2. We did use some but not nearly to the extent that we thought we would and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to look at. So, to your question things have changed and improved. I think we\u2019re doing a slightly better job but there will always be cases where you\u2019re going to have to use some of it, especially when you have kind of hot product and a brand that\u2019s in demand like HOKA. General cost of freight overall is not coming down.\nJanine Stichter: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just one question on the fluff franchise, it sounds like that\u2019s still growing nicely and a more than a year and now, can you talk about where that growth is coming from. Is it new accounts, is it deeper penetration in the accounts already in, and then how are you seeing the customer you acquire from that franchise as she buying other booth there how are you seeing her migrate outside of the Fluff in the fuzz?\nDave Powers: It\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really excited about on a number of fronts. First is we are attracting a younger consumer and a large portion of that consumer is first-time purchases to our website. So it\u2019s serving as a vehicle for acquisition as well as driving the business for us in the short and long term. So we\u2019re going to continue the diversification efforts still using key partners in those use accounts to reach that consumer but it really is across the board where it\u2019s worth performing at least in North America, that style isn\u2019t resonating as well in places like China and outside of the UK just yet but the demand for that product going into the back half of the year and into next year is very strong and we think this is a franchise that we can build on through continued diversification efforts and design and marketing and distribution efforts for quite some time.\nJanine Stichter: Great. Thank you very much.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Mitch Kummetz of Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.\nMitch Kummetz: Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, I was hoping you could reconcile a couple of pieces of the guidance for me, I think you said for Q3 UGG\u2019s flat but I think you said that U.S. would be up and then I know you also said that UGG reorders equal cancellation. So I know last year that was a net positive, including the US. So I\u2019m trying to understand how if the reorder or cancellations side of its worse but domestic I still is the difference that you expect DTC to grow a lot or that the order book going into Q3 is a lot stronger than a year ago. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you get there.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. The piece, I think that you might be missing is the UGG international wholesale is down and that\u2019s driven by the reset that we\u2019re talking about in Europe as well as a currency impact on our international business.\nMitch Kummetz: I get the international, I mean, specific to the U.S. because you expect U.S. to be up, but I would think that in the U.S. the reorder cancellation piece you\u2019re expecting worse than a year ago. So it seems like the difference with NBTC or the order book and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 we are up, it\u2019s a small number.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. And then also for Q3 you\u2019re saying gross margin now down 90 bps, I know you\u2019re expecting more promotions this year than last, can you say how much of the down 90 is specific to the promotions. I mean is it like down 100 or down 200 in the promotions and there is puts and takes elsewhere that gets you to 90, just trying to understand how much your, yes?\nSteve Fasching: You nailed it. So the promotion is down more than the total because we have some positive offsets.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. And then I guess maybe just one last one since I am last in the queue, when you\u2019re given the numbers to Sam, it plays in my model and it looks like UGG DTC was down roughly 5% in the quarter, is that just all about the reduction in store comp? Is there any way you can speak to kind of at the comp performance of UGG, DTC was that up in the quarter?\nSteve Fasching: So DTC on the 542 was, call it $99 million. A year ago we did just under $94 million. So the total DTC was up, now that will be all brands.\nMitch Kummetz: And a lot of that was HOKA. I mean HOKA e-commerce was up huge. I think Hoka DTC it looks like just by the numbers you gave was up like 100% I was trying to understand what the UGG DTC did in the quarter, if you get that specific, maybe not?\nSteve Fasching: You will see it on the queue when it comes out, but the UGG DTC was down and the down will be some fewer retails as well as more challenge in retail.\nMitch Kummetz: Okay. Alright. Thanks for your help. Good luck.\nSteve Fasching: Okay.\nOperator: This does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Deckers team has delivered yet another strong quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue increased by 8% versus last year to $542 million. Gross margins came in above 50% and we delivered earnings per share of $2.71. These results are above the high end of our guidance range due to the outperformance in the HOKA ONE ONE brand as well as the strength seen through early shipments related to the UGG brands domestic business. During the second quarter, we continued to drive momentum in our key initiatives. As HOKA continued to experience explosive growth, UGG men's boots increased by high-teens percentages, UGG women's non-core expanded through the fluff franchise and our online performance was strong. The Deckers team is focused on the execution of these key initiatives and I believe our commitment to investing in marketing and innovation, have been central to the strength of our results. Our results also highlight the organization's focus and discipline to drive healthy top line growth while maintaining our top tier levels of profitability. I will now review the brand highlights from the quarter starting with the fashion lifestyle group. The fashion lifestyle group consists of the UGG and Koolaburra brands. For UGG, global sales in the second quarter were up 2% versus the prior year to $405 million driven by continued strength domestically with some offsets in our EMEA region. The health of our domestic business has been driven by a clean marketplace. Thanks to our allocation and segmentation strategy as well as targeted investments in digital marketing and PR. UGG brands interest in the U.S. is up 11% in the quarter versus last year according to Google trends. In particular, we have seen another 20% plus increase in customer acquisition within the key 18 to 34-year-old demographic. This targeted demographic increase has been driven by the powerful organic PR driven by the UGG brand, which include several high profile celebrities photographed wearing our product. From a product perspective, the Fluff Yeah Slide shows no signs of slowing down. The hybrid sandal slipper has been a steady acquisition vehicle for new consumers online in addition to continued momentum in the wholesale channel. The UGG team has built a thoughtful plan for lifecycle management aimed at optimizing the Fluff franchise's differentiated point of distribution. The women's non-core business is also experiencing early success with the newly launched Classic FM which is a fashion forward take on our iconic classic boots. The UGG design team has done a fantastic job of delivering compelling new products with strong tie to our heritage styling. I believe the Classic FM combined with new products featured in the recent launch of our women's classic revolution campaign go a long way in highlighting the depth of the UGG brand differentiated product offering. Due to these new product introductions and segmented distribution strategy, our women's business is experiencing increasing adoption from younger consumers. On the men's side, I am pleased with the early response to the Neumel nation marketing campaign, our largest ever men specific campaign which drove a double-digit increase in the number of male consumers to ugg.com with over half of them being new to the brands. For the campaign, we partnered with actor and fashion influencer, Luka Sabbat, who represents the UGG brand ethos of defying convention and changing culture. On the heels of Neumel nation, UGG released its second limited edition collaboration with fashion designer, Heron Preston. The collection featured two heritage styles, the Tasmin slipper and the Classic Mini with updated features and benefits. Both the new Neumel marketing campaigns and collaboration efforts are aimed at driving increased awareness and consideration from young male consumers. And I look forward to the results they will drive in our third quarter. On the international front, we are in the early stages of a multiyear plan to reset the marketplace in our EMEA region. As a reminder, the marketplace reset in Europe is similar to the strategy that we successfully implemented in the domestic wholesale marketplace over the past few years. This strategy is intended to clean up inventory in the marketplace, consolidate the account base to focus on partners who best represent the UGG brands and provide a more differentiated consumer experience. The end goal of this strategy aims to enhance the consumer experience with the UGG brand. We believe this strategy, has been key of our domestic success and as a result we are working to drive successful implementation in the EMEA region. The revenue headwind of these actions in addition to the impact of currency is in total estimated to be approximately $25 million to $30 million for the remainder of the fiscal year. Overall, I am encouraged by the progress of its making with a variety of consumer segments and look forward to continued strides in our holiday quarter as we launch our largest ever holiday campaign. The holiday campaign will celebrate the gift of UGG with the Los Angeles based Elis music family. Look out for that launch over the coming weeks. Turning to Koolaburra, global sales in the second quarter increased 41% versus the prior year to $26 million. Koolaburra growth was aligned with the brand strategy of gaining market share in the domestic wholesale family value channel. We are excited to be launching Koolaburra with a few new partners this season in conjunction with the increased demand experienced with our existing partners. The brand is also testing some category extensions this fall, which includes the launch of licensed home products with Kohl's. Having said that, our near-term focus for the brand remains on building compelling footwear targeted for the family value channel. At the close of the second quarter, I feel both UGG and Koolaburra are well positioned to capture holiday demand through segmented and differentiated product in their respective channels of distribution. Shifting to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA ONE ONE, Teva and Sanuk, HOKA continues to exceed expectations. For the second quarter, HOKA global sales increased by 50% to $78 million. Similar to the first quarter, the HOKA brand's growth is well balanced with strength domestically, internationally and across both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. From a product perspective, the HOKA brand experienced success in both its core franchises as well as with new product introductions. On the franchise front, Clifton and Bondi continued to experience significant growth year-over-year. In the meantime, HOKA is also finding success with new styles such as the Carbon X and Rincon which are bringing new consumers to the brand. The HOKA evolution is best evidenced by recently becoming the number two brand in terms of run specialty market share for the month of August according to NPD. The Rincon was released in July with the target to acquire high school and college based athletes. This innovative new silhouette was designed with the lightweight cushion expected in the typical HOKA shoe, but a more accessible price point. The coordinated Rincon marketing campaign was highly successful in the quarter with 50% of online consumers being new to the brand and nearly 40% of those consumers represented in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic. In terms of new product launches for the spring 2019 season, I am happy to announce that every single new product, HOKA launched won an award. These accolades range from the Rincon winning editor's choice by Runner's World to the Carbon X winning Gear of the Year from Outside Magazine. This recognition is a direct result of developing innovative high performance product and combining it with the right marketing and distribution. Congrats to everyone involved in this impressive achievement. This is yet another indication of the strength of our product and innovation engine at Deckers. Shifting to Teva global sales in the second quarter increased by 7% to $23 million. The universal and hurricane franchises continued to drive brand momentum so much so that Teva was able to regain the title of number one in market share within the sports sandal category for the spring 2019 season according to NPD. The brand had an impressive spring season both in terms of revenue performance and brand heat. Teva was featured in the New York Times as well as an article in Vogue that gave Teva the honor of being called shoe of summer. Congrats to the Teva team on a great spring season. Looking to fall, we are encouraged to see the Ember franchise and corresponding marketing campaign has continued to be an acquisition vehicle for the brand, driving a nearly 50% increase in search interest according to Google trends. Global sales in the second quarter were $11 million. Most of the decline versus last year is attributable to the weakness in the Yoga Sling franchise. As noted during our Q1 earnings call, we have made the strategic decision to exit the warehouse channel to focus on healthier full price channels. We expect sales volumes will continue to decline for the balance of FY \u201820 but remain focused on exploring healthier avenues for brand distribution as we work to reposition it in the marketplace. All of Deckers Brands and marketing teams are making great strides on building compelling product with targeted and diverse consumers in mind in conjunction with a strategic global marketing plan that enabled increased investments. Our brand, strong PR in addition to focus digital marketing efforts would drive first half performance and I look forward to additional progress in that front. Moving to channel performance in the second quarter. Global wholesale increased by 9% versus the prior year driven primarily by domestic expansion in UGG, HOKA and Koolaburra as well as international expansion of HOKA and Teva. Gains in HOKA and Teva internationally have mostly been driven by the strength of our Asia-Pacific region. In aggregate, international wholesale was slightly down versus the prior year due to the UGG reset in EMEA as well as negative pressure from foreign currency exchange rates. From a direct consumer perspective, comparable sales increased 7% versus the prior year with total DTC sales up 5% versus the second quarter last year. E-commerce continues to drive gains in the DTC channel which has been led by the strength of UGG and HOKA. The HOKA brands gains in DTC are shifting the channel mix dynamics for the brand which is leading to an improved gross margin profile. While largely sale in quarter, our second quarter performance was solid but the Deckers team remains focused on delivering our largest third quarter ever. I'm confident that with the recent momentum of the business, we are well positioned for the back half of the year. I will now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance as well as outlook for the third quarter in our full fiscal year. Steve? Thank you, Steve. As I look back in the first half of this year, I am encouraged by the progress we've made on our key initiatives. This includes investing in marketing to drive brand heat and awareness in HOKA UGG Men's and UGG Women's non-core, building our technology tools and talent base to advance analytical capabilities and drive efficiencies and how we connect with consumers, both existing and acquired and using innovation to develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio. I would like to thank all of the Deckers employees across the globe for their continued devotion to delivering strong results through the execution of our strategies. But before I turn the call over to Q&A as you may have seen in our earnings press release earlier this afternoon, Mike Devine has been appointed to the role of Chairman of the Board. Mike has been on the Board for the past eight years and assumes the role from John Gibbons. I look forward to working with Mike in this capacity. John will remain on the Board and I would like to thank him for his leadership as Chairman. The past few years have been transformational for Deckers and John has been a great partner in this journey. Jones' insight and expertise has been instrumental in our progress and I am extremely grateful for his contributions to the Deckers organization. And as always, I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I am excited about the opportunities in front of us and the direction our organization is headed. With that, we will now open the call to Q&A. Operator? Jon, this is Dave. The early deliveries were just opportunistic. Couple of our accounts were open to receiving some inventory a little bit earlier and we took advantage of that. But the setup for the quarter looks good. As you know, we've been working particularly in North America to really clean up the channel going into the season, coming out of a strong last year the inventory is very clean the accounts are set up. We've had a little bit of a warm start in the season but the sell-throughs are still going to wholesale and I think we are poised with the diversification efforts in the segmentation and allocation plans for a good quarter. Obviously, as you heard there some softness still in the European market. A lot of that is by design with the segmentation and allocation strategy in the market reset coming out of the UK there but still some macro headwinds with Brexit going on in the malaise of the UK consumer, but all in all, I think the way that we have been focusing on a younger consumer, diversifying the product offering, managing the marketplace very tightly, working with our key wholesale partners and going into the back half of the year with increased marketing investment, we feel we're in a solid position. We are hearing of some softness in the channel at a macro level. Obviously there is some news out there about top line softness and some of the wholesale partners managing tightly with their inventory. But as far as our brands that are particularly with UGG, Koolaburra and HOKA. We're still seeing healthy demand and good positioning. And great international opportunity. Continuing to see kind of that brand resonate on an international front and a lot more opportunity on that international front. As we said before, it's a multi-year strategy and we do have proof of concept with the strategy in North America, which took us 2 to 3 years to really get to the real strength of where we are now. So I would expect the same in Europe. This is really the first time that we have been pulling back on inventory with the allocation strategy and reducing the amount off price sales, part of what you're seeing in the takedown of the projection this year is the decision to not chase off price sales we're more focused on creating a healthy and long-term position for the UGG brand versus chasing a revenue number and I think that's the right thing to do. The teams have been working very hard on the allocation strategy there and making sure that each account is differentiated point of view and going after the right consumer with the appropriate product. My sense is, we'll come out at the end of this year in a much better inventory position and cleaner marketplace and then we can really start the reset going into FY \u201821 footfall \u201820. The first thing I would say is all of the product is performance-based and they're all built for running as our core and running in hiking obviously is our core target. That being said, a lot of our styles are being adopted by a non-runner consumer both on the fashion side as you see some of the HOKA brand and kind of the top fashion boutiques across the globe which is very exciting. But I think more importantly the average consumer from an athletic standpoint people are wearing HOKA, starting to run again or from our casual lifestyle perspective but the performance attributes of that ultra lightweight cushioned performance in that ride resonates with the casual consumer as well. And so I think you're starting to see a lot more consumers adopt it because they just love how it feels and hopefully some of those consumers are also getting back into running again at the same time. Yes. Yes. And as you said Sam, we're not expecting to play into that to need to do that in the European business but we do have the ability to do that if necessary in North America wholesale and I think as we have discussed on the last call, if there is upside to the seasons is probably more on the margin side than the sales right. So we're kind of implied in our guidance, it's roughly down about 90 basis points from last year. So the tax rate for Q3, we haven't given that but there is going to be some fluctuations between Q3 and Q4 but roughly, we're kind of modeling it like 21%-ish rate for Q3. And then I think your second question was just be \u2013 sorry, it was the wholesale breakout for UGG in Q2? Sure. Got it. So of the 542, 332 was UGG brand wholesale, roughly 51 million was HOKA brand wholesale, Teva with 17, Sanuk was 8 and Koolaburra was around 25. Thanks. Men's overall UGG for Q2? So other than just men's is growing faster than the average overall so men's is up more than the average. It's really focused on Q3. If you've seen our Neumel we kind of Neumel nation marketing campaign their efforts in the script very great, very positive response to that campaign. As we said that's driving interest of the brand and traffi, but the product is really a Q3 products, you should see the bigger impact of that business happening over the next couple of months, focused on the Neumel and winter boots. Yes, let me walk you a little bit, maybe just through the margin walk rather than kind of breaking it out. So a year ago we were at 50.2, this year we're at the 50.4, so 20 basis point improvement, about 50 basis points of improvement through margin expansion. So that's just achieving better margin on product as we continue to work on those efforts. We had, as I mentioned, part of the driver of the increase in our margin was really kind of better full price selling so less promotion better margins on our close out that was about 80 basis points. And then we have a take away really from FX about 70 basis points. The channel mix, because we had more wholesale growth that was about a 20 basis take away. And then kind of miscellaneous other stuff, roughly 20 basis point. So that's kind of the lock on the year-on-year. Yes, I mean you could where we're doing closeout out. So where we have reduced selling online was better as well as some of our traditional closeout through. I would say we've seen improvements in other weather-dependent categories. Absolutely. Sure. So you are right Tom. You've kind of got the numbers right. That is how we're looking at the back half of the year. It's a combination of the things that you mentioned. The big point will be the comparison that we have to last year. So we are assuming a higher promotional back half than what we saw last year. As you recall, last year was a pretty exceptional back half of the year, as we saw sell-through at full price incredibly strong, so not what we normally see which is kind of why we're taking a slightly more conservative approach as we look at the back half of this year but that will be the biggest component of the take-back, we'll see how the season plays out but we do have higher promotional environment factored into the back half. And then there is always a component of FX in there and then you'll have some impact potential with the tariff piece. So that's kind of how we are looking at it and we'll see how it plays out in terms of what the margin is, but you are right. And the biggest component of that will be our assumption around a more promotional environment than what we saw last year in the back half. This is Dave. We are not ready prepared to give that kind of guidance right now. I will say that we do think this has significant upside and the strength of the brand you're seeing now, we see that continuing going into FY \u201821 and beyond our sights are set above over the next 2 to 3 years, 500 million and beyond. Okay. Thank you. It's a great question and it's something that we're really excited about on a number of fronts. First is we are attracting a younger consumer and a large portion of that consumer is first-time purchases to our website. So it's serving as a vehicle for acquisition as well as driving the business for us in the short and long term. So we're going to continue the diversification efforts still using key partners in those use accounts to reach that consumer but it really is across the board where it's worth performing at least in North America, that style isn't resonating as well in places like China and outside of the UK just yet but the demand for that product going into the back half of the year and into next year is very strong and we think this is a franchise that we can build on through continued diversification efforts and design and marketing and distribution efforts for quite some time. Thank you."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. As Dave just mentioned, we have tremendous momentum in the business and have delivered a record second quarter. This quarter is yet another example of the progress we have made in growing our brands while at the same time, delivering improved levels of profitability. And now I will walk you through some of the elements of the quarter. Revenue was $542 million, up 8% versus last year and above the high end of our guidance range of $515 million to $525 million of the better than expected performance approximately $10 million was driven by the HOKA brand with exceptional results both in wholesale and direct to consumer channels with the balance of the be driven by earlier domestic wholesale shipments for the UGG brand. Overall, gross margins were up 20 basis points over last year to 50.4% this result was an improvement of our implied guidance with the main drivers of the variance to expectation coming from savings from the utilization of less expensive freight options, an improvement from higher gross margin rates on closeout sales and the favorable mix with the HOKA brand increasing its penetration to the total company beyond what we had anticipated, including incremental growth in e-commerce. These partially offset by channel mix as wholesale grew faster than DTC. In terms of SG&A expense, our dollar spend was up 8.9% to $175.9 compared to last year's GAAP spend of $161.5 million and up 9.1%, compared to last year's non-GAAP spend of $161.2 million. Spend was aligned with how we guided the quarter. This increase versus last year was driven primarily by incremental marketing investments that have been put in place to drive awareness around the HOKA brand, UGG men's product as well as the extended UGG women's offerings. This all resulted in earnings per share of $2.71 compared to last year's GAAP earnings per share of $2.48, last year's non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.38 and the high end of our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.25. The $0.46 beat to the high end of our guidance came from $0.15 of increased HOKA performance, $0.15 of favorable gross margins including savings in freight and a higher margin rate achieved on closeout sales, $0.10 from earlier domestic wholesale shipments from the UGG brand, $0.03 from reduced share count related to the repurchase of shares in the second quarter and $0.03 from a lower tax rate for the second quarter due to timing of discrete tax entries, partially offset by the reduced interest income. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock at an average price of $145.31 for a total of 155 million. As of September 30th, 2019, $160 million remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet at September 30th remains strong as cash and equivalence were $178 million down 2% from $182 million at September 30th of last year which includes repurchasing $155 million worth of shares during the second quarter. Inventory was up 8.5% to $559 million from $515 million at the same time last year. And we had 14 million in short-term borrowings under our credit line as compared to $71 million last year. Before moving on to our updated guidance, I'd like to reiterate the performance achieved in the first half of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first half of last year. Our portfolio of brands delivered $819 million in revenue, representing a 9% increase versus prior year driven by a disciplined approach to driving our key initiatives. Strong gross margins of 49.2% were achieved an increase of 46 basis points and even with the strategic reinvestment we experienced SG&A leverage with operating expense decreasing as a percentage of revenue. All of this, leading to a 27% increase in operating income for the first half of the year and then nearly 50% increase in earnings per share versus the first half of last year. Now moving on to our outlook, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $900 million which anticipates growth in the range of 1% to 3% this is on top of the strong increase that we experienced in the third quarter of last year. To provide some additional color on the brand elements, we expect UGG to be roughly flat as the domestic strength will be largely offset by international pressures. Strong growth with both the HOKA and Koolaburra brands, a year-over-year decline in the Teva EMEA business which will be offset with growth in Q4 due to the timing of the distributor orders, and lower sales in Sanuk, with this resulting in earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.40. Within our third quarter guidance, we expect global wholesale reorders for the UGG brand to equal cancellations and we are expecting an increase of promotional activity as compared to the prior two years. For fiscal year 2020, we are updating our financial guidance. We are increasing sales from our prior range of $2.1 billion to $2.125 billion to now be in the range of $2.115 billion to $2.14 billion an increase of $15 million. This increase in guidance reflects the strength and the momentum that we continue to see in the HOKA brand with the raise related to the second quarter performance as well as a lift on the balance of the year for the brand. Our expectations for the HOKA have continued to climb, well beyond our original outlook for the year. But it is important to keep in mind that with this increase our near-term ability to chase further incremental revenue for HOKA is limited due to timing of inbound inventory. As we have pivoted into the peak selling season for the UGG brand, our full year outlook for UGG remains consistent with our original guidance for fiscal 2020, at flat to low single-digit revenue growth. As previously mentioned our outlook assumes a higher level of promotional activity as compared to last year and remains unchanged for the back half of the year. To summarize our updated outlook for the full year at a brand level is as follows. UGG revenue expectations remain flat to up low-single digits. HOKA is now expected to be up in the mid to high 40% range, Teva is still expected to be approximately flat inclusive of the EMEA distributor channel shift, Sanuk is expected to be down in the 30% range and Koolaburra is still expected to grow in the mid 50% range. Turning to the remainder of the P&L, gross margins are expected to be approximately 50.8% SG&A as a percent of sales are anticipated to be slightly lower than 36%, operating margins are now expected to be approximately 15% and we are raising our expected earnings per share to be in the range of $8.90 to $9.05 on a newly updated share count of approximately 28.7 million shares with a full year tax rate of 20.5%. The roughly $0.45 raise in earnings per share is being driven by increases of $0.20 from higher HOKA brand sales including the second quarter beat and raised expectations for the back half of the year, $0.20 related to the second quarter share repurchase and $0.15 from favorable second quarter gross margins. These partially offset by $0.10 of additional expense added in the second half as we continue to shift our expense profile from fixed to variable spend allowing us to reinvest in our key initiatives and support our increased full year revenue outlook. Our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges as well as the effect of any future share repurchase. Additionally, we believe that we have been able to mitigate any material impact from tariffs in the current fiscal year 2020. On that topic we are continuing to assess the impact of tariff policy decisions going forward. As there still a lot of factors to work through, we are not yet providing an estimate on the impact beyond fiscal year 2020. We are evaluating options that can potentially offset these increased costs including considerations of pricing power within our brands as well as continuing conversations with our suppliers who are willing to work with us. As a reminder, we have stated that less than 20% of our current global production is created in China and shipped to the United States. During this period, we also provide an update on our sheepskin pricing. We continue to see stable prices in the sheepskin market and we expect no change in the sheepskin costs for fiscal 2021. This does not constitute our gross margin guidance for next year as our sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margins. With our strong first half results behind us, we remain confident in delivering the expectations outlined for the balance of the fiscal year. Our full year guidance implies second half revenue growth of 2% to 4% versus last year. This is on top of the 5% growth achieved in the second half of fiscal 2019. To summarize our full year guidance, we are now projecting top line growth in the range of 5% to 6% with the intention of delivering a 15% operating margin. To achieve this, the Deckers organization is focused on executing our strategies in the upcoming peak holiday season. And while there is work ahead of us, I would like to thank the team for their continued dedication and energy put into our brands every day. With that, I will now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks. This is Steve. Jon, just to add on that as we look at the UGG domestic wholesale business, it's good channel for us. It is relatively clean which is why our customers want product and we have an ability to ship on products, so we'll take advantage of that. As Dave said, international will be down as we reset Europe but other than that all the signs are good at this point and the product is resonating. I think one of the beauties of Deckers and platform that we've been working on over the last few years to really improve our capabilities across the board is to be able to support the growth in the hyper growth of the HOKA brand and obviously with the margin profile of that brand, the efficiencies we've created across the organization, we're well positioned to continue to invest not only just in marketing dollar but innovation design, sourcing of that brand and for the distribution globally. So it's exceeding our expectations. We're in a little bit of chase mode on inventory, but we're in good shape to be able to capture as a demand at this point. We are planning for continued strong growth in that brand. And so you'll see as we guide the beginning going into FY \u201821 continued investment to be able to continue the growth of that brand and it's really a global opportunity. As you know, North America wholesale and DTC is very strong for that brand, but we're seeing tremendous growth still in Europe, Japan and we haven't really started going after China yet. So very pleased very excited with the acceptance and the demand coming from the consumer. The innovation pipeline is still strong and the signs that will be coming out in the next 6 to 12 months we feel we'll continue that momentum and we're going to continue to invest in it. Yes. Yes. We worked hard to get to this point and I give the teams a lot of credit for their discipline while at the same time, we're really building strong healthy brands across our global marketplace and I think for us, there's no looking back we're continuing down this path. We think that we have some very meaningful and important brands for the consumer and our wholesale partners and we believe that we can continue this level of growth in mid-single digits and then 15% operating margin for the foreseeable future for sure. Thanks. Jon thanks. Sam, so we're expecting in our guidance increased level of promotion over last year. We think that will be wholesale with some of the retailers that we're working with so that's what we've embedded. We'll see how it plays out, right? The biggest part of our season is still ahead of us. We'll see how the consumer shows up. Early signs are good sell through, clear inventory. So it's a kind of a wait and see and we'll see kind of what happens but where it's mostly factored is kind of in wholesale with a little bit that you'll see in our DTC business. We haven't given anything out on \u201821. It's something clearly that we'll look at, I wouldn't right now factor in kind of anything from a significant expense reduction, a lot of the work that we're doing is kind of with the infrastructure that we have. So once we get back to growth, we will need infrastructure to support that growth. So there will be able to kind of use our existing infrastructure to lever growth as we return to growth on the International. So from that standpoint again, we haven't given guidance on next year but I wouldn't expect a significant fall off. I think to the earlier question about how we look at our P&L profile looking at a 15% operating margin we're going to spend appropriately as we have now seen a lot of our gross margin efforts come through and then the shift to variable that we're talking about is really about how we invest more in marketing to drive the initiatives to build brand awareness around the things that we're doing so building awareness with HOKA, building awareness with men with UGG building awareness with spring-summer women's UGG as well. And when we look at that is still a lot of opportunity. Yes. I can take that. So you want it in total wholesale? That's it's a great question and I think if have been our Deckers website. I'll start there, couple of years ago we put out some sustainability goals we call 7 x 27 that have guided a lot of the activities around sustainability for Deckers but also each of our brands and over the last 3 to 6 months each of the brands is doing individual work to improve the way they operate across the planet, both in product and kind of operational periods as well. I can't get into all the specifics that are happening right now but there is work being done and you're going to see some more conversations happening in the marketplace with each of our brands around efforts they are making, but it's probably best at a brand level versus the Deckers level to focus into that because there is unique approaches to this space based on the brand positioning and the relevancy in that marketplace and for the consumer, But I am excited to say that is something that Deckers as an organization is taking seriously. We are standing behind it with our global 7/27 goals and within each of the brand and the work that they're doing and I think you will see some continued evolution in the product that we're bringing to market on the short term. And with regards to the weather question, for the UGG brand generally speaking, the whole brand is somewhat weather-dependent with the exception of probably slippers but what we've been doing over the last few years is to reduce our dependency on cold weather-related products. So for example we have reduced the reliance on core classic, we brought a lot more fashion boots into the assortment across men's and women's. I think some of the diversified product that you've seen toward the younger consumer is a less weather-dependent diversifying into men's is less reliant on the core classic business. So we're used to be kind of a one-trick pony, which is at the core classic across all the channels, the diversification efforts, fashion ability of the brand, the diversification across new consumers has given us more fashion relevance and less weather-dependentcy across the board and I think that served well last year and it's only stronger this year and it gives us something that's going to continue to evolve. So it's less certainly we're still dependent on the weather just like everybody else's but I think we're much more fashion relevant to the consumer now that is looking for product from just beyond kind of cold weather product. I would say so. Thanks. Yes, it's still about two-third domestic, one-third international. I think the way we are looking at freight historically up to last year we used more air freight. I think we've gotten better at bringing product in, so that's help alleviate some of that need to bring in air freight. We have used a little bit more this year than we did last year as we're bringing inventory in where we see spikes in demand largely like HOKA. So I think we are demonstrated by our margin improvement, we are better at how we're bringing product and we've been working with our factories doing better job level loading them, that's helping us bring inventory in. It's also helping us schedule a little bit better. It is also showing up as we bring inventory in a little bit earlier as well. So I think through a lot of the efforts and the margin improvements that we're achieving, we're kind of seeing that pay off. So, we'll always use some air freight. We didn't use quite as much as what we had anticipated in our guidance in Q2. We did use some but not nearly to the extent that we thought we would and it's something that we'll continue to look at. So, to your question things have changed and improved. I think we're doing a slightly better job but there will always be cases where you're going to have to use some of it, especially when you have kind of hot product and a brand that's in demand like HOKA. General cost of freight overall is not coming down. Yes. The piece, I think that you might be missing is the UGG international wholesale is down and that's driven by the reset that we're talking about in Europe as well as a currency impact on our international business. Yes, it's \u2013 we are up, it's a small number. You nailed it. So the promotion is down more than the total because we have some positive offsets. So DTC on the 542 was, call it $99 million. A year ago we did just under $94 million. So the total DTC was up, now that will be all brands. You will see it on the queue when it comes out, but the UGG DTC was down and the down will be some fewer retails as well as more challenge in retail. Okay."

Good afternoon, everyone. As shown by the first quarter results posted this afternoon, we are off to a solid start in fiscal year 2020. For the quarter, our portfolio of brands posted gains in revenue as well as earnings versus the prior year with the most material contribution of topline growth coming from HOKA ONE ONE brand as new product launches paired with enhanced marketing activations continued to build brand momentum.In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue was up 10% versus last year to $277 million. We delivered gross margin of 47% and a loss per share of $0.67. These results are above the high end of guidance that we provided for the quarter as we benefited from earlier delivery of wholesale and distributor shipments in the UGG brand and saw continued success in the HOKA brand including the boost from the introduction of the Carbon X.The strength seen in the first quarter provides us with added confidence in achieving our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, which Steve will walk you through later in the call.The results for the quarter are a testament to the work our teams are doing to strengthen our brands by bringing compelling product and experiences to our consumer.As I look at the industry, I see Deckers leading in innovation with two of the most exciting product launches this season in the HOKA Carbon X and the UGG fluff franchise.We're making progress in reshaping our business and I believe our investments in marketing and innovation will continue to push our brand ahead of the competition.I'll now review the highlights from the quarter starting with the fashion lifestyle group. UGG global sales in the first quarter were up 2% over last year to $139 million, driven by high teens increase in domestic sales. The strength of our domestic business was fueled by both wholesale and DTC growth.As was planned, international sales were down versus last year, but we're in the early stages of a marketplace reset in our EMEA region as we better position our brands in the marketplace.As I think about the progress we are making, I'm excited that consumers are finding more to love in the UGG brand's spring and summer offering. This year, we have seen US search interest rise by 50% over last year.In addition, UGG has also seen a significant increase in the key 18 to 34-year-old demographic where the number of online purchases in the quarter grew by 86% versus the previous year.And aligned with our company's initiative around digital growth, UGG Rewards is starting to make a noticeable impact, with nearly 40% of US e-commerce revenue being driven by loyalty customers.From a revenue perspective, UGG gained a significant incremental dollar contribution from the newly introduced fluff collection. Our marketing activations, including a partnership with Born This Way Foundation, help drive excitement around the entire collection of fluff product which we feel is unique to UGG and true to the brand's DNA.The fluff collection is driving incredibly high sell-through rates as well as attracting new consumers to the brand. The collection has been praised by high-end publications and positively endorsed by a number of high profile celebrities. Importantly, brand attention is being gained in the seasonal period in which UGG has traditionally not been top of mind.Partially offsetting the UGG brand's Q1 performance was the soft start to the sandal season as a result of rainy conditions across much of the country early in the quarter. It is also important to note that our strategy of controlling marketplace supply of core product, which is designed to reduce the sales of core product during Q1 in order to drive sales of true spring and summer product, also impacted the brand's top line results.That said, we believe this is an important step towards building a more meaningful spring business for UGG. I'm encouraged by domestic growth and the progress the brand is making towards a healthier mix of product.Just three years ago, more than half of products sold during our first quarter were autumn and winter boots. However, this year, we reduced the mix of boots to less than 40%. On top of that, UGG was once again a top 10 spring brand at Nordstrom, capturing healthy growth versus the prior year and is performing exceptionally well at Nordstrom's anniversary sale.This is further evidence that UGG is able to address counter seasonal demand in the spring and summer timeframe and remains focused on building traction in styles that are incremental to the core offering.Turning to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk.Beginning with HOKA, the brand's investments in product innovation as well as its story sharing philosophy are propelling the brand forward as evidenced by first quarter performance with revenue growth of 69% versus the prior year, with equal strength both domestically and internationally, more than doubling new consumer acquisition versus the prior year and the Carbon X launch which drove nearly 800 million impressions globally and delivered strong sales online, 40% of which were first time DTC purchasers.I'm incredibly proud of the collaborative effort to launch the Carbon X this last May. Carbon X was designed as a limited release that has exceeded sales expectations. Consumers are raving about the experience of the Carbon X as seen by overwhelmingly positive online product reviews.We feel the Carbon X launch event impressions drove serious momentum in brand awareness, leading up to a key release in our Clifton franchise.In June, the brand introduced the Clifton 6, the most innovative update to one of HOKA's core franchises. Despite just one month of availability in the marketplace, the Clifton 6 has driven very high sell-through rates and is ranked as the number one or two shoe of any brand in nearly all US wholesale specialty running accounts.This is a testament to the HOKA team's dedication to franchise management and ability to improve on a popular product through the commitment to innovation.In conjunction with these new product launches, HOKA continues to invest in building awareness. As a result, the brand recently entered a partnership with Lifetime Fitness, creating an authentic engagement opportunity with a potential to attract new consumers into the HOKA ecosystem.HOKA and Lifetime seek to empower people in all aspects of their health journey through numerous activations that showcase real and positive change regardless of size or scale.Shifting to Teva, the brand outperformed our expectations by about $2 million, but declined by 4% versus last year due to the strategic decision to adjust the European wholesale model from direct to distributor.For the quarter, the brand experienced impressive growth in both the Universal and Hurricane franchises.Moving to Sanuk, for the quarter, sales came in approximately $3 million below our expectation, primarily due to the softness in the yoga sling franchise. As we've done over the past two years, we continue to evaluate our distribution opportunities across our entire portfolio of brands.Aligned with the organization's commitment to strong brand management, we've made the strategic decision to exit the warehouse channel with our Sanuk brand.While this decision will have a negative impact on fiscal 2020 revenue, it's the right move for the health of the brand. Moving forward, this provides a better environment for Sanuk to focus on other underpenetrated channels.Moving to channel performance, wholesale increased 11% over last year, driven primarily by domestic expansion of UGG and HOKA. As a note, part of the increased wholesale volume was due to the timing of UGG shipments, which Steve will walk you through later in the call.In total, our domestic wholesale business grew by 15% versus prior year despite this being the first time that we constrained selling of UGG core classic products during the first quarter.Aligned with the strategy, we worked with our wholesale customers to shift the use of open-to-buy dollars for true spring and summer product, while at the same time reducing the amount of closeouts year-over-year.Strength domestically was also driven by HOKA growth as the brand gained market share in existing accounts and experienced increased volume in both the Clifton and Bondi franchises, benefiting from the additional brand attention due to the Carbon X launch in May.Domestic wholesale strength was partially offset by softness in our international UGG business. As we have previously indicated, we continue to see headwinds on the international front for the brand, but are addressing with the learnings we've gained from our implemented distribution strategies in the US market.Our HOKA brand continues to gain momentum within international wholesale as the brand is building important awareness during its early stages of growth outside the US.We are engaging in marketing activities that are impactful on a global scale. Specifically, we are beginning to see the benefits of these marketing activations, including our Carbon X launch and HOKA's sponsorship of ironman events in countries around the world.From a DTC perspective, comparable sales increased 16%, with total direct-to-consumer sales up 10% versus last year's first quarter. This was led by strong performance from our e-commerce channel where both UGG and HOKA contributed materially to the growth and exceeded our expectations. Similar to our wholesale channel, our domestic direct-to-consumer business was the primary driver of growth.Overall, Deckers has delivered another strong performance. Though it remains our smallest quarter, I'm proud of the progress we've made to increase the size of our spring and summer business as we have grown our first quarter revenue by 32% over the past two years.I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance as well as outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just mentioned, we are encouraged with our start to the year and now I would like to take you through our first quarter financial results, then provide details on our outlook for the second quarter and updated full fiscal year 2020.Please note that, throughout this discussion, I refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures for comparable prior-year results. Where I refer to these non-GAAP financial measures, I'm referring to results before taking into account non-recurring charges that our management believes are not core to our ongoing operating results.Also note, our non-GAAP results are not adjusted for constant currency with the exception of our direct-to-consumer comparable sales.While we did not have any non-GAAP financial adjustments for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a reconciliation between our reported GAAP and non-GAAP results for the prior-year can be found in our earnings release that is posted on our website under the Investors tab.Now to our results. For the first quarter, revenue was $277 million, up 10% to last year and above our high guidance of $260 million. Compared to our guidance, approximately $7 million of the revenue upside was related to timing of UGG brand shipments, approximately $3 million was from stronger UGG DTC performance and the majority of the remaining balance was driven by outperformance with the HOKA brand.More specifically, UGG timing upside was from early shipment of wholesale orders globally that were originally anticipated for the second quarter. The stronger UGG DTC performance was driven by strong adoption of spring summer styles led by our fluff franchise.And the strength of our HOKA brand was driven by the Clifton 6 introduction and bolstered by the launch of Carbon X.As we look at the first quarter, we are very pleased to see success with these drivers of the business as we continue to shift business to spring summer quarters. Not only through the diversification of the UGG offering, but also through the accelerated growth of the HOKA brand, which has a much more balanced distribution across all four quarters.In comparison to last year, the revenue increase was predominantly HOKA, which benefited from the new styles such as the Carbon X and the newly redesigned Clifton 6.Gross margins were up 109 basis points over last year, to 47% and in line with expectation. The main drivers of the year-over-year increase were favorable mix of brand revenue, gross margin rate expansion, fewer closeout sales, with gains partially offset by channel mix as well as currency headwinds.To provide more detail, the favorable mix of brand revenue and the gross margin rate expansion was driven by HOKA, which carries a higher gross margin than other brands in the first quarter due to seasonality.At the same time, it is experiencing successful full price selling of core product and offerings within our category extensions.Related to the improvements in closeouts, we have improved our distribution model and have become less reliant on closeout volume in the first quarter, primarily driven by the UGG brand as we have shifted our focus to selling more season appropriate styles in the period.Moving to SG&A, our dollar spend was $161.4 million, up 4.6% from last year's GAAP SG&A spend of $154.4 million and up 4.9% to last year's non-GAAP SG&A spend of $153.9 million. The increase in the prior-year in SG&A was driven by incremental marketing spend of approximately $6 million.In comparison to implied guidance, we experienced savings in the first quarter largely coming from reduced marketing originally intended for the first quarter as we saw opportunity to move this spend to later in the year with positive organic search trends tracking in the first quarter and favorable payroll costs as we experienced deferred hiring of certain headcount.During the quarter, we also received a tax refund. More specifically, we finalized a settlement related to prior years. As a result of the settlement and receiving the refund in the quarter, we recognize the full amount in Q1.While we expected to receive payment this year and our guidance for the year assumed this, we were uncertain of the timing and therefore it was factored into the rate for the full year and spread across the year.This all resulted in a loss per share that came in at $0.67 compared to last year's GAAP loss of $1 and last year's non-GAAP loss of $0.98. This also compares to a guidance range of a loss of a $1.25 to a loss of $1.15.The $0.48 beat to our high guidance of loss per share came from approximately $0.14 from the tax refund recorded in the quarter, $0.10 from earlier shipment of UGG wholesale orders, $0.10 from increased performance in the HOKA brand, $0.10 from operating expense savings driven by the delayed hiring as well as marketing spend that is now planned and moved later in the year, and $0.05 from stronger of UGG DTC performance.Our balance sheet at June 30 remains strong as cash and equivalents were $503 million, up from $418 million at June 30 of last year.Inventory was up 9% to $473 million from $436 million at the same time last year. And similar to last year, we had no material short-term borrowings under our credit lines.During the quarter, we repurchased 227,000 shares of the company's common stock at an average price of $154.36 for a total of $35 million. As of June 30, 2019, $315 million remains available under our share repurchase authorization.Now, moving on to our outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.When combined with our first quarter performance, this outlook provides a strong first half expectation for fiscal 2020, including revenue growth for the first half of roughly 5% to 6.5% when compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the range of $0.08 to $0.18, representing approximately 6% to 13% growth versus the first half of last year.As we have now completed our US distribution center consolidation, I think it is important to note that we have planned for a more level loaded quarter-end. As a result, we anticipated that some UGG product that has traditionally shipped in the final week of Q2 will now ship in Q3 as we ramp up our first year and we create more efficiencies with our distribution operations.Now, for our full fiscal year 2020, we are raising our guidance to account for the better-than-expected performance in Q1. The upside we are flowing through to the full-year guidance equates to $0.20 in earnings per share.Our updated full-year guidance includes raising our revenue expectation to the range of $2.1 billion to $2.125 billion, with recognition that our outlook for the HOKA brand has been lifted, now assuming sales are growing in the high 30% range for the year, partially offset by reductions in the Sanuk domestic wholesale business related to the decision to eliminate distribution in the warehouse channel.And upside in the UGG business that we saw in Q1 is now projected to be offset by currency headwinds in the rest of the year.Gross margins are expected to be approximately 50.5%, SG&A at or slightly better than 36% as we defer a portion of our first quarter savings to marketing efforts and technology investments later in the year, all generating an operating margin of approximately 14.5%.Also, based on an updated view on tax, we now expect our rate to be 20.5% for the full fiscal year. These updates, combined with the share repurchase executed in the first quarter, we are raising our earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 now to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.60 on a share count of approximately 29.4 million shares.This $0.20 raise in earnings per share guidance for the full year is being driven by approximately $0.06 from the net impact of the revised revenue expectation driven by the full year increase in HOKA projections, partially offset by the strategic reset in Sanuk; $0.06 from operating expense savings from the first quarter; $0.05 from the better tax rate, now reflecting an estimated 20.5% for the full year effective tax rate; and $0.03 from the recent share repurchase activity in the first quarter.Our guidance for the second quarter in fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges as well as the effect of any future share repurchase.Recognizing there have been recent movements in foreign currency exchange rates, we are partially hedged for our exposure in this fiscal year and our updated guidance incorporates the impact of our exposure on any unhedged amounts.We believe that the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation remains at approximately a 40 basis point headwind on our margins.On tariffs, we continue to monitor tariff policy decisions closely and still do not anticipate any financial impact related to the recently imposed tariffs.As a reminder, we have stated that less than 20% of our current global production is created in China and shipped to the United States.To further mitigate current risk of exposure to potential new tariffs on China imports, we have taken the opportunity to receive some inventory ahead of the normal cadence, which is partially contributing to the 9% increase in our total inventory balance at June 30, 2019 as compared to levels at the same point last year.With that, I'll now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, Steve. While our first quarter exceeded expectations, it remains the smallest period in our fiscal year and there is still heavy lifting ahead of us to meet our objectives for the year.That said, I am excited about the progress we continue to make within the organization as we reinvest in marketing tactics to drive brand heat and awareness, fueling growth within UGG men's, UGG women's non-core and the HOKA, with increases in digital outreach, experiential marketing and event driven spend as we build our technology and tools with added talent that will advance our analytical capabilities and create new ways to connect with consumers and develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio in the future.Going forward, the organization remains dedicated to continuous innovation. Our design, development and innovation teams have been significant contributors in pushing the boundaries of product innovation for Deckers. And we look forward to seeing continued enhancements in the near future.I'd like to thank all of our employees across the Deckers organization for their exceptional efforts in this past quarter and their continued commitment to the successful execution of our strategies.With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Jonathan Komp from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah, hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the strength you're seeing, especially domestically, with UGG, given the strategy to deemphasize the classics and really focus on some new product categories that are working in the non-core periods. Dave, when you forward and kind of look at the success you're seeing with that strategy, does that at all change how you're viewing kind of the product strategy going forward in the seasons ahead and anything you can talk to about kind of the next evolution in some of the core seasons as you continue to deemphasize the classics?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. That's a great question. And it's pretty exciting momentum to see the momentum that the team is building in North America, particularly through all of our channels. And what's great about it is we are driving the business through new introductions of spring and summer product. And as you heard on the earnings script, the shift away from reliance on boots in the quarter and the growth coming from new product introductions in seasonally relevant product such as the fluff franchisor, which is a massive success for us, is \u2013 we're learning a lot from that. It's also allowing us to reach new consumers and bring new new consumers and younger consumers into the brand, which is great because they traditionally come in through the classic and then explore more of the brand. But we're seeing a large number of younger consumers coming directly to the brand for the first time, particularly in our DTC channels, purchasing that product that they're wearing in season.So, it gives us a lot of confidence that if we hit the right product design, coupled with the right social and PR strategy and marketing tactics, that we can really move the needle in these categories and in the quarter. It also tells us that big ideas in product, something that is distinctly UGG in DNA and disruptive in the marketplace is a method for us to continue to drive success in new categories.So, we had a fantastic meeting with the UGG product team yesterday and talked about the learnings from fluff here and how we translate that into future seasons across different categories and also into men's. And I think you're going to see more of these more sizable, meaningful launches. Fewer bigger launches is the approach for us going forward. But now that we have the attention of younger consumer and credibility in spring and summer gives us a lot of confidence going forward. And then, we just need to employ the same strategy globally.\nJonathan Komp: Are you willing to share any kind of thoughts on where that can go in terms of some of the new categories? I know, for UGG, you've talked about the sneaker opportunity from time to time, but any additional thoughts there?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. I've always been a fan \u2013 we've always said the money is in the middle. So, it's kind of new innovations that are probably crossovers or hybrids of two categories. So, we'll have limited success and we can be successful in pure sneakers, but I think it's the mashup of sneakers and sandals, so you can provide the comfort with the UGG DNA. That's something that's unique that nobody else can do. I think that's where the strength of our brand is. And we have quite a few products within that coming out of our innovation team and our design team.It's interesting. This fluff product is \u2013 in our P&L, it's classified as a slipper, but the consumer sees it as a sandal. And so, I think that tells you that it has broader shoulders and it's very disruptive and interesting, and it's something that nobody else can do. And I think that's the formula going forward.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah, great. And then, just a follow-up, Steve, on the guidance. Just to understand \u2013 sorry if I missed it. Did you update at all what you're expecting UGG to grow for the full year, if there's any changes there? And then, the new guidance for HOKA as well, is that just flowing through the first quarter upside and not really changing the balance-of-the-year assumptions?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Good question, Jon. We really aren't changing the UGG. So, kind of positive low single-digits is what the guidance is for the year related the UGG brand. No change there. There is a significant change in HOKA. So, I think before we were in the mid-20 range and we're now in the higher 30% range. So, that's where you're seeing an uptake on HOKA, but it is being offset by the Sanuk takeback as we pulled out of that warehouse channel. But, net-net, still an increase on the full year revenue number.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. And HOKA, just to understand it, it looks like you're kind of around 30% or a little below for the balance of the year in terms of implied growth after the big growth in the first quarter. So, just curious if you changed your assumptions after the first quarter at all for HOKA?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. So, it is up a little bit. You're right. We saw tremendous growth in the current quarter. That's the 69% that we're talking about, so well ahead. As we get into later quarters in the year, those are bigger historic quarters for HOKA. So, that's why the growth rate will drop a little bit on a percentage term.\nJonathan Komp: Okay, got it. All right. Thank you very much.\nDavid Powers: Okay. Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nKelly McClintock: Hi. This is Kelly on for Paul. Thanks for taking my question. On the UGG US wholesale business, you're still seeing strong momentum there. could you just shed some light on how much that growth over the last couple of years has been driven by expanding distribution in places like Macy's, Amazon versus organic growth in core wholesale accounts?\nDavid Powers: Kelly, this is Dave. I think what you're seeing this quarter is very little increased distribution over last year. We spent the last three years or so in incubating new distributions such as Macy's and Urban Outfitters and Foot Locker and a couple of smaller kind of boutiques, in addition to the important department stores. And we've actually closed more accounts than we've opened. So, what we've been doing is consolidating, elevating to the key players in the industry. And so , the majority of the growth you're seeing now is increased door count within those channels or within those stores \u2013 or chains, I should say, sorry. Burt just better penetration and sell-through across the board. So, we're seeing it both in wholesale with those accounts and also in our DTC channel.\nKelly McClintock: Great. Thank you. Just on 2Q in particular, I know there were some timing shifts around UGG, some of that benefitting the first quarter. And I think you mentioned some shifting into the third quarter. So, could you just provide a little bit more detail on where you're planning the UGG business in the second quarter?\nSteven Fasching: Sure, Kelly. What we have is we'll have the UGG business compared to last year down just a little bit, and that's really that shifting into Q3. So, we did bring kind of $10 million forward into Q1 and then we'll have a little bit going out on the back end from Q2 to Q3. So, that's the, call it, down kind of low-single digits.\nKelly McClintock: Okay. And lastly, just on the HOKA brand, just curious the margin profile there. How does that compare to the company average? And are there any opportunities to expand margins there over time?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. So, the margins on HOKA, as we've kind of said, are very similar to UGG in the channel, so in wholesale similar channels, in DTC similar margins. So, very strong margins. As we indicated on the prepared remarks, what's also helping drive some of the HOKA is less closeout that we're seeing. And so, we can continue to kind of drive that full price selling. It was a very clean quarter. So, I don't know how much more upside there is kind of on the surface within channel. Clearly, there's upside as we drive more DTC business with the HOKA business. So, from a channel mix, there's more opportunity as we make our DTC business with HOKA bigger.\nKelly McClintock: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Licero from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead with your question.\nRoss Licero: Thank you for taking my question. Can you give a little more color on the [indiscernible]?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. Help me out a little bit. What are you looking for in terms of\u2026?\nRoss Licero: I guess, just trends from April, May, June. Have they improved at all? And then, just a follow-up on that. Now that the weather has improved for sandals, have you seen that reflecting in the sales?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. I think, interestingly, the months were pretty steady. They were strong from the get-go and the beginning of the quarter. In HOKA, it was really ignited by the launch of the Carbon X and the PR and the press and the buzz that the brand got from that launch. And then, when we officially launched Clifton 6, that maintained the momentum. So, that's been pretty steady through the quarter. UGG was a little bit softer in the beginning due to some of the sandal challenges, but that was offset by the fluffy ad [ph] franchise and that's continued to be strong through the quarter. So, they were pretty steady all along.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. I would say on that, just what we observed is kind of that normal cadence. We definitely see a pickup in the latter half of the quarter. I think as we saw kind of within the industry, there was some softness with the industry. I think we saw strength with UGG and a normal cadence within the quarter and a normal cadence of the business picking up kind of later in the quarter.\nRoss Licero: Okay, great. And then, can you talk about how the men's business is doing for UGG and I guess how it's performing relative to your expectations?\nDavid Powers: The men's business is still small in Q4 and Q1 for that gender. The strength of men's, where we're really seeing the growth is coming in in Q2 and Q3, really driven by the new mail franchise. So, we had some good product launches in sneakers and shoes, but they weren't enough to really move the needle in men's. So, we have work to do, an opportunity, I would say, for men's in that time of year. And we had a good meeting on that yesterday and some of the learnings that we're taking from women's in the fluff franchise and other categories and translating that into men's for spring and summer. But the real strength of men's, where we're seeing the growth, is definitely in fall winter through the new mail and with the boot category at this point.\nRoss Licero: Great. Thanks a lot.\nDavid Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us the specifics on how much UGG \u2013 both UGG and HOKA wholesale and retail grew? I know it's coming out in the Q, but that would help us a lot. And then, I've got a couple of other ones too.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Sam, breaking out the channel outperformance, we'll let that come out in the Q. But good, I would say. From the numbers that we've reflected, kind of, clearly, HOKA very strong wholesale performance globally. So, not only North America business, very strong HOKA performance really across the globe.I think from a wholesale perspective on UGG, we saw strong performance domestically in the wholesale channel and internationally kind of more to expectation. But that's on the international front as we indicated in the prepared remarks, kind of more where we saw some early shipments. But, again, from a global perspective, if you take out the early shipments, wholesale performed pretty much to kind of what we expected with a little bit of overperformance in our DTC channel related to UGG in North America.\nSam Poser: Thank you. Okay. I've got a couple more things. Number two, sticking with UGG, how many dollars moved from Q3 to Q2? Because you said, part of the guidance for in Q1 was shifting from Q1 to Q4. So, why wouldn't \u2013 if demand is good, isn't this just going to keep shifting? Or you just don't know that yet and you're being discretion is the better part of valor?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. So, it's a good question. I think one of the things that we're seeing, right, and it's a little bit harder for us to just predict is that, as inventory channels \u2013 they were clean last year, they're even cleaner this year. What we're seeing is, with the success of UGG, that retailers are asking for product earlier because they want to make sure that they have the product. And so, that's where we're seeing the shift. It's good indication of the strength and health of the brand, but it's hard to know exactly. One, they're seeing strong sell-through. They also want to make sure that they're getting product for the fall sell-out. So, that's where we're seeing kind of people taking it earlier this year than where they have, say, a year or two ago. And we'll fulfill it. Like we've said, we will guide and project to kind of what we see on the order book. But also, if a customer is asking for a product sooner than that, we'll be ready to deliver it.And then, just to note, really kind of on the shift out of Q2 to Q3, that's us being a little bit conservative with the first year of our consolidated DC. A year ago, we looked at really the last week and there is a lot of activity that goes out that last week of the quarter. So, as we have consolidated our DC, we were pushing a little bit of that out into Q3. Now, we may get orders where customers want a little bit sooner, but we want to balance out that load because it's a big load in that final week. And so, we want to be mindful of what our capacity is and kind of constraints with the new consolidated DC.\nSam Poser: And then, lastly, Teva wholesale, can you give us what the wholesale equivalent revenue would have been given the shift of the European business?\nDavid Powers: I think it's $3 million to $4 million on that shift.\nSteven Fasching: About $4 million shift.\nSam Poser: So, what would HOKA \u2013 what would Teva have been if it had just been as normal \u2013 if it was apples to apples. Would you have been up \u2013 you would have been up a little. You would have had a [indiscernible]? You probably would have been like 4%, 5%, is that right?\nDavid Powers: Yeah, that's correct.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, that's about right.\nSam Poser: And are you still pleased with the fact that you've done this now that things are getting better? Are they getting better because you've done [indiscernible]?\nDavid Powers: Maybe a little bit of both. I think it was the right call. It allows the European teams to focus on our core businesses and then have somebody who is strong in the region focus on expanding the Teva business in a local way. We'll continue to evaluate it over time, but I think it was the right thing as we were looking at profit improvements and focus on the organization. It's great to see that the distributors managing the business so well, which means the teams are working closely with those partners and they have the expertise required. So, I would say it was the right call. We're pleased with how it's going. And it gives us an opportunity to reevaluate down the road.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Continued success.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Nikic from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nTom Nikic: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit of modeling minutia about the, I guess, your three smaller brands. I guess I'll start with Sanuk. You've got the pullback of the distribution in the US. Should we assume that that down 20%, 25% that you saw in Q1 is basically what it should look like across the balance of the year?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. I think that's fair. Yeah.\nTom Nikic: All right. Teva, I think last time you guided it flat. It was down a little bit in Q1. Should we still assume flat for the year or should we assume maybe it's down a little bit because of the shift?\nDavid Powers: No, flattish.\nSteven Fasching: Flat with the shift.\nTom Nikic: All right. And then just lastly, I don't think there was anything mentioned about the Koolaburra on the call. Just how should we think about for the\u2026?\nDavid Powers: So, kind of same as what we've said before. We don't see much change there, but significant growth. So, kind of up mid 50% range is kind of how we're looking at that. Yeah, Q1 is really not a Koolaburra quarter. You'll start to see that really ramp up.\nTom Nikic: All right. Sounds good. Thanks very much.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\nJim Duffy: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Great start to year. I wanted to ask about HOKA and maybe talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about the opportunity. Do you have any consumer insights you can share on awareness, the age demographics, repeat purchase frequency, that type of thing?\nDavid Powers: Yeah. I think it's safe to say the awareness is increasing. I think the last time we looked at it, North America was roughly around the 12%. I don't have the exact figures in front of me, but it's definitely improving. And I think you're seeing that as resulting in the sales. The top of funnel exercises that the team have been doing, particularly the Carbon X event, which was a massive success, the way the team has pulled that off with breaking two world records in an event, that was resonating on a global scale and launching a brand-new innovative product. That brought 800 million and growing, I should say, still improving impression to the brand on a global level. So, the awareness is improving.The average age, it's a little bit older than we would like, I think, and so there's opportunity to target younger consumers through some of our marketing tactics. I just had a conversation with a brand on that yesterday. But it's also a higher price point product. So, we need to make sure that we're balancing out the high level of our performance and technical characteristics of that product and price point with shoes like the Rincon which we just launched which is a little bit more affordable price point, little bit more for an everyday runner.And I forget, what was the third point you just asked.\nJim Duffy: That was about repeat purchases.\nDavid Powers: Oh, yeah. I think what we're seeing is that the repeat purchases are happening a little bit faster than we originally thought. And so, we're getting new consumers into the brand through our DTC channels. But I think, with the new product launches and some of the new extensions that we're seeing, we're starting to get people who are buying more products more often. There's a bit of a cult following for the brand, if you can't tell. As soon as something goes up on the website that's new, new launches or new styles, people are just grabbing them. So, it's a combination of repeat purchase on core styles that people are replenishing on. But also, when we want something new, the tribe that's following the brand is jumping on those as well.\nJim Duffy: And, Dave, when you think about the competitive set in the marketplace as a whole, how do you think \u2013 what's the framework to think about how big this brand could become over time?\nDavid Powers: I've always said I could see a path to $0.5 billion for this brand. I think that the real opportunity is probably bigger than that. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we are thinking big with HOKA and we see this as a game changer for Deckers long-term. So, it's exciting to see the acceleration of the business, the adoption of the business globally in all channels, the innovation engine is strong, the marketing tactics are working very well, the tight and controlled distribution is driving high full price selling. So, there is a lot there. The momentum and the conversation and the buzz about the HOKA brand is improving. And it just gives us confidence that we can reach some of those aspirational goals in the next three to five years. Hard to put a number on it right now, but I think if look at HOKA in the context of some of the other running brands out there, the runway is pretty significant for us.\nJim Duffy: Great. Thanks for that perspective.\nDavid Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead with your questions.\nMitch Kummetz: Yes. Thanks for taking my comments. I've got three. Let me just follow-up where Jim left off. I know you don't want to necessarily say HOKA is going to be [500] three to five years or whatever it is. but is there any way you can kind of address where the lowest-hanging fruit is in terms of maybe product categories or distributional or regions to go from where you are today to a number \u2013 to what you think it could be in three to five years. Where is the path of least resistance, I suppose?\nDavid Powers: Well, there's still opportunity \u2013 and it's a good question. There's still opportunity in existing channel, particularly international. We're still opening up additional accounts international and penetrating those doors at a deeper level, is one area. The same within e-commerce international. We're still setting up the mechanics of some of our sites on the international level. But if we take the playbook that's been incorporated with regards to e-commerce, I think there is a substantial amount of international growth coming out of e-commerce, just elevating awareness in the markets for wholesale. So, without even adding any additional distribution points, there is substantial growth.I think, over time, there could be expanded distribution to reach new consumers as we get into accelerating the outdoor, hiking and trail business. There's other categories that we think we could explore over time. And then, also reaching the younger consumer. I think if you look at all those components on a global scale and you think about places like China and Japan down the road, that's where a lot of the growth would come from.We have two key franchises that are driving the majority of the business now, which is the Bondi and the Clifton, as you know. But some of the new launches, like the Carbon X, the Sky collection in hiking, the Rincon, those are starting to gain traction in new distribution points, which will add to the Clifton and the Bondi franchise over time.\nMitch Kummetz: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for the color. And then, Steve, on the gross margin guidance for the year, I think you effectively raised. I think you took out the low end of the range. I believe you said that Q1 gross margin was on plan. I'm just wondering if you change any assumptions, particularly for the fall holiday season. I know you talked about some challenges \u2013 year-over-year challenges on the gross margin line in terms of the favorable environment last year and I'm just wondering if you kept those assumptions or if anything has changed in terms of your thinking?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. So, I think what we're \u2013 you're right, Mitch. What we've done is we've basically taken out the low-end. So, guiding gross margins to the 15.5% kind of more firmly. And the pickup there is the brand mix that we're seeing, contributing to lift in the gross margin. So, with the success that we're seeing with HOKA and the increase that we've now projected for the HOKA business for the full year, that's what lifting that low-end of the margin kind of often giving us more confidence at that high end.\nDavid Powers: [indiscernible].\nMitch Kummetz: And then, my last question, just on sandals, I know it was a bit of a challenge on the UGG side because of the weather, but it didn't sound like there were any issues with Teva and Sanuk, which I think of being more sandal oriented brands for you guys. I was hoping you might just be able to provide some color on that.\nDavid Powers: I think there was a little bit of softness earlier on. Teva is also seeing great success in some of the core franchise styles. The originals collection is still very strong. It has kind of weathered the weather issue better.Sanuk, overall, performing, but the continued decline of the yoga sling franchise for that brand is where we saw the biggest hit.\nMitch Kummetz: Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, Mitch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Svezia from Wedbush. Please go ahead with your question.\nChristopher Svezia: Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarter. My first question, just on the \u2013 on DTC comp, up 15%. That's pretty impressive. Any color you can provide? You said domestic was a big driver to that. Just between digital and physical stores. And, obviously, what's the outlook for the balance of the year? I think you pointed to flat to up low single. I'm just curios, given Q1's performance, any change in your thought process to the year?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Good question. Yeah, you're right, Chris. Really strong comp on the quarter. Where we saw success was domestic. I think a lot of that was being driven online. We don't break it out. But, clearly, our online performance well ahead of our expectation, which really kind of drove the overperformance. Kind of as we look at it, where we really were above expectation was kind of domestic and then a very strong online performance.As we you look kind of at the balance of the year from a guidance perspective, we are looking at kind of positive low single to positive mid-single digit type comp numbers. Still a big part of the season to come. So, clearly, confidence with what we've picked up in first quarter, but again our first quarter is our smallest quarter. So, I think it's a good signal for us going into the year, but we still have our biggest quarters ahead of us. Again, I think what we saw in Q1, especially domestic, especially with what we saw online, confidence going into the rest of the year.\nDavid Powers: This is Dave. I think it also forces the conversation about how do we learn from them and leverage those results for the rest of the year globally, particularly in e-commerce. We talked about the new \u2013 amount of new consumers coming to the brand for both UGG and HOKA online. The performance marketing capabilities that we've developed in this region, which we're taking global, are working extremely well. The PR tactics that the brands are employing and the storytelling with powerful launches and collabs, those are all driving top of funnel awareness, which is resulting in strong interest in traffic to the website. We now need to leverage those learnings to drive traffic to the stores and that's something the teams are focusing on.\nChristopher Svezia: And, Dave, just to follow-up on that, I know things like [indiscernible] driving demand. [indiscernible] last year. I'm just curious, are you learning more from that, is that accelerating, is that contributing at all to the acceleration on the digital side?\nDavid Powers: I think we're pleased with it. It's still a small piece of the total business, but it is helpful for the younger consumer as they come to our site, especially with a brand like UGG, with the average price point of that product. So, early days, but I think the teams have done a great job of making our shopping experience simple for the consumer no matter where they're coming from and how they want to pay. And I think what we're really excited also is the loyalty program, our rewards and the amount of business that that's driving. And it was about 40% of total business in the quarter for UGG came from loyalty consumers versus last year about 25%. So, that's again something that we want to continue to build on and leverage our omni-channel capabilities across stores and online to build that because the lifetime value of those consumers is very strong. They spend more money. Their average transaction is higher. They come to the brand more often. We're looking at how we can leverage that on a global scale and potentially also for HOKA brand.\nChristopher Svezia: Okay. And just finally, just on [indiscernible] gross margin, you did nicely in Q1. The guidance assumes down around 100 basis points or so. I know Q2 last year, there was some freight expense. I'm just curious, how do we think about \u2013 pretty consistent or is one quarter maybe a little heavy under pressure than others. Any color about that would be helpful? Thanks.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I think as we look at it, we are, as you mentioned, kind of guiding the year down. You're right, Q2 does incorporate some freight. We are using freight this year. So, we do expect to see some impact of that in Q2. Really, as we look at the rest of the year, I think it's pretty consistent in terms of our kind of lower expectations, so that bringing it down 100 basis points, I would say pretty consistent as you look at the back half of the year.Again, just some background on that, we do have a higher assumption around using air freight, primarily Q2, and then to some of our estimates around how the promotional environment potentially plays out in kind of Q3, Q4. Hence the kind of the take down in the back of the year. And then, we'll also have some FX headwinds as I mentioned that we have unhedged amounts still out there still dependent on \u2013 reflecting the current rates that we currently have. We have a little bit of an impact as well in the back half.\nChristopher Svezia: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. All the best.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steven Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just mentioned, we are encouraged with our start to the year and now I would like to take you through our first quarter financial results, then provide details on our outlook for the second quarter and updated full fiscal year 2020.Please note that, throughout this discussion, I refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures for comparable prior-year results. Where I refer to these non-GAAP financial measures, I'm referring to results before taking into account non-recurring charges that our management believes are not core to our ongoing operating results.Also note, our non-GAAP results are not adjusted for constant currency with the exception of our direct-to-consumer comparable sales.While we did not have any non-GAAP financial adjustments for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a reconciliation between our reported GAAP and non-GAAP results for the prior-year can be found in our earnings release that is posted on our website under the Investors tab.Now to our results. For the first quarter, revenue was $277 million, up 10% to last year and above our high guidance of $260 million. Compared to our guidance, approximately $7 million of the revenue upside was related to timing of UGG brand shipments, approximately $3 million was from stronger UGG DTC performance and the majority of the remaining balance was driven by outperformance with the HOKA brand.More specifically, UGG timing upside was from early shipment of wholesale orders globally that were originally anticipated for the second quarter. The stronger UGG DTC performance was driven by strong adoption of spring summer styles led by our fluff franchise.And the strength of our HOKA brand was driven by the Clifton 6 introduction and bolstered by the launch of Carbon X.As we look at the first quarter, we are very pleased to see success with these drivers of the business as we continue to shift business to spring summer quarters. Not only through the diversification of the UGG offering, but also through the accelerated growth of the HOKA brand, which has a much more balanced distribution across all four quarters.In comparison to last year, the revenue increase was predominantly HOKA, which benefited from the new styles such as the Carbon X and the newly redesigned Clifton 6.Gross margins were up 109 basis points over last year, to 47% and in line with expectation. The main drivers of the year-over-year increase were favorable mix of brand revenue, gross margin rate expansion, fewer closeout sales, with gains partially offset by channel mix as well as currency headwinds.To provide more detail, the favorable mix of brand revenue and the gross margin rate expansion was driven by HOKA, which carries a higher gross margin than other brands in the first quarter due to seasonality.At the same time, it is experiencing successful full price selling of core product and offerings within our category extensions.Related to the improvements in closeouts, we have improved our distribution model and have become less reliant on closeout volume in the first quarter, primarily driven by the UGG brand as we have shifted our focus to selling more season appropriate styles in the period.Moving to SG&A, our dollar spend was $161.4 million, up 4.6% from last year's GAAP SG&A spend of $154.4 million and up 4.9% to last year's non-GAAP SG&A spend of $153.9 million. The increase in the prior-year in SG&A was driven by incremental marketing spend of approximately $6 million.In comparison to implied guidance, we experienced savings in the first quarter largely coming from reduced marketing originally intended for the first quarter as we saw opportunity to move this spend to later in the year with positive organic search trends tracking in the first quarter and favorable payroll costs as we experienced deferred hiring of certain headcount.During the quarter, we also received a tax refund. More specifically, we finalized a settlement related to prior years. As a result of the settlement and receiving the refund in the quarter, we recognize the full amount in Q1.While we expected to receive payment this year and our guidance for the year assumed this, we were uncertain of the timing and therefore it was factored into the rate for the full year and spread across the year.This all resulted in a loss per share that came in at $0.67 compared to last year's GAAP loss of $1 and last year's non-GAAP loss of $0.98. This also compares to a guidance range of a loss of a $1.25 to a loss of $1.15.The $0.48 beat to our high guidance of loss per share came from approximately $0.14 from the tax refund recorded in the quarter, $0.10 from earlier shipment of UGG wholesale orders, $0.10 from increased performance in the HOKA brand, $0.10 from operating expense savings driven by the delayed hiring as well as marketing spend that is now planned and moved later in the year, and $0.05 from stronger of UGG DTC performance.Our balance sheet at June 30 remains strong as cash and equivalents were $503 million, up from $418 million at June 30 of last year.Inventory was up 9% to $473 million from $436 million at the same time last year. And similar to last year, we had no material short-term borrowings under our credit lines.During the quarter, we repurchased 227,000 shares of the company's common stock at an average price of $154.36 for a total of $35 million. As of June 30, 2019, $315 million remains available under our share repurchase authorization.Now, moving on to our outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.When combined with our first quarter performance, this outlook provides a strong first half expectation for fiscal 2020, including revenue growth for the first half of roughly 5% to 6.5% when compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the range of $0.08 to $0.18, representing approximately 6% to 13% growth versus the first half of last year.As we have now completed our US distribution center consolidation, I think it is important to note that we have planned for a more level loaded quarter-end. As a result, we anticipated that some UGG product that has traditionally shipped in the final week of Q2 will now ship in Q3 as we ramp up our first year and we create more efficiencies with our distribution operations.Now, for our full fiscal year 2020, we are raising our guidance to account for the better-than-expected performance in Q1. The upside we are flowing through to the full-year guidance equates to $0.20 in earnings per share.Our updated full-year guidance includes raising our revenue expectation to the range of $2.1 billion to $2.125 billion, with recognition that our outlook for the HOKA brand has been lifted, now assuming sales are growing in the high 30% range for the year, partially offset by reductions in the Sanuk domestic wholesale business related to the decision to eliminate distribution in the warehouse channel.And upside in the UGG business that we saw in Q1 is now projected to be offset by currency headwinds in the rest of the year.Gross margins are expected to be approximately 50.5%, SG&A at or slightly better than 36% as we defer a portion of our first quarter savings to marketing efforts and technology investments later in the year, all generating an operating margin of approximately 14.5%.Also, based on an updated view on tax, we now expect our rate to be 20.5% for the full fiscal year. These updates, combined with the share repurchase executed in the first quarter, we are raising our earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 now to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.60 on a share count of approximately 29.4 million shares.This $0.20 raise in earnings per share guidance for the full year is being driven by approximately $0.06 from the net impact of the revised revenue expectation driven by the full year increase in HOKA projections, partially offset by the strategic reset in Sanuk; $0.06 from operating expense savings from the first quarter; $0.05 from the better tax rate, now reflecting an estimated 20.5% for the full year effective tax rate; and $0.03 from the recent share repurchase activity in the first quarter.Our guidance for the second quarter in fiscal year 2020 excludes any potential non-GAAP charges as well as the effect of any future share repurchase.Recognizing there have been recent movements in foreign currency exchange rates, we are partially hedged for our exposure in this fiscal year and our updated guidance incorporates the impact of our exposure on any unhedged amounts.We believe that the year-over-year impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation remains at approximately a 40 basis point headwind on our margins.On tariffs, we continue to monitor tariff policy decisions closely and still do not anticipate any financial impact related to the recently imposed tariffs.As a reminder, we have stated that less than 20% of our current global production is created in China and shipped to the United States.To further mitigate current risk of exposure to potential new tariffs on China imports, we have taken the opportunity to receive some inventory ahead of the normal cadence, which is partially contributing to the 9% increase in our total inventory balance at June 30, 2019 as compared to levels at the same point last year.With that, I'll now turn it back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yeah. Good question, Jon. We really aren't changing the UGG. So, kind of positive low single-digits is what the guidance is for the year related the UGG brand. No change there. There is a significant change in HOKA. So, I think before we were in the mid-20 range and we're now in the higher 30% range. So, that's where you're seeing an uptake on HOKA, but it is being offset by the Sanuk takeback as we pulled out of that warehouse channel. But, net-net, still an increase on the full year revenue number. Yeah. So, it is up a little bit. You're right. We saw tremendous growth in the current quarter. That's the 69% that we're talking about, so well ahead. As we get into later quarters in the year, those are bigger historic quarters for HOKA. So, that's why the growth rate will drop a little bit on a percentage term. Sure, Kelly. What we have is we'll have the UGG business compared to last year down just a little bit, and that's really that shifting into Q3. So, we did bring kind of $10 million forward into Q1 and then we'll have a little bit going out on the back end from Q2 to Q3. So, that's the, call it, down kind of low-single digits. Yeah. So, the margins on HOKA, as we've kind of said, are very similar to UGG in the channel, so in wholesale similar channels, in DTC similar margins. So, very strong margins. As we indicated on the prepared remarks, what's also helping drive some of the HOKA is less closeout that we're seeing. And so, we can continue to kind of drive that full price selling. It was a very clean quarter. So, I don't know how much more upside there is kind of on the surface within channel. Clearly, there's upside as we drive more DTC business with the HOKA business. So, from a channel mix, there's more opportunity as we make our DTC business with HOKA bigger. Yeah. I would say on that, just what we observed is kind of that normal cadence. We definitely see a pickup in the latter half of the quarter. I think as we saw kind of within the industry, there was some softness with the industry. I think we saw strength with UGG and a normal cadence within the quarter and a normal cadence of the business picking up kind of later in the quarter. Yeah. Sam, breaking out the channel outperformance, we'll let that come out in the Q. But good, I would say. From the numbers that we've reflected, kind of, clearly, HOKA very strong wholesale performance globally. So, not only North America business, very strong HOKA performance really across the globe.I think from a wholesale perspective on UGG, we saw strong performance domestically in the wholesale channel and internationally kind of more to expectation. But that's on the international front as we indicated in the prepared remarks, kind of more where we saw some early shipments. But, again, from a global perspective, if you take out the early shipments, wholesale performed pretty much to kind of what we expected with a little bit of overperformance in our DTC channel related to UGG in North America. About $4 million shift. Yeah, that's about right. Yeah. I think that's fair. Yeah. Flat with the shift. Yeah. So, I think what we're \u2013 you're right, Mitch. What we've done is we've basically taken out the low-end. So, guiding gross margins to the 15.5% kind of more firmly. And the pickup there is the brand mix that we're seeing, contributing to lift in the gross margin. So, with the success that we're seeing with HOKA and the increase that we've now projected for the HOKA business for the full year, that's what lifting that low-end of the margin kind of often giving us more confidence at that high end. Yeah. Good question. Yeah, you're right, Chris. Really strong comp on the quarter. Where we saw success was domestic. I think a lot of that was being driven online. We don't break it out. But, clearly, our online performance well ahead of our expectation, which really kind of drove the overperformance. Kind of as we look at it, where we really were above expectation was kind of domestic and then a very strong online performance.As we you look kind of at the balance of the year from a guidance perspective, we are looking at kind of positive low single to positive mid-single digit type comp numbers. Still a big part of the season to come. So, clearly, confidence with what we've picked up in first quarter, but again our first quarter is our smallest quarter. So, I think it's a good signal for us going into the year, but we still have our biggest quarters ahead of us. Again, I think what we saw in Q1, especially domestic, especially with what we saw online, confidence going into the rest of the year. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I think as we look at it, we are, as you mentioned, kind of guiding the year down. You're right, Q2 does incorporate some freight. We are using freight this year. So, we do expect to see some impact of that in Q2. Really, as we look at the rest of the year, I think it's pretty consistent in terms of our kind of lower expectations, so that bringing it down 100 basis points, I would say pretty consistent as you look at the back half of the year.Again, just some background on that, we do have a higher assumption around using air freight, primarily Q2, and then to some of our estimates around how the promotional environment potentially plays out in kind of Q3, Q4. Hence the kind of the take down in the back of the year. And then, we'll also have some FX headwinds as I mentioned that we have unhedged amounts still out there still dependent on \u2013 reflecting the current rates that we currently have. We have a little bit of an impact as well in the back half."

            "name": "David Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone. As shown by the first quarter results posted this afternoon, we are off to a solid start in fiscal year 2020. For the quarter, our portfolio of brands posted gains in revenue as well as earnings versus the prior year with the most material contribution of topline growth coming from HOKA ONE ONE brand as new product launches paired with enhanced marketing activations continued to build brand momentum.In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue was up 10% versus last year to $277 million. We delivered gross margin of 47% and a loss per share of $0.67. These results are above the high end of guidance that we provided for the quarter as we benefited from earlier delivery of wholesale and distributor shipments in the UGG brand and saw continued success in the HOKA brand including the boost from the introduction of the Carbon X.The strength seen in the first quarter provides us with added confidence in achieving our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, which Steve will walk you through later in the call.The results for the quarter are a testament to the work our teams are doing to strengthen our brands by bringing compelling product and experiences to our consumer.As I look at the industry, I see Deckers leading in innovation with two of the most exciting product launches this season in the HOKA Carbon X and the UGG fluff franchise.We're making progress in reshaping our business and I believe our investments in marketing and innovation will continue to push our brand ahead of the competition.I'll now review the highlights from the quarter starting with the fashion lifestyle group. UGG global sales in the first quarter were up 2% over last year to $139 million, driven by high teens increase in domestic sales. The strength of our domestic business was fueled by both wholesale and DTC growth.As was planned, international sales were down versus last year, but we're in the early stages of a marketplace reset in our EMEA region as we better position our brands in the marketplace.As I think about the progress we are making, I'm excited that consumers are finding more to love in the UGG brand's spring and summer offering. This year, we have seen US search interest rise by 50% over last year.In addition, UGG has also seen a significant increase in the key 18 to 34-year-old demographic where the number of online purchases in the quarter grew by 86% versus the previous year.And aligned with our company's initiative around digital growth, UGG Rewards is starting to make a noticeable impact, with nearly 40% of US e-commerce revenue being driven by loyalty customers.From a revenue perspective, UGG gained a significant incremental dollar contribution from the newly introduced fluff collection. Our marketing activations, including a partnership with Born This Way Foundation, help drive excitement around the entire collection of fluff product which we feel is unique to UGG and true to the brand's DNA.The fluff collection is driving incredibly high sell-through rates as well as attracting new consumers to the brand. The collection has been praised by high-end publications and positively endorsed by a number of high profile celebrities. Importantly, brand attention is being gained in the seasonal period in which UGG has traditionally not been top of mind.Partially offsetting the UGG brand's Q1 performance was the soft start to the sandal season as a result of rainy conditions across much of the country early in the quarter. It is also important to note that our strategy of controlling marketplace supply of core product, which is designed to reduce the sales of core product during Q1 in order to drive sales of true spring and summer product, also impacted the brand's top line results.That said, we believe this is an important step towards building a more meaningful spring business for UGG. I'm encouraged by domestic growth and the progress the brand is making towards a healthier mix of product.Just three years ago, more than half of products sold during our first quarter were autumn and winter boots. However, this year, we reduced the mix of boots to less than 40%. On top of that, UGG was once again a top 10 spring brand at Nordstrom, capturing healthy growth versus the prior year and is performing exceptionally well at Nordstrom's anniversary sale.This is further evidence that UGG is able to address counter seasonal demand in the spring and summer timeframe and remains focused on building traction in styles that are incremental to the core offering.Turning to the performance lifestyle group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk.Beginning with HOKA, the brand's investments in product innovation as well as its story sharing philosophy are propelling the brand forward as evidenced by first quarter performance with revenue growth of 69% versus the prior year, with equal strength both domestically and internationally, more than doubling new consumer acquisition versus the prior year and the Carbon X launch which drove nearly 800 million impressions globally and delivered strong sales online, 40% of which were first time DTC purchasers.I'm incredibly proud of the collaborative effort to launch the Carbon X this last May. Carbon X was designed as a limited release that has exceeded sales expectations. Consumers are raving about the experience of the Carbon X as seen by overwhelmingly positive online product reviews.We feel the Carbon X launch event impressions drove serious momentum in brand awareness, leading up to a key release in our Clifton franchise.In June, the brand introduced the Clifton 6, the most innovative update to one of HOKA's core franchises. Despite just one month of availability in the marketplace, the Clifton 6 has driven very high sell-through rates and is ranked as the number one or two shoe of any brand in nearly all US wholesale specialty running accounts.This is a testament to the HOKA team's dedication to franchise management and ability to improve on a popular product through the commitment to innovation.In conjunction with these new product launches, HOKA continues to invest in building awareness. As a result, the brand recently entered a partnership with Lifetime Fitness, creating an authentic engagement opportunity with a potential to attract new consumers into the HOKA ecosystem.HOKA and Lifetime seek to empower people in all aspects of their health journey through numerous activations that showcase real and positive change regardless of size or scale.Shifting to Teva, the brand outperformed our expectations by about $2 million, but declined by 4% versus last year due to the strategic decision to adjust the European wholesale model from direct to distributor.For the quarter, the brand experienced impressive growth in both the Universal and Hurricane franchises.Moving to Sanuk, for the quarter, sales came in approximately $3 million below our expectation, primarily due to the softness in the yoga sling franchise. As we've done over the past two years, we continue to evaluate our distribution opportunities across our entire portfolio of brands.Aligned with the organization's commitment to strong brand management, we've made the strategic decision to exit the warehouse channel with our Sanuk brand.While this decision will have a negative impact on fiscal 2020 revenue, it's the right move for the health of the brand. Moving forward, this provides a better environment for Sanuk to focus on other underpenetrated channels.Moving to channel performance, wholesale increased 11% over last year, driven primarily by domestic expansion of UGG and HOKA. As a note, part of the increased wholesale volume was due to the timing of UGG shipments, which Steve will walk you through later in the call.In total, our domestic wholesale business grew by 15% versus prior year despite this being the first time that we constrained selling of UGG core classic products during the first quarter.Aligned with the strategy, we worked with our wholesale customers to shift the use of open-to-buy dollars for true spring and summer product, while at the same time reducing the amount of closeouts year-over-year.Strength domestically was also driven by HOKA growth as the brand gained market share in existing accounts and experienced increased volume in both the Clifton and Bondi franchises, benefiting from the additional brand attention due to the Carbon X launch in May.Domestic wholesale strength was partially offset by softness in our international UGG business. As we have previously indicated, we continue to see headwinds on the international front for the brand, but are addressing with the learnings we've gained from our implemented distribution strategies in the US market.Our HOKA brand continues to gain momentum within international wholesale as the brand is building important awareness during its early stages of growth outside the US.We are engaging in marketing activities that are impactful on a global scale. Specifically, we are beginning to see the benefits of these marketing activations, including our Carbon X launch and HOKA's sponsorship of ironman events in countries around the world.From a DTC perspective, comparable sales increased 16%, with total direct-to-consumer sales up 10% versus last year's first quarter. This was led by strong performance from our e-commerce channel where both UGG and HOKA contributed materially to the growth and exceeded our expectations. Similar to our wholesale channel, our domestic direct-to-consumer business was the primary driver of growth.Overall, Deckers has delivered another strong performance. Though it remains our smallest quarter, I'm proud of the progress we've made to increase the size of our spring and summer business as we have grown our first quarter revenue by 32% over the past two years.I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance as well as outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Thanks, Steve. While our first quarter exceeded expectations, it remains the smallest period in our fiscal year and there is still heavy lifting ahead of us to meet our objectives for the year.That said, I am excited about the progress we continue to make within the organization as we reinvest in marketing tactics to drive brand heat and awareness, fueling growth within UGG men's, UGG women's non-core and the HOKA, with increases in digital outreach, experiential marketing and event driven spend as we build our technology and tools with added talent that will advance our analytical capabilities and create new ways to connect with consumers and develop incremental opportunities that can add value to our brand portfolio in the future.Going forward, the organization remains dedicated to continuous innovation. Our design, development and innovation teams have been significant contributors in pushing the boundaries of product innovation for Deckers. And we look forward to seeing continued enhancements in the near future.I'd like to thank all of our employees across the Deckers organization for their exceptional efforts in this past quarter and their continued commitment to the successful execution of our strategies.With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. operator? Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. That's a great question. And it's pretty exciting momentum to see the momentum that the team is building in North America, particularly through all of our channels. And what's great about it is we are driving the business through new introductions of spring and summer product. And as you heard on the earnings script, the shift away from reliance on boots in the quarter and the growth coming from new product introductions in seasonally relevant product such as the fluff franchisor, which is a massive success for us, is \u2013 we're learning a lot from that. It's also allowing us to reach new consumers and bring new new consumers and younger consumers into the brand, which is great because they traditionally come in through the classic and then explore more of the brand. But we're seeing a large number of younger consumers coming directly to the brand for the first time, particularly in our DTC channels, purchasing that product that they're wearing in season.So, it gives us a lot of confidence that if we hit the right product design, coupled with the right social and PR strategy and marketing tactics, that we can really move the needle in these categories and in the quarter. It also tells us that big ideas in product, something that is distinctly UGG in DNA and disruptive in the marketplace is a method for us to continue to drive success in new categories.So, we had a fantastic meeting with the UGG product team yesterday and talked about the learnings from fluff here and how we translate that into future seasons across different categories and also into men's. And I think you're going to see more of these more sizable, meaningful launches. Fewer bigger launches is the approach for us going forward. But now that we have the attention of younger consumer and credibility in spring and summer gives us a lot of confidence going forward. And then, we just need to employ the same strategy globally. Yeah. I've always been a fan \u2013 we've always said the money is in the middle. So, it's kind of new innovations that are probably crossovers or hybrids of two categories. So, we'll have limited success and we can be successful in pure sneakers, but I think it's the mashup of sneakers and sandals, so you can provide the comfort with the UGG DNA. That's something that's unique that nobody else can do. I think that's where the strength of our brand is. And we have quite a few products within that coming out of our innovation team and our design team.It's interesting. This fluff product is \u2013 in our P&L, it's classified as a slipper, but the consumer sees it as a sandal. And so, I think that tells you that it has broader shoulders and it's very disruptive and interesting, and it's something that nobody else can do. And I think that's the formula going forward. Okay. Thanks, Jon. Kelly, this is Dave. I think what you're seeing this quarter is very little increased distribution over last year. We spent the last three years or so in incubating new distributions such as Macy's and Urban Outfitters and Foot Locker and a couple of smaller kind of boutiques, in addition to the important department stores. And we've actually closed more accounts than we've opened. So, what we've been doing is consolidating, elevating to the key players in the industry. And so , the majority of the growth you're seeing now is increased door count within those channels or within those stores \u2013 or chains, I should say, sorry. Burt just better penetration and sell-through across the board. So, we're seeing it both in wholesale with those accounts and also in our DTC channel. Yeah. Help me out a little bit. What are you looking for in terms of...? Yeah. I think, interestingly, the months were pretty steady. They were strong from the get-go and the beginning of the quarter. In HOKA, it was really ignited by the launch of the Carbon X and the PR and the press and the buzz that the brand got from that launch. And then, when we officially launched Clifton 6, that maintained the momentum. So, that's been pretty steady through the quarter. UGG was a little bit softer in the beginning due to some of the sandal challenges, but that was offset by the fluffy ad [ph] franchise and that's continued to be strong through the quarter. So, they were pretty steady all along. The men's business is still small in Q4 and Q1 for that gender. The strength of men's, where we're really seeing the growth is coming in in Q2 and Q3, really driven by the new mail franchise. So, we had some good product launches in sneakers and shoes, but they weren't enough to really move the needle in men's. So, we have work to do, an opportunity, I would say, for men's in that time of year. And we had a good meeting on that yesterday and some of the learnings that we're taking from women's in the fluff franchise and other categories and translating that into men's for spring and summer. But the real strength of men's, where we're seeing the growth, is definitely in fall winter through the new mail and with the boot category at this point. You bet. Yeah. So, it's a good question. I think one of the things that we're seeing, right, and it's a little bit harder for us to just predict is that, as inventory channels \u2013 they were clean last year, they're even cleaner this year. What we're seeing is, with the success of UGG, that retailers are asking for product earlier because they want to make sure that they have the product. And so, that's where we're seeing the shift. It's good indication of the strength and health of the brand, but it's hard to know exactly. One, they're seeing strong sell-through. They also want to make sure that they're getting product for the fall sell-out. So, that's where we're seeing kind of people taking it earlier this year than where they have, say, a year or two ago. And we'll fulfill it. Like we've said, we will guide and project to kind of what we see on the order book. But also, if a customer is asking for a product sooner than that, we'll be ready to deliver it.And then, just to note, really kind of on the shift out of Q2 to Q3, that's us being a little bit conservative with the first year of our consolidated DC. A year ago, we looked at really the last week and there is a lot of activity that goes out that last week of the quarter. So, as we have consolidated our DC, we were pushing a little bit of that out into Q3. Now, we may get orders where customers want a little bit sooner, but we want to balance out that load because it's a big load in that final week. And so, we want to be mindful of what our capacity is and kind of constraints with the new consolidated DC. I think it's $3 million to $4 million on that shift. Yeah, that's correct. Maybe a little bit of both. I think it was the right call. It allows the European teams to focus on our core businesses and then have somebody who is strong in the region focus on expanding the Teva business in a local way. We'll continue to evaluate it over time, but I think it was the right thing as we were looking at profit improvements and focus on the organization. It's great to see that the distributors managing the business so well, which means the teams are working closely with those partners and they have the expertise required. So, I would say it was the right call. We're pleased with how it's going. And it gives us an opportunity to reevaluate down the road. Thanks, Sam. No, flattish. So, kind of same as what we've said before. We don't see much change there, but significant growth. So, kind of up mid 50% range is kind of how we're looking at that. Yeah, Q1 is really not a Koolaburra quarter. You'll start to see that really ramp up. Thanks, Tom. Yeah. I think it's safe to say the awareness is increasing. I think the last time we looked at it, North America was roughly around the 12%. I don't have the exact figures in front of me, but it's definitely improving. And I think you're seeing that as resulting in the sales. The top of funnel exercises that the team have been doing, particularly the Carbon X event, which was a massive success, the way the team has pulled that off with breaking two world records in an event, that was resonating on a global scale and launching a brand-new innovative product. That brought 800 million and growing, I should say, still improving impression to the brand on a global level. So, the awareness is improving.The average age, it's a little bit older than we would like, I think, and so there's opportunity to target younger consumers through some of our marketing tactics. I just had a conversation with a brand on that yesterday. But it's also a higher price point product. So, we need to make sure that we're balancing out the high level of our performance and technical characteristics of that product and price point with shoes like the Rincon which we just launched which is a little bit more affordable price point, little bit more for an everyday runner.And I forget, what was the third point you just asked. Oh, yeah. I think what we're seeing is that the repeat purchases are happening a little bit faster than we originally thought. And so, we're getting new consumers into the brand through our DTC channels. But I think, with the new product launches and some of the new extensions that we're seeing, we're starting to get people who are buying more products more often. There's a bit of a cult following for the brand, if you can't tell. As soon as something goes up on the website that's new, new launches or new styles, people are just grabbing them. So, it's a combination of repeat purchase on core styles that people are replenishing on. But also, when we want something new, the tribe that's following the brand is jumping on those as well. I've always said I could see a path to $0.5 billion for this brand. I think that the real opportunity is probably bigger than that. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we are thinking big with HOKA and we see this as a game changer for Deckers long-term. So, it's exciting to see the acceleration of the business, the adoption of the business globally in all channels, the innovation engine is strong, the marketing tactics are working very well, the tight and controlled distribution is driving high full price selling. So, there is a lot there. The momentum and the conversation and the buzz about the HOKA brand is improving. And it just gives us confidence that we can reach some of those aspirational goals in the next three to five years. Hard to put a number on it right now, but I think if look at HOKA in the context of some of the other running brands out there, the runway is pretty significant for us. Thank you. Well, there's still opportunity \u2013 and it's a good question. There's still opportunity in existing channel, particularly international. We're still opening up additional accounts international and penetrating those doors at a deeper level, is one area. The same within e-commerce international. We're still setting up the mechanics of some of our sites on the international level. But if we take the playbook that's been incorporated with regards to e-commerce, I think there is a substantial amount of international growth coming out of e-commerce, just elevating awareness in the markets for wholesale. So, without even adding any additional distribution points, there is substantial growth.I think, over time, there could be expanded distribution to reach new consumers as we get into accelerating the outdoor, hiking and trail business. There's other categories that we think we could explore over time. And then, also reaching the younger consumer. I think if you look at all those components on a global scale and you think about places like China and Japan down the road, that's where a lot of the growth would come from.We have two key franchises that are driving the majority of the business now, which is the Bondi and the Clifton, as you know. But some of the new launches, like the Carbon X, the Sky collection in hiking, the Rincon, those are starting to gain traction in new distribution points, which will add to the Clifton and the Bondi franchise over time. [indiscernible]. I think there was a little bit of softness earlier on. Teva is also seeing great success in some of the core franchise styles. The originals collection is still very strong. It has kind of weathered the weather issue better.Sanuk, overall, performing, but the continued decline of the yoga sling franchise for that brand is where we saw the biggest hit. Thanks, Mitch. This is Dave. I think it also forces the conversation about how do we learn from them and leverage those results for the rest of the year globally, particularly in e-commerce. We talked about the new \u2013 amount of new consumers coming to the brand for both UGG and HOKA online. The performance marketing capabilities that we've developed in this region, which we're taking global, are working extremely well. The PR tactics that the brands are employing and the storytelling with powerful launches and collabs, those are all driving top of funnel awareness, which is resulting in strong interest in traffic to the website. We now need to leverage those learnings to drive traffic to the stores and that's something the teams are focusing on. I think we're pleased with it. It's still a small piece of the total business, but it is helpful for the younger consumer as they come to our site, especially with a brand like UGG, with the average price point of that product. So, early days, but I think the teams have done a great job of making our shopping experience simple for the consumer no matter where they're coming from and how they want to pay. And I think what we're really excited also is the loyalty program, our rewards and the amount of business that that's driving. And it was about 40% of total business in the quarter for UGG came from loyalty consumers versus last year about 25%. So, that's again something that we want to continue to build on and leverage our omni-channel capabilities across stores and online to build that because the lifetime value of those consumers is very strong. They spend more money. Their average transaction is higher. They come to the brand more often. We're looking at how we can leverage that on a global scale and potentially also for HOKA brand. Thanks, Chris."

Before diving into the business, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for the progress towards ending the pandemic\u2019s toll in the United States. However, countries around the world are still struggling with dangerous outbreaks. Many of our employees have friends and family members that are currently being impacted by the devastating COVID-19 surge within India, Nepal and other South Asian countries. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected by this pandemic over the past year and a half, and on behalf of Deckers, I wish for everyone\u2019s health and safety moving forward. As I reflect on this past year, I am continually impressed by the tenacity and resiliency of the Deckers organization, and the dedication demonstrated by our teams as they continued to deliver exceptional results. FY 2021 results were driven by the exceptional brand and marketplace management of our leaders, but also by the global operations, retail and supply chain teams, who allowed us to fulfill the demand for our brands. By continuing to be aggressive with HOKA globally and capturing the opportunity in UGG, we were able to exceed expectations in a challenging environment and have accelerated the pace of growth for our brands. Today, I am excited to share the results of a record breaking year for Deckers. We saw a strong finish to fiscal 2021, with full year revenue increasing 19% versus last year to over $2.5 billion and earnings per share increasing 40% to $13.47. FY 2021 performance was driven by expanded awareness and adoption of HOKA around the world, as more consumers experienced the benefits of the brand\u2019s innovative products, consumer actively seeking UGG for its unique combination of fashion appeal and the unmistakable feeling of the brand, best-in-class e-commerce capabilities that enabled consumer acquisition in a disrupted physical retail environment, strategic prioritization of brand strength and demand creation through disciplined marketplace management and the grit of our employees who overcame significant macro challenges and operational pressures to deliver exceptional results. Many of these items that drove performance during the year were the results of our long-term strategies that remain top of mind as we transition into fiscal 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, these include accelerating consumer adoption of the HOKA brand globally, building UGG as a year-round global lifestyle brand through a diverse product offering, executing our digital first approach by growing direct-to-consumer acquisition and retention online with a specific focus on gaining closet space with 18 year-old to 34 year-old consumers, tailoring distribution strategies unique to each of our brands in order to properly balance brand health in conjunction with sustainable growth, which includes the recent reset activities for the UGG brand internationally and focusing spend behind these key initiatives to drive optimal returns on investment, while maintaining top tier levels of profitability. While we believe that remaining committed to our long-term strategies was the primary enabler of our success this year, Deckers also uniquely benefited from certain circumstances resulting from the pandemic. Fiscal 2021 revenue exceeded our pre-pandemic expectations as we saw an acceleration of certain growth opportunities. With brands scaling faster than previously anticipated, we now need to accelerate critical investments to scale our supply chain and logistics infrastructure, as well as bolster our teams with additional talent to prepare for emerging opportunities. Fiscal 2022 will be another positive step in the evolution of Deckers Brands, as we strategically invest behind core infrastructure needs and seed opportunities that will enable sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth. Over the long-term, we\u2019re investing in major drivers of our business, including building HOKA to $1 billion plus global performance brand that represents a significant portion of total company revenue, driving our direct-to-consumer business towards 50% of our global revenues, scaling international markets across brands and seeding opportunities beyond footwear. Steve will provide more details on these investments, as well as our forward looking revenue and margin expectations later in the call. In the meantime, I will share some details around fiscal 2021 performance at the brand and channel levels, as well as provide some context around fiscal 2022 building blocks. Starting with the brand highlights, global UGG fiscal 2021 revenue increased 13% versus last year to $1.717 billion. The brand\u2019s success in FY 2021 was primarily due to U.S. consumers actively seeking UGG products all year long with search interest increasing 27% over fiscal 2020 according to Google Trends, which led to accelerated consumer acquisition online as the brand added over 2.5 million new consumers to its global e-commerce database and captured the critical 18-year to 34-year aged consumer in the U.S., which increased 83% to the elevated fashion appeal to brand. And lastly, more consumers purchased multiple UGG products than ever before, as the brand saw an 85% increase in consumers purchasing two of our products during the year. We believe much of the brand heat that created momentum for UGG in the U.S. resulted from the brand\u2019s strategically managed distribution network, authentic PR activations, fashion collaborations, targeted digital marketing and a compelling product offering that has expanded the fashion relevance of UGG brand DNA across new categories. As evidence of the UGG brand\u2019s success with a diversified assortment, fiscal 2021 product performance was driven by the expansion of the Fluff franchise, as the brand drove demand to both the original Fluff Yeah, as well as complementary styles with similar slipper-sandal hybrid attributes, increased adoption of the New Male franchise among men, women and kids, the introduction of the Ultra Mini and Classic Clear boots, which were particularly popular with younger consumers, development of the Tasman into a fashion slipper sneaker, as UGG featured the style in a number of recent collaborations, helping to raise the hybrid style\u2019s profile, the brand\u2019s first ever ready-to-wear apparel collection, which featured fashionable sportswear and outerwear pieces and Heritage slippers having greater year round relevancy as many people were working from home and seeking the comfort of what we refer to as the feeling of UGG. These styles that drove UGG growth this year made up the majority of both the brand\u2019s top 10 styles purchased by acquired consumers, as well as the top 10 styles purchased by consumers 18 years old to 34 years old. While women remain the primary purchasers of UGG products, the brand\u2019s mix of gender continues to shift towards men\u2019s and kid\u2019s products. Part of this shift is due to many consumers purchasing UGG for the whole family. In the U.S., as compared to last year, UGG experienced an 88% increase in DTC revenue from orders containing both men\u2019s and women\u2019s products, and 117% increase in orders containing both kid\u2019s and women\u2019s products. With more purchasing for the whole family, both men\u2019s and kid\u2019s footwear increased as a percentage of total UGG brand business. While the U.S. has been driving UGG category diversification over the past few years, we have been encouraged by the adoption of new categories within international regions over the last year as well. Such is the Ultra Mini which was a top five style in its introductory season, the Classic Clear which was ranked second new style in terms of dollar volume, Fluff franchise volume was 2.5 times larger than last year, and sneakers were standout in our Asia-Pacific region. Improvements in new category adoption are largely attributable to localized marketing activations meant to build UGG brand heat internationally and attracting younger consumers to the brand. Our targeted digital marketing efforts are paying off, as UGG experienced a significant increase in e-commerce traffic from visitors aged 18 to 34 in both the U.K. and China during FY 2021. These early indicators of success and our plan to further invest behind localized marketing tactics give us confidence that UGG will rebound and return to growth in the brand\u2019s international markets during fiscal 2022. UGG has a difficult task ahead in lapping a record year, where we benefited from the pandemic driving greater attention to the brand. However, with our planned investments and demand creation, we have confidence the brand can drive topline revenue growth in fiscal 2022 by fulfilling wholesale demand as we reset the marketplace with filling product and satisfy some of the missed opportunities in fiscal 2021 during inventory shortages, maintaining momentum with the younger consumers around the world and driving repeat purchases from consumers new to the brand in FY 2021, recovering lost volume in EMEA with the goal of lapping fiscal 2020 revenues and maximizing demand captured through DTC, increasing local investments in China to elevate the brand and accelerate revenue growth, all while working to lap growth on heritage slipper products that benefited from the pandemic. Shifting your attention to HOKA, global revenue in fiscal 2021 increased 62% versus last year to $571 million. The growth of HOKA over the past year was a testament to the brand\u2019s methodical approach to managing a consistent brand message and introducing innovative products that resonate across the global distribution landscape. HOKA continues to exhibit balanced growth across its ecosystem of access points with every region and channel distribution increasing volume above last year. The increasing scale of HOKA is undeniably impressive. But even more importantly, the brand is growing in the right way and making meaningful progress towards strategic initiates. In a year of uncertainty, HOKA initially doubled down on key franchises, with the goal of amplifying hero styles to bring new consumers to the brand. As these styles drove consumer acquisition, HOKA was successful in driving more repeat purchases in alternate products. This is the result of the HOKA team\u2019s development of innovative products, built for speed such as the Carbon X2 and Mach 4, the outdoors with the Speedgoat and Challenger for trail running and the Kaha for hiking and recovery featuring the Ora Flip Flops and Slides. In addition to providing great product for all athletes, HOKA has also created meaningful partnerships to build the lifestyle relevance of its performance products. One such partnership includes the brand\u2019s recent launch with Free People, which helps expose HOKA products to consumers who may not otherwise discover their brand. This is not meant to signal a shift towards fashion for the HOKA brand, but rather the brand embracing the fashionable attributes of its performance products and gaining an audience of younger consumers. In addition to targeting youth wholesale distribution, the HOKA DTC team prioritize digital spend on platforms where younger consumers are spending time and discovering brands online. The brand has also been working to create a seamless replenishment experience for consumers who may have discovered HOKA elsewhere. Through these efforts, HOKA was able to increase 18 to 34-year-old consumer acquisition online by 156% as compared to last year. We believe the HOKA brand\u2019s commitment to building a more diverse outdoor community by including underrepresented groups in 60% of marketing content is resonating well with younger consumers. HOKA is winning with the combination of disrupted product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing and a consistent consumer experience based on the quality of the brand\u2019s products and ecosystem of access points. From a regional standpoint, both domestic and international posted impressive gains in fiscal 2021, but the international revenue growth rate was able to outpace domestic up a lower base. As we\u2019ve spoken about in prior earnings calls, the mix of international unit to the global total continues to move towards the 50-50 split, but revenue is more favored towards domestic because of the use of distributors internationally. In FY 2021, distributors drove the largest proportion of international HOKA revenue growth, greater than both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. We see this as both a positive reflection of HOKA distributor\u2019s ability to scale the brand as well as an opportunity for global growth as we continue to strategically evolve our distribution of the brand around the world. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we anticipate HOKA growth will continue at a rapid pace driven by acquiring new consumers by building brand awareness, retaining existing consumers with product and category innovation, gaining market share with wholesale partners, building global brand presence through a return of in-person event sponsorship, focusing on key markets in Europe such as Germany and the U.K., and increasing the frequency of product drops to maintain excitement with consumers. In addition, as we invest to the longer term, we are earmarking investment in China for the HOKA brand to build a meaningful presence in that region. This includes building a team local to the market and creating a retail presence to the HOKA brand. Turning to Teva, despite relatively flat revenue of $139 million, Teva made productive strides towards the future as the brand invested behind the universal franchise, which experienced strong growth versus last year, increased the penetration of DTC to the total brand by 10 percentage points, nearly doubled direct-to-consumer acquisition year-over-year, strengthened partnerships with strategic wholesale accounts, contributed incremental profitability to Deckers bottomline and made further enhancement towards sustainability goals. Looking ahead, Teva is focused on being a leader in sustainability, building year-round innovative product for the modern outdoor consumer, taking market share in the closed-toe space with the brand\u2019s Ember franchise, building on DTC consumer acquisition and maintaining a high proportion of 18-year-old to 34-year-old consumers. Moving to Koolaburra, global revenue in fiscal 2021 increased 9% versus last year to $76 million. Performance this year was influenced by conservative ordering at the onset of the pandemic, as we chose to reduce inventory purchases in strategic areas of the brand portfolio. Based on high levels of consumer demand, Koolaburra experienced both topline revenue growth and record profitability, despite scarce product availability and disruptions in the wholesale family value channel. For the year ahead, we expect Koolaburra to continue building market share with existing wholesale partners through door count expansion, build on the direct-to-consumer momentum experienced in fiscal 2021 as the brand more than doubled consumer acquisition compared to the prior year, further diversified the assortment through the growth of men\u2019s product and women\u2019s non-boot categories which experienced outsized growth this year and expand the brand\u2019s lifestyle appeal through license opportunities with new product adjacencies. And finally, Sanuk revenue in fiscal 2021 declined to $42 million. Over the last year, the Sanuk team made great progress to right-size the brand\u2019s distribution, focusing on wholesale channel leaders and owned direct-to-consumer. Through this process, the brand implemented a product segmentation and exclusive strategy, tailoring the consumer experience for each unique access point. With an optimized marketplace, we believe Sanuk has the opportunity to build on its loyal consumer base through innovation and comfort, and sustainability and continue as a positive contributor to our total company bottom line. With respect to channel performance in fiscal 2021, the strength of e-commerce drove DTC to increase 45% over the prior year, helping improve our mix of DTC revenue to 42%, up from 35% last year. Every brand in our portfolio experienced growth through the direct-to-consumer channel across both domestic and international regions. Global consumer acquisition online, which increased 88% over last year, was the primary driver of DTC performance in fiscal 2021. This was partially offset by a decline in retail traffic that resulted from macro pandemic pressures. Despite the reduction in consumer traffic to stores, people were shopping with the intent to purchase as we saw a 30% increase in conversion. We believe this higher rated purchase conversion can be attributed to improved omnichannel capabilities, including buy online pickup in store, mobile POS systems and curbside pickup, which helped provide a more seamless experience at our stores. A huge thank you to our store employees who made consumers safety and a positive experience, a top priority amidst difficult circumstances. Global wholesale revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased 6% as compared to last year. Wholesale growth was driven by the global expansion of HOKA, with offsets from international UGG, as well as global reductions in Teva and Sanuk. UGG experienced strength in domestic wholesale that was more than offset by an international decline, which was due to a combination of marketplace reset initiatives and macro pressures from the pandemic. We see a path for international UGG wholesale to return to growth in fiscal 2022, helping to drive strength in global wholesale moving forward. Before I hand off the call to Steve, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of our brand\u2019s recent activities on the sustainability front, which we believe is having a positive impact on consumers\u2019 passion for our brands. Here at Deckers, we believe doing good is core to doing well and we intend to continue leading in this space. Over the past few months, UGG announced Earth Day commitments which highlighted the brand\u2019s commitment to regenerative farming. UGG introduced its first ever plant power collection, which features carbon neutral plant based materials. Teva launched its TevaForever program where consumers are now able to recycle old sandals that will be reborn into new things such as playgrounds or running tracks. Sanuk introduced limited edition collaboration with the Surfrider Foundation using environmentally friendly materials with proceeds benefiting Surfrider\u2019s mission to protect clean water and maintain healthy beaches. And we held our second Art of Kindness event, which is a week-long global giving initiative that encourages our employees across the globe to volunteer time towards causers helping others. This second Art of Kindness event included over 3,800 volunteer hours. We were able to double the employee participation from last year\u2019s event, a huge thank you to all employees who participated and helped to make a positive impact around the world. Our brands and our company are committed to giving back and doing business in the right way, and we look forward to pushing further progress in sustainability and service over the next year and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our fiscal 2021 financial results, as well as our initial outlook on fiscal 2022. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, fiscal year 2021 was an outstanding year for the Deckers organization, reaching a number of new milestones as we saw accelerated demand for our brands. The performance of our brands over the last year was enabled by the key long-term strategies we\u2019ve been investing behind that have helped transform Deckers into a digitally led organization with a portfolio of brands that are in demand and have further opportunity to grow. While our strategy has provided a solid foundation for the organization to perform well, we acknowledge that this past year has been full of unique circumstances that have helped put a spotlight on our brands. In particular, with the UGG brand, which was able to drive growth well beyond our pre-pandemic expectations, on the other hand, HOKA was able to overcome supply chain challenges and a disrupted wholesale marketplace to maintain the accelerated growth trajectory the brand has been experiencing prior to the pandemic. With total company topline growth accelerating faster than our ability to keep pace with investments, we acknowledge there is work ahead of us to realign infrastructure needs to our evolving organization. I\u2019ll provide more detail on these planned investments later in the call, but first let\u2019s get to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $561 million, up 50% versus the prior year, with the primary drivers of growth being UGG and HOKA. More specifically, growth in UGG was driven by strength in classic boots, winter boots and spring fluff products, while also benefiting from lapping last year\u2019s disruption of wholesale shipments, as well as retail store closures in the final two weeks of March. Continued exceptional performance with HOKA helped the brand deliver a quarterly revenue record increasing 74% versus the prior year to $178 million, as we continued to see strong brand momentum and incredible consumer adoption. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.2%, 170-basis-point improvement, driven by improved full price selling, a higher proportion of DTC business and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and transportation cost. SG&A for the quarter was $244 million or 43.5% of sales versus last year\u2019s $176 million or 47% of sales. The increase in spend was primarily driven by variable spend related to the increased revenue, as well as additional marketing, performance-related compensation and other items. These results demonstrate another exceptional quarter as we continue to see consumers seeking out our diverse offering of compelling products across our portfolio of brands. With the strength of the fourth quarter, our full fiscal year 2021 revenue came in at $2.546 billion, representing an increase of 19% versus the prior year. Performance as compared to the prior year was again driven by growth in the HOKA and UGG brands, as HOKA increased 62% over the prior year to $571 million with strength across all global regions and channels of distribution and UGG increased 13% over the prior year to $1.717 billion with growth of the U.S. offsetting international declines. Across our entire portfolio of brands, DTC was the primary driver of growth, increasing 45% over last year due to the strength of our online business, which overcame declines in the retail channel related to the pandemic. Gross margins for the year were up 220 basis points over last year to 54%. The increase in gross margin rate was related to 90 basis points from favorable channel mix, 80 basis points from lower promotional activity, including a reduction of closeouts, favorable brand mix as HOKA increased as a percentage of the total company and favorable foreign currency exchange rates with offsets coming from higher freight expense. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $870 million, up 14% from last year\u2019s $766 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by increased marketing to capitalize on momentum in our brands and begin to see localized marketing for international UGG, increased warehouse and logistics cost related to the compensation, as well as safety measures in place to protect our employees, increased spend on our e-commerce infrastructure to support the growth of that channel with offsets from lower retail store expense and travel savings that resulted from the pandemic. For the year, our tax rate was 23.7%, which compares to 19% last year. Taxes were higher this year as a result of a higher proportion of domestic revenue, as well as certain discrete items recognized in Q4. This all resulted in a record diluted earnings per share of $13.47 for the year, which compares to $9.62 in the fiscal year 2020. The more than $3 increase as compared to last year was driven by revenue growth in the HOKA and UGG brands, SG&A leverage as revenue growth exceeded expense growth, a greater mix of DTC revenue, a higher percentage of full price sales across our portfolio of brands, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, which was slightly offset by a higher tax rate. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2021, we ended fiscal year 2021 with $1.089 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $278 million, down 11% from $312 million at the same time last year and due to the repayment in full of our corporate headquarter mortgage we had no outstanding borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital above 30%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $99 million worth of shares at an average price of $322.87. I would note that for the majority of the year, we had paused share repurchase activity, as we shifted focus to preserving the strength of our balance sheet based on uncertainty related to the pandemic. Typically, at this point in the year, we would provide an update to our global backlog. Over the last few years, we have continued to signal that less and less emphasis should be placed on backlog as an indicator of future performance. Due to the evolution of our portfolio of brands and distribution strategies, as such we will no longer be providing backlog. Moving to our outlook, for fiscal year 2022, as Dave and I have touched on, fiscal 2021 was a year of full of unique circumstances, some of which directly benefited our brands. Beside just from the long-term evolution of Deckers, fiscal 2022 was thoughtfully planned to bolster the strong foundation already in place and set the table for sustained revenue and earnings power. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect a year-over-year topline growth rate of mid-to-high-teens leading to revenue in the range of $2.95 billion to $3 billion with HOKA growing in the 40% range, reaching an $800 million milestone; UGG growing in the high single digits to low double-digit range driven by domestic wholesale strength and international returning to growth; Koolaburra growing in the low double-digit range; Teva growing in the mid-single digit range; and Sanuk approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 53.3%, which is 70 basis points lower than FY 2021, due to increased shipping cost for ocean containers and air usage, unfavorable product mix shifting toward lower price items, potential channel mix headwinds related to the wholesale filling for the UGG and distributor growth in HOKA and inflationary pressures. SG&A is expected to be approximately 35.5% of revenue, as we made key investments to drive long-term growth and fuel near-term opportunities with variable spend. Strategic spending to drive the evolution of Deckers includes investment in our supply chain and logistics infrastructure to increase capacity with an additional distribution center in U.S., larger facilities internationally and improved planning tools to drive efficiencies, investment to further our digital transformation through added e-commerce capabilities to increase personalization and added analytical tools to optimize data insights and returns on marketing investments, investment in China to seed the HOKA opportunity and reignite UGG brand heat in the region, and investment to bolster our talent across the organization as we scale larger and enable emerging opportunities with added capabilities. Variable spending to fuel near-term opportunities include digital content creation to drive DTC conversion, targeted digital marketing to acquire new consumers, investments to drive growth in UGG ready-to-wear and build awareness of HOKA appear. Our expense and gross margin guidance represents an expected operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which aligns with our commitment to remain top tier among our peers. This targeted operating margin for FY 2022 represents meaningful expansion when compared to pre-pandemic years, where we had consistently achieved an operating margin of approximately 16% in FY 2019 and FY 2020. This demonstrates that we are flowing through a portion of recent margin expansion achieved in FY 2021 that we intend to preserve as we step into FY 2022. These include 90 basis points of channel mix with a larger proportion of DTC business, 50 basis points of brand mix as our mix of HOKA increases and expecting our rate of full price selling to be similar to that experienced in FY 2021. We are also projecting a tax rate of approximately 23%, all resulting in expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.05 to $14.65. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, representing a step up on recent years as we support the build out of a new distribution center in the U.S. and further reinforce our digital transformation through added IT infrastructure. Our fiscal 2022 guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact for additional share repurchase. We will not be providing formal quarterly guidance as the environment remains highly uncertain with regional differences in the pace and scope of economic recovery from the pandemic, as well as continued disruption across the entire supply chain as a result of the pandemic. In addition, with significantly lower inventory in the channel, the normal order and delivery pattern has shifted this year with a greater increase expected in the first half, further complicating expected timing of delivery. Therefore, it is important to note that a focus on a full year guidance best represents a holistic view of how we are driving full year long-term targets. For further context on how we are looking at the first half of the year, we expect strong global wholesale growth from both UGG and HOKA as both brands lap disruption in the channel from last year, and UGG benefits from earlier wholesale orders to fill in depleted inventories. Continued expansion of global HOKA direct-to-consumer as the brand acquires new consumers online through increased awareness and more consumers migrate online for replenishment. Higher marketing cost to keep UGG top of mind with consumers as less people are working from home, as well as a step up in our investment in localized content for international regions. Higher marketing costs for HOKA as the brand increases its presence at events with the world opening up, as well as increased spend to begin building awareness in China. Increased spend on people as we build our workforce and lap some savings experienced last year due to hiring and merit freeze. Elevated warehouse and logistics cost to support the increased scale of business both domestically and internationally with continued safety measures in place. And higher freight costs continuing to be a drag on gross margins. Overall, we anticipate first half revenue will represent a larger percentage of the full year revenue than in prior years. And finally, on capital allocation, with the build of our cash balance over the last year, we completed a thorough review of our strategy. Based on our goal to drive shareholder value, the Board of Directors has approved an increase of $750 million to the company\u2019s share repurchase authorization. This increased authorization in conjunction with higher capital expenditure investments supporting our key initiatives highlights the Board\u2019s confidence and management\u2019s ability to achieve our strategic plan and drive shareholder value while maintaining strength in liquidity. Deckers will maintain a competitive position versus peers, based on growing multiple brands in our portfolio, including one of the fastest growing footwear brands in HOKA, evolving our channel distribution with the long-term goal of reaching a 50% mix of DTC, achieving top tier levels of profitability and leadership in ESG space as we seek to do business in the right way by making positive contributions to our communities and the world at large. To close, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their dedication to managing through tough circumstances to deliver record results in an unprecedented year. I am excited for the years ahead as we invest behind the evolution of Deckers and capitalize on our strong portfolio of brands. Thanks, everyone and I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. Fiscal 2021 was an exceptional year for Deckers, as our company was able to build awareness and globally expand the HOKA brand as well as capitalize on the unique tailwinds for the UGG brand. Our long-term strategies enabled our brands to accelerate consumer acquisition online, which helped in company achieve the milestone of delivering a record operating profit of $0.5 billion. With strong momentum in our brands, we\u2019re going to maintain an aggressive approach to taking market share of wholesale, while also strengthening our digital capabilities to acquire consumers through our direct channels. We believe each of our brands has a compelling product offering for their respective target consumers. The health of our brands and the excitement for our products provide a strong setup for the year ahead. Our guidance includes mid to high-teen revenue growth with multiple brands expected to grow double digits, implying over $800 million of revenue added over two-year period. Deckers will remain top tier among peers while making important investment for the long-term evolution of the organization. We are confident in our long-term vision to drive more business through our direct-to-consumer channels, build the HOKA brand beyond $1 billion in revenue and increase our mix of business from international markets. To achieve these objectives and enable new opportunities with our portfolio of strong brands, we are focused on fostering existing talent within the organization, as well as acquiring new talent for added capabilities. I am proud to be leading this organization and greatly appreciate all the work of our employees over the past year and recognize the energy already being put forth to make fiscal 2022 just as great. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Camilo Lyon with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on a strong finish to the year.\nDave Powers: Hi, Camilo.\nCamilo Lyon: I wanted to -- hi. I wanted to follow up, Steve, on a comment you made just at the end of your remarks regarding including some of the wholesale partners of yours with inventory sooner. Clearly, I think, there\u2019s an anticipation there to avoid some of the supply chain disruptions that many have suffered this past year. I am curious how are you thinking about inventory build in anticipation of any chase opportunities given that you\u2019ll probably having to hold on some of that inventory a little bit longer through the season, given the earlier shipments that you\u2019ve spoken about?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. Let me -- thanks, Camilo. Good question. What we\u2019re seeing and I\u2019ll take a step back to just to kind of explain what\u2019s going on. I think with inventories low, our own inventory again down 11% and lower inventories as you mentioned kind of lower in the channel. We do want to bring in more inventory in the first couple of quarters and we do want to get it out to our wholesale customers, so that they have it in stock and on shelves during the prime selling season. So that is the shift from what we normally see. It may limit, I would say, the chase opportunities. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing kind of a more robust first half. I think that\u2019s why it was important to talk about kind of that first half context, because we\u2019re going to see a significant portion of that growth as we expect to fulfill those wholesale orders really in the first half as we bring inventory in. So we were replenishing our depleted inventory and we\u2019re getting out to our wholesale accounts sooner, so that they have it in stock. So we will see, again, it\u2019s one of the challenges that we\u2019re dealing with. As you know, there is significant disruption in the whole supply chain channel, another reason to try to get this inventory in earlier, so that we can avoid some of that disruption.\nDave Powers: Yeah. And just to add on to that, we did submit orders earlier than usual this year. So we are a little bit ahead of the game as far as production goes, but getting product into the country through the logistics domestically and onto our key accounts is poses a pretty meaningful challenge. We think we can overcome it. But the demand for inventory right now is still very strong. So our accounts are looking for inventory to keep the momentum going, but also start building reserves and stocks heading into the fall and holiday timeframe as well for all of our brands.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. Two just quick follow-ups, within that context, Steve, and Steve, you\u2019ve mentioned, some inflationary pressures impacting gross margin, is there any price taking that you are embedding in UGG or HOKA? And then just from a longer term perspective, you talked about the investments that you\u2019re making in the business and the right investments to be making in terms of infrastructure, distribution centers, digital investments to further the growth and long-term opportunities that you have in front of you. How do you think about what that looks like in the context of longer term EBIT margin opportunities as you start to leverage these investments this year in years two, three and four from now?\nDave Powers: Yeah. I can start. So, in price increases, selectively but not broad based and so we\u2019re looking at opportunities by categories, where we can, Fluff is an example of that. But generally speaking, we\u2019re not passing on price increases across the Board, just more selective styles going into this back of this year. I think we have more flexibility in our DTC channels to maybe do things here and there, but the season\u2019s sold in the inventories on its way and the wholesale accounts are expecting the prices that we\u2019ve already established. But we have healthy margins and we\u2019re expecting healthy high full price sell-throughs again and are confident in that. And from an investment perspective, yeah, with this rate of growth and the way that we pulled back on spend last year. We have some investments we need to make. We think that our brands, the demand for our brands is certainly stronger than it\u2019s ever been. Our brands matter to our consumers. They\u2019re really meaningful both on a product but also in emotional level and we see healthy path for growth, but we need to invest in the infrastructure to not only allow that, but then to sustain it and build even further. So, we think the 17% to 18% range is about right to be able to continue double-digit growth at the topline, but we also have to spend to fuel that. Over the years there may be a little upside to that and we can think about the flowing that through and we\u2019ll see how this year goes. But right now we feel like the right balance from a healthy brand building sustainable business is in the 17% to 18% range.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. And I think just to add on to that, Camilo, It\u2019s more than just a one-year investment.\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nSteve Fasching: So, as Dave said, we\u2019ve kind of targeted a range that we think is appropriate that kind of balances the investment, as well as what it can drive in sustainable growth, both from a revenue and earnings perspective. And yeah, there are some things that we\u2019ll be able to look at once these investments are in place to see what we can then leverage. But, I think, as Dave said, we need to make these investments now, let\u2019s see how they go and then we\u2019ll be in a better position down the road as to kind of figuring out how we could benefit from some of these investments.\nDave Powers: Yeah. And as we\u2019ve been talking about last few years, a lot -- a much higher percentage of our OpEx is variable. So we have a lot more flexibility in the year to either flow through or invest faster to drive topline growth. So we feel pretty confident that these are sustainable levels, and as I said, there might be opportunity for increase as we get into the next couple of years.\nCamilo Lyon: Excellent color. Congrats on the momentum.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Camilo.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Maybe Dave just first a follow-up, I think, you just mentioned double-digit topline growth. So I just wanted to maybe follow-up the context than your thoughts beyond the next year, if you think that\u2019s sustainable growth rate and maybe any thoughts on the pieces? And maybe relatedly, Steve, I think, you mentioned, some efficiencies from some of the infrastructure and analytics investments, any ability to break out some of the benefits expect to see from some of the investments this year?\nDave Powers: Yeah. So I\u2019ll answer your first question, Jonathan. Yeah. We see that path, certainly, this year is a little bit of a higher than normalized growth rate because of the filling component of particularly the UGG business and refilling the inventories for our wholesale accounts. So 19% is the highest we\u2019ve ever guided and we\u2019re confident in it. But we\u2019re mindful that a portion of that is filling. So you\u2019ll see the growth rates probably start to normalize closer to low double digits over the next year or two. But at this point, we feel like we have a clear line of sight to be able to continue to grow our brands globally, especially with the return to growth that we\u2019re starting to see in international, and HOKA really taking hold in the investments that we\u2019re making.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. And then, Jon, just on the kind of the leverage that we talked about kind of from a two-year stack. So, clearly, what we\u2019re passing through is some benefit that we\u2019ve seen in 2021. So as Dave kind of mentioned, we benefited by an acceleration of revenue and didn\u2019t necessarily spend against that revenue acceleration in FY 2021. So in 2022, there will be a bit of that catch-up to spend against really a two-year stack of high-teen revenue growth that we believe sets the foundation for more growth. In reference in my prepared remarks, where I talked about how we\u2019ve progressed from where we were, say two years ago, we\u2019re taking some of that leverage that we achieved in 2021 and really passing it through in 2022 as we\u2019ve seen some of those efficiencies. So it\u2019s some of the full price selling, there is going to be some on talent from where we were, say two years ago and so that\u2019s where we start to settle down from a proportion of SG&A spend to revenue in that, call it, roughly kind of 35%, 35.5% range. So, again, to the earlier question also, let\u2019s see how things go, this is a year where we\u2019re coming off the heels of strong revenue growth. We constrained some of that spend in 2022. We think it\u2019s important that we get back to making those investments that are setting us up for continuing this growth that we\u2019re seeing.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah. Great. And just one more on HOKA, any commentary on how some of the newer distribution in wholesale is faring either domestic or globally? And then it looks like a lot of new products coming up the next few months, so just any more comments on the pipeline and that approach to new product drops?\nDave Powers: Yeah. I would say, generally speaking, across the Board in new and existing accounts, sell-through continues to be very strong. And as you know, we\u2019ve been very methodical, the teams have done a great job of controlling strategic distribution, not going to too many doors too fast such as in case of DICK\u2019s, et cetera. That philosophy is applied globally and we\u2019re focused on healthy full-priced sell-through and creating demand and that is paying off and that\u2019s working. The areas we\u2019re expanding into is obviously bolstering outdoor, so trail and hike. You\u2019re going to start to see a little more product and focus on marketing lifestyle opportunities. So still performance product, but adapted for a lifestyle consumer. And then we\u2019re going to continue to drive that growth across the Board globally, each market is a little bit different as to which category we push first and how we get there, but that\u2019s the intent and the pipeline from my perspective is very strong. We have some great launches coming up this year. We have Clifton 8 launching in the next quarter, which we have a lot of demand. We\u2019re already pre-selling it on our website and the demand is there. So we feel great about the pipeline. So we can get the product to the supply chain of course and then expanding into other categories over the next 12 months to 18 months. We\u2019re very excited about it.\nJonathan Komp: Excellent. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Sorry, Clifton 8 in June.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah. That\u2019s right. Okay. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. And thank you so much. Dave, I was just wondering, if you could elaborate on the last answer a little bit, if you could maybe just take a step back and tell us, where you see HOKA in the maturity curve of this brand as it grows to a much bigger brand. As you see where the brand is right now, what\u2019s baked in the guidance, maybe take us through geographically where you see the biggest opportunities and where you hope to end the year by and where you see going it from there, and then maybe that would be a great place to start? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Sure. So, as we said in the script, we think that HOKA can get to $800 million this year, obviously, that\u2019s continued very aggressive growth opportunities. We also talked about the fact that the international growth is really kicking in from a units perspective, which is great to see the balance of that business globally and the balance across distribution. The one area that we talked about investing in and we\u2019re starting to invest in infrastructure building this year is China. It\u2019s still a relatively small business in China. It\u2019s a very exciting market for us to get into. We\u2019ve been leveraging really the UGG, the UGG team on the ground there for DTC, for HOKA, but it\u2019s time to start putting dedicated full-time heads on the HOKA team in China to get after that. So $800 million this year, obviously, we\u2019re on the path to $1 billion, earlier than we expected and the momentum seems to be just building, as people become more aware of the brand and we bring more consumers, particularly younger consumers into our ecosystem, really focusing on repeat purchases and expanding into new styles beyond just core running. We think the formula there is right, I think the control distribution, the product assortment, the fact that we are resonating in multiple categories, in multiple markets globally gives us a lot of confidence that I\u2019d say in some ways we\u2019re still in the early innings for this brand.\nSteve Fasching: And I think, Jay, just to add on to that, what we\u2019re seeing and we had the question on the wholesale distribution. So as Dave said, we\u2019re seeing tremendous progress within our wholesale distribution.\nJay Sole: Yeah.\nSteve Fasching: As Dave also said, what we\u2019re seeing is an acceleration of units. Now you don\u2019t necessarily see that in the same proportion on revenue, because much of our internationals is through distributors. So when we think about HOKA, and as Dave said, approaching $800 million faster than we previously thought clearly $1 billion in our sites, a lot of opportunity. One, as we bring more customers through our direct channels, we\u2019re seeing higher adoption through direct-to-consumer channel. On the international front, the investments that we\u2019re making will drive greater acceleration of growth on the international front. And then we have a channel opportunity that we can think about kind of down the road. So, clearly, very excited about the potential of HOKA and where it can go, and we\u2019re sitting in the very great place.\nJay Sole: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, is your SG&A going to follow the same, the flow of the business in the year or, I mean, should we think about that 35%, will we see it more front-end loaded on the investment or is it going to spread out of there?\nSteve Fasching: It\u2019s going to be spread out. Some of it needs to ramp, right? So you will see it a little bit in disproportion to the revenue growth. So we\u2019re going to see more revenue growth upfront as we\u2019re filling in the wholesale channels. We\u2019re going to be ramping investments really throughout the year. So, more revenue growth on the front half of ramping of investments really over the year.\nSam Poser: Yeah. Okay. And then, I\u2019ve got two more. One, do you expect the wholesale absolute revenue from UGG to be higher in Q3 or -- actually in Q2 or Q3 in absolute dollars. I mean or is Q3 still going to be the biggest or just going to be less growth?\nDave Powers: In some ways it\u2019s hard to call that right now, Sam, because of the supply chain challenges and so that\u2019s one of the reasons that quarterly guidance is challenging, because it\u2019s hard to say exactly when product is going to arrive and when we can get it out based on the quarter end. So that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re kind of dealing with is putting in more confidence into when product can arrive and calling the ball on that. Certainly, you\u2019re going to see an increase in the first half bigger than we have in the past, but exactly how that relates to Q3 versus Q2 sales, still a little early to make that call.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. And I think the other challenge, Sam, is we had such a strong Q3, Q4 that when you look at the comparison 2022 to 2021, right? We\u2019re going to be comparing against some very strong quarters in the back half. So when you think about percentage growth, it\u2019s really front half loaded in those terms, especially as we\u2019re trying to fill that wholesale channel earlier this year.\nSam Poser: Got you. And what percent of the marketing of the increased SG&A is being put towards digital marketing?\nDave Powers: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d have to get the exact number on that. I mean, it\u2019s significant, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in marketing across the board for HOKA and then also, but in key categories incremental marketing spend for UGG. So as a percentage of sales, marketing is going up across the board. So I don\u2019t know if we have the exact number of that. We can maybe get into in Q&A later. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. So a big part of the growth is relying on the fact that we are increasing marketing spend broadly and in new areas such as apparel and UGG for example and men\u2019s and kid\u2019s, but the rest is really on headcount and resources on the ground in China and infrastructure building.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then one last thing, M&A with -- are you looking at anybody, you\u2019ve talked about building out HOKA apparel and you said you might hire it, you might buy it. So you did, I know you\u2019re not going to give -- I am not going to get an answer, but I\u2019ll ask anyway. So you did a collab with Cotopaxi, very interesting, both with shoe did, as well as the apparel line -- the outdoor apparel line itself\u2026\nDave Powers: Yeah. It\u2019s\u2026\nSam Poser: \u2026et cetera\u2026\nDave Powers: Yeah. No. Just good business practice. We\u2019re always having conversations and we\u2019re open and -- but very selective. We have -- the biggest challenge for us is we have so much opportunity in our organic business today. It\u2019s hard to contemplate really doing something significant on top of that from a resource and just management\u2019s time perspective. The focus has served us well over the last four years or five years and we\u2019re going to continue down that approach. With that being said, we\u2019re -- just -- part of my job is just knowing what\u2019s happening out in the environment, talking to different brands and companies, early stages, late stages. But right now we\u2019re intently focused on the core organic growth that we have in front of us. And then as it relates to apparel, actually we believe more so now than ever that we don\u2019t necessarily need an acquisition to allow us to grow that business. Right now we\u2019re focused on building internal talent and capabilities, because of the strength of the brand, we think we can do that on top of our strong DTC channel, our supply chain and our omnichannel capabilities.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much. Continue the success.\nDave Powers: Thanks Sam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thanks. Hello, everyone.\nDave Powers: Hi, Jim.\nSteve Fasching: Hi, Jim.\nJim Duffy: Hope you guys are doing well. I wanted to start on the UGG business, the increasing frequency of purchase very encouraging. As you\u2019re thinking\u2026\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nJim Duffy: \u2026 about growth for this year, I recognize a component of it is still in, but can you provide some dimension to the domestic growth by discussing it across product categories? Are there any categories that have outsized drivers?\nDave Powers: Yeah. I think one thing that is really exciting, and as you mentioned it is the two things, one, the younger consumers that have begun to embrace the brand, which is something we\u2019ve been working on for a while and I think the brand has done an exceptional job of being relevant for that consumer both from a communication and product perspective. And we are finding that they\u2019re purchasing more often. Our cycle of repurchase for UGG used to be in the 18-month to 24-month range, now we\u2019re seeing multiple purposes in the same quarter as the product becomes more relevant year round. So we\u2019re going to continue to build on that. Obviously, the Fluff franchise, the slipper hybrid, indoor/outdoor slipper category is going to continue to be important for us. Although, slipper as a total category is not as big as you see in sneakers or boots or other areas, but for us it\u2019s very meaningful. So we\u2019re going to continue to build on that. Classics across the Board, the Ultra Mini is in the early days for us of excitement and growth. The Classic Clear is the style that we launched last year that sold out and there is big orders against that coming again this fall. We have a really compelling and exciting rain proposition in the UGG brand. And then you get into the heritage evolutions of things like the Tasman and how we\u2019re evolving that product into different materials and different use occasions for both men and women and the Neumel. So it\u2019s a combination of multiple categories inclusive of apparel. What was exciting about FY 2021 is the growth in UGG came from non-core product and then increased growth in men\u2019s and kid\u2019s. So this is the most broad-based enthusiasm I\u2019ve ever seen for the brand from gender and category perspective. It\u2019s much more balanced than we used to be, which is by design, which is very exciting for us. And I think it gives us a lot more opportunity to segment product by channel of distribution and consumer to make sure that we\u2019re having high sell-through and high rates of adoption across the board globally. So it\u2019s tough to put it. We\u2019re not relying on the Classics, like, we used to be anymore and there\u2019s a lot more exciting product and innovation going in across all the categories.\nJim Duffy: That\u2019s great to hear. And can you comment in a little more detail on what you\u2019re seeing with the ready-to-wear apparel business. It feels like that\u2019s gaining some momentum. Maybe give us a sense for where that stands? Is it percent of the mix and if you expect to see outsized growth from that in coming years?\nDave Powers: Yeah. The answer there is, yes. You\u2019re not going to see outsized growth this year. But what we learned last year with the ready-to-wear launch is that we have struck a nerve with the consumer that is a great combination of fun, fashionable UGG brand DNA, and comfortable that I think is perfect for UGG and I think there is white space in the market for us to be able to have a significant share of market and growth globally. It\u2019s relying on retail, it\u2019s relying on getting our e-commerce capabilities for apparel improved, so that we can fully showcase head-to-toe looks and drive the business through those channels and selective wholesale distribution globally. So the team has done a phenomenal job of positioning ourselves. Last year was really proof-of-concept for us and it proved to be very successful. We\u2019re super bullish about the opportunity over the next three years to five years and that\u2019s one of the areas you\u2019re going to see more investment in both on infrastructure but also on marketing and reaching global consumers.\nJim Duffy: Great. And just a point of clarification, I understand some of the strong growth this year is still in, Dave, I interpret your comments to Jonathan\u2019s question that you see UGG as a double-digit growth business over the intermediate term looking beyond fiscal 2023, I am sorry, fiscal 2022?\nDave Powers: That was more related to total company, Jim.\nJim Duffy: Okay. Okay.\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nJim Duffy: Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just shifting back to HOKA, you talked about $800 million this year, $1 billion plus being inside that\u2019s obviously revenue to you guys. I am kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about the size of that brand at retail five years down the road? And of that, whatever number you might be thinking about in terms of how large it can be, how much of that are you going to really kind of own that revenue versus continue to use the distributor model? And I guess, related to that as you talk about that double-digit growth over the next couple of years, do you incorporate an assumption of bringing some of that distributor business back in-house or in-house, I should say?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. Yeah. So I understand the question. Those are all questions that we are needling on a constant basis with our ELT and Board. All of those are opportunities. I think that the $800 million and the $1 billion number does not require the take backs of distributors at this point. I think that\u2019s a further out opportunity for us that requires a right level of investment in infrastructure for us to be able to do that correctly. But it\u2019s not necessary for us to hit these short-term targets. The longer term targets, that along with outsized growth from where we are today in China down the road expanded categories, apparel potential, you can see that there is a multi-billion dollar brand down the road at some point.\nPaul Lejuez: Yeah. Got you. And just to be clear, I just want to understand, when we talk about the supply chain, any pressures you might be seeing, can you just want to understand, like, which brands, which channels is that affecting most right now and how do you see that kind of fixing itself over the next several quarters?\nDave Powers: Yeah. The first thing I would say is, I want to give our operation and our supply chain teams a lot of credit for the way they handled last year. This success and our ability to chase demand in this environment and then to ramp-up for the growth that we\u2019re seeing and standing up in new DC, in the Midwest, getting the inventory, the orders in as fast as we can. They\u2019re kind of the unsung heroes of the story right now and they\u2019re doing a tremendous job. What that means going forward, the risks and the opportunities exist broadly speaking across the Board. But the biggest challenge for us is really domestic U.S., getting the inventory in over the next couple of months and getting it through our DCs and out to the wholesale account. So it\u2019s hard to say precisely which brand, which channel, et cetera. I would just say, it\u2019s more broad-based and we have a list of how we\u2019re prioritizing brands and channels within that to give us the best opportunity to be successful this year.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. And Paul -- and what I would say on the whole supply chain channel disruption is it\u2019s not unique to us.\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nSteve Fasching: This is something as you see right in the news everyone\u2019s experiencing. I think what -- we\u2019re in a better position than many of our peers, because last year we didn\u2019t cut back our orders as dramatically as many of our peers did, and as a result of that, we\u2019re in a better position with our factories. So as we\u2019re ramping up inventory into the year, we feel we\u2019re in a better position, still going to confront constraints and disruption. But we think we\u2019re better positioned than most, given how, as Dave said, we navigated last year. But still very mindful of what we\u2019re dealing with.\nDave Powers: Yeah. And I think that confidence is reflected in our guidance.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nDave Powers: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress. As you think about\u2026\nDave Powers: Thanks, Dana.\nDana Telsey: As you think about the current environment and going into next year, how -- going into this next fiscal year, how do you unpack the investment spend between the first half and the second half of the year? Do any of the COVID costs, do they roll-off, how do you see it in-bucketing, whether it\u2019s freight, whether it\u2019s wages, or COVID costs?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. Good question. And as we think about FY 2022 and we think about the ramping of investments, clearly, we\u2019re coming, as I said earlier, in a position where revenue was coming in faster than we could spend against it to build infrastructure. So I think to Sam\u2019s question earlier, we do see investments ramping in the year. So bringing new talent in is going to take time, putting up some of the infrastructure will take a little bit of time. But there are some upfront costs that we\u2019re incurring in the year. So as we think about those aspects, again, you\u2019ll see a build in the year related to that. In marketing, we are doing more marketing upfront\u2026\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nSteve Fasching: \u2026 this year, because we want to continue to fuel that demand that\u2019s in the marketplace. So you\u2019ll see some of the marketing increased investments in the first half of the year. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag if you look at the whole year. So -- but generally speaking, it takes some time to build that investment. So generally speaking, you will see a bit of a ramp. But there are components that we\u2019re going to spend more aggressively in the first half.\nDave Powers: Yeah. I think those are really related to, as you said, infrastructure building and marketing ahead of the curve in places like China. And -- but the one variable, Dana, that is the most challenging to call is hiring, because it\u2019s a competitive marketplace out there, we\u2019re selective in looking for top talent around the globe, we were pretty much on a hiring freeze all of last year, so we have a lot of catching up to do and in this environment, people are still working from home, it\u2019s hard to call the ball on how fast we can ramp-up key hires. But you know that we\u2019re aggressive about it. It\u2019s a number one priority for our new CHRO that came on three months ago and the team. And as I\u2019ve said, we have an opportunity with the momentum in our brands and the strength of our businesses to really find top talent globally and that\u2019s the priority. You don\u2019t want to rush it. But we are urgent about bringing on people pretty quick.\nDana Telsey: And on the people you\u2019re bringing in, is it marketing, is it merchants for apparel, what\u2019s your key priorities in who you\u2019re bringing in?\nDave Powers: China, marketing, creative for e-commerce and digital capabilities.\nDana Telsey: And then price increases, will we see any price increases this year and does it differ at all by brand?\nDave Powers: You won\u2019t see broad-based price increases this year. There might be some selective ones based on category and styles, Fluff is an opportunity for us from a pricing perspective. But generally speaking, we feel good about our prices. We think the proposition for the consumer is very compelling from a value proposition. Some other brands I think are talking about raising prices here and there. At this point, it\u2019s not a broad-based strategy of ours. We\u2019re continuing to focus on making sure that we have a very compelling offer for our consumer.\nDana Telsey: Just one last thing, anything on new wholesale customers, you\u2019re expanding with DICK\u2019S, any others that we should be thinking about?\nDave Powers: Not of that size. Selective ones, think about the HOKA lifestyle opportunity and key accounts like Free People that we are just launching with this year. But more generally, we\u2019re reducing accounts for UGG still and focused on the top key strategic accounts that we have. So wholesale expansion other than opportunities where we\u2019re trying to get a younger consumer for UGG or get into new category opportunities in HOKA, but generally speaking, wholesale door expansion is not a major strategy of ours.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Oh! Good afternoon and thank you for squeezing me in. Steve, I think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that, you anticipated first half revenues to represent a larger percentage of your overall full year guide. I understand you\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance. But can you just kind of give us kind of benchmarks? Historically, you\u2019ve been pretty consistent that, your 1H revenues are about 37% of your overall revenues. So any framework on that just for us to understand would be very helpful?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. I think the, again, not giving guidance, but when you think about the percentage growth for the year, again, as I said earlier on the Q&A, where we will be lapping very strong Q3 and Q4. The majority of our -- large majority of our percentage revenue growth will be occurring, as we expect, if things go according to plan in that first half. But again, as Dave said, there is a lot of moving pieces. There is a lot of -- still as we\u2019re rebuilding inventory, trying to get that inventory in time and then turned around at our DC. It\u2019s also working with wholesalers to have them take product earlier. I think we\u2019re in a relatively good place where they are rebuilding their inventory levels as well, so if things play out as we see it, right, that will create much stronger growth on a percentage terms in the first half. Now some of that can drift, again, which is why we don\u2019t want to give guidance yet because we have a lot of shipping that goes out in those final two weeks of quarters, which is kind of the way it lands. So things can move relatively easy between quarters.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. And then as a follow-up question, in terms of HOKA growth, the 40% growth, I think you alluded to in your prepared remarks in terms of number of pairs, roughly half is done overseas, maybe can you just kind of give us some context that for the full year, fiscal year 2021, where do your international revenues fall in terms of dollars? And then does the 40% growth, does it anticipate any taking any of your distribution in-house in Europe?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. I\u2019ll take the last one first. No. We do not. Not at this stage or this year. We are looking at this way. And then in terms of domestic versus international, we don\u2019t really break that out. Other than to say, just to give a little bit of color on the half year, I\u2019ll say, a little bit more growth on HOKA in the front half, again, as we lap bigger quarters in the back half, again, on percentage terms.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Thank you very much.\nDave Powers: Yeah.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference is also now concluded.

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before diving into the business, I'd like to express my gratitude for the progress towards ending the pandemic's toll in the United States. However, countries around the world are still struggling with dangerous outbreaks. Many of our employees have friends and family members that are currently being impacted by the devastating COVID-19 surge within India, Nepal and other South Asian countries. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected by this pandemic over the past year and a half, and on behalf of Deckers, I wish for everyone's health and safety moving forward. As I reflect on this past year, I am continually impressed by the tenacity and resiliency of the Deckers organization, and the dedication demonstrated by our teams as they continued to deliver exceptional results. FY 2021 results were driven by the exceptional brand and marketplace management of our leaders, but also by the global operations, retail and supply chain teams, who allowed us to fulfill the demand for our brands. By continuing to be aggressive with HOKA globally and capturing the opportunity in UGG, we were able to exceed expectations in a challenging environment and have accelerated the pace of growth for our brands. Today, I am excited to share the results of a record breaking year for Deckers. We saw a strong finish to fiscal 2021, with full year revenue increasing 19% versus last year to over $2.5 billion and earnings per share increasing 40% to $13.47. FY 2021 performance was driven by expanded awareness and adoption of HOKA around the world, as more consumers experienced the benefits of the brand's innovative products, consumer actively seeking UGG for its unique combination of fashion appeal and the unmistakable feeling of the brand, best-in-class e-commerce capabilities that enabled consumer acquisition in a disrupted physical retail environment, strategic prioritization of brand strength and demand creation through disciplined marketplace management and the grit of our employees who overcame significant macro challenges and operational pressures to deliver exceptional results. Many of these items that drove performance during the year were the results of our long-term strategies that remain top of mind as we transition into fiscal 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, these include accelerating consumer adoption of the HOKA brand globally, building UGG as a year-round global lifestyle brand through a diverse product offering, executing our digital first approach by growing direct-to-consumer acquisition and retention online with a specific focus on gaining closet space with 18 year-old to 34 year-old consumers, tailoring distribution strategies unique to each of our brands in order to properly balance brand health in conjunction with sustainable growth, which includes the recent reset activities for the UGG brand internationally and focusing spend behind these key initiatives to drive optimal returns on investment, while maintaining top tier levels of profitability. While we believe that remaining committed to our long-term strategies was the primary enabler of our success this year, Deckers also uniquely benefited from certain circumstances resulting from the pandemic. Fiscal 2021 revenue exceeded our pre-pandemic expectations as we saw an acceleration of certain growth opportunities. With brands scaling faster than previously anticipated, we now need to accelerate critical investments to scale our supply chain and logistics infrastructure, as well as bolster our teams with additional talent to prepare for emerging opportunities. Fiscal 2022 will be another positive step in the evolution of Deckers Brands, as we strategically invest behind core infrastructure needs and seed opportunities that will enable sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth. Over the long-term, we're investing in major drivers of our business, including building HOKA to $1 billion plus global performance brand that represents a significant portion of total company revenue, driving our direct-to-consumer business towards 50% of our global revenues, scaling international markets across brands and seeding opportunities beyond footwear. Steve will provide more details on these investments, as well as our forward looking revenue and margin expectations later in the call. In the meantime, I will share some details around fiscal 2021 performance at the brand and channel levels, as well as provide some context around fiscal 2022 building blocks. Starting with the brand highlights, global UGG fiscal 2021 revenue increased 13% versus last year to $1.717 billion. The brand's success in FY 2021 was primarily due to U.S. consumers actively seeking UGG products all year long with search interest increasing 27% over fiscal 2020 according to Google Trends, which led to accelerated consumer acquisition online as the brand added over 2.5 million new consumers to its global e-commerce database and captured the critical 18-year to 34-year aged consumer in the U.S., which increased 83% to the elevated fashion appeal to brand. And lastly, more consumers purchased multiple UGG products than ever before, as the brand saw an 85% increase in consumers purchasing two of our products during the year. We believe much of the brand heat that created momentum for UGG in the U.S. resulted from the brand's strategically managed distribution network, authentic PR activations, fashion collaborations, targeted digital marketing and a compelling product offering that has expanded the fashion relevance of UGG brand DNA across new categories. As evidence of the UGG brand's success with a diversified assortment, fiscal 2021 product performance was driven by the expansion of the Fluff franchise, as the brand drove demand to both the original Fluff Yeah, as well as complementary styles with similar slipper-sandal hybrid attributes, increased adoption of the New Male franchise among men, women and kids, the introduction of the Ultra Mini and Classic Clear boots, which were particularly popular with younger consumers, development of the Tasman into a fashion slipper sneaker, as UGG featured the style in a number of recent collaborations, helping to raise the hybrid style's profile, the brand's first ever ready-to-wear apparel collection, which featured fashionable sportswear and outerwear pieces and Heritage slippers having greater year round relevancy as many people were working from home and seeking the comfort of what we refer to as the feeling of UGG. These styles that drove UGG growth this year made up the majority of both the brand's top 10 styles purchased by acquired consumers, as well as the top 10 styles purchased by consumers 18 years old to 34 years old. While women remain the primary purchasers of UGG products, the brand's mix of gender continues to shift towards men's and kid's products. Part of this shift is due to many consumers purchasing UGG for the whole family. In the U.S., as compared to last year, UGG experienced an 88% increase in DTC revenue from orders containing both men's and women's products, and 117% increase in orders containing both kid's and women's products. With more purchasing for the whole family, both men's and kid's footwear increased as a percentage of total UGG brand business. While the U.S. has been driving UGG category diversification over the past few years, we have been encouraged by the adoption of new categories within international regions over the last year as well. Such is the Ultra Mini which was a top five style in its introductory season, the Classic Clear which was ranked second new style in terms of dollar volume, Fluff franchise volume was 2.5 times larger than last year, and sneakers were standout in our Asia-Pacific region. Improvements in new category adoption are largely attributable to localized marketing activations meant to build UGG brand heat internationally and attracting younger consumers to the brand. Our targeted digital marketing efforts are paying off, as UGG experienced a significant increase in e-commerce traffic from visitors aged 18 to 34 in both the U.K. and China during FY 2021. These early indicators of success and our plan to further invest behind localized marketing tactics give us confidence that UGG will rebound and return to growth in the brand's international markets during fiscal 2022. UGG has a difficult task ahead in lapping a record year, where we benefited from the pandemic driving greater attention to the brand. However, with our planned investments and demand creation, we have confidence the brand can drive topline revenue growth in fiscal 2022 by fulfilling wholesale demand as we reset the marketplace with filling product and satisfy some of the missed opportunities in fiscal 2021 during inventory shortages, maintaining momentum with the younger consumers around the world and driving repeat purchases from consumers new to the brand in FY 2021, recovering lost volume in EMEA with the goal of lapping fiscal 2020 revenues and maximizing demand captured through DTC, increasing local investments in China to elevate the brand and accelerate revenue growth, all while working to lap growth on heritage slipper products that benefited from the pandemic. Shifting your attention to HOKA, global revenue in fiscal 2021 increased 62% versus last year to $571 million. The growth of HOKA over the past year was a testament to the brand's methodical approach to managing a consistent brand message and introducing innovative products that resonate across the global distribution landscape. HOKA continues to exhibit balanced growth across its ecosystem of access points with every region and channel distribution increasing volume above last year. The increasing scale of HOKA is undeniably impressive. But even more importantly, the brand is growing in the right way and making meaningful progress towards strategic initiates. In a year of uncertainty, HOKA initially doubled down on key franchises, with the goal of amplifying hero styles to bring new consumers to the brand. As these styles drove consumer acquisition, HOKA was successful in driving more repeat purchases in alternate products. This is the result of the HOKA team's development of innovative products, built for speed such as the Carbon X2 and Mach 4, the outdoors with the Speedgoat and Challenger for trail running and the Kaha for hiking and recovery featuring the Ora Flip Flops and Slides. In addition to providing great product for all athletes, HOKA has also created meaningful partnerships to build the lifestyle relevance of its performance products. One such partnership includes the brand's recent launch with Free People, which helps expose HOKA products to consumers who may not otherwise discover their brand. This is not meant to signal a shift towards fashion for the HOKA brand, but rather the brand embracing the fashionable attributes of its performance products and gaining an audience of younger consumers. In addition to targeting youth wholesale distribution, the HOKA DTC team prioritize digital spend on platforms where younger consumers are spending time and discovering brands online. The brand has also been working to create a seamless replenishment experience for consumers who may have discovered HOKA elsewhere. Through these efforts, HOKA was able to increase 18 to 34-year-old consumer acquisition online by 156% as compared to last year. We believe the HOKA brand's commitment to building a more diverse outdoor community by including underrepresented groups in 60% of marketing content is resonating well with younger consumers. HOKA is winning with the combination of disrupted product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing and a consistent consumer experience based on the quality of the brand's products and ecosystem of access points. From a regional standpoint, both domestic and international posted impressive gains in fiscal 2021, but the international revenue growth rate was able to outpace domestic up a lower base. As we've spoken about in prior earnings calls, the mix of international unit to the global total continues to move towards the 50-50 split, but revenue is more favored towards domestic because of the use of distributors internationally. In FY 2021, distributors drove the largest proportion of international HOKA revenue growth, greater than both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. We see this as both a positive reflection of HOKA distributor's ability to scale the brand as well as an opportunity for global growth as we continue to strategically evolve our distribution of the brand around the world. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we anticipate HOKA growth will continue at a rapid pace driven by acquiring new consumers by building brand awareness, retaining existing consumers with product and category innovation, gaining market share with wholesale partners, building global brand presence through a return of in-person event sponsorship, focusing on key markets in Europe such as Germany and the U.K., and increasing the frequency of product drops to maintain excitement with consumers. In addition, as we invest to the longer term, we are earmarking investment in China for the HOKA brand to build a meaningful presence in that region. This includes building a team local to the market and creating a retail presence to the HOKA brand. Turning to Teva, despite relatively flat revenue of $139 million, Teva made productive strides towards the future as the brand invested behind the universal franchise, which experienced strong growth versus last year, increased the penetration of DTC to the total brand by 10 percentage points, nearly doubled direct-to-consumer acquisition year-over-year, strengthened partnerships with strategic wholesale accounts, contributed incremental profitability to Deckers bottomline and made further enhancement towards sustainability goals. Looking ahead, Teva is focused on being a leader in sustainability, building year-round innovative product for the modern outdoor consumer, taking market share in the closed-toe space with the brand's Ember franchise, building on DTC consumer acquisition and maintaining a high proportion of 18-year-old to 34-year-old consumers. Moving to Koolaburra, global revenue in fiscal 2021 increased 9% versus last year to $76 million. Performance this year was influenced by conservative ordering at the onset of the pandemic, as we chose to reduce inventory purchases in strategic areas of the brand portfolio. Based on high levels of consumer demand, Koolaburra experienced both topline revenue growth and record profitability, despite scarce product availability and disruptions in the wholesale family value channel. For the year ahead, we expect Koolaburra to continue building market share with existing wholesale partners through door count expansion, build on the direct-to-consumer momentum experienced in fiscal 2021 as the brand more than doubled consumer acquisition compared to the prior year, further diversified the assortment through the growth of men's product and women's non-boot categories which experienced outsized growth this year and expand the brand's lifestyle appeal through license opportunities with new product adjacencies. And finally, Sanuk revenue in fiscal 2021 declined to $42 million. Over the last year, the Sanuk team made great progress to right-size the brand's distribution, focusing on wholesale channel leaders and owned direct-to-consumer. Through this process, the brand implemented a product segmentation and exclusive strategy, tailoring the consumer experience for each unique access point. With an optimized marketplace, we believe Sanuk has the opportunity to build on its loyal consumer base through innovation and comfort, and sustainability and continue as a positive contributor to our total company bottom line. With respect to channel performance in fiscal 2021, the strength of e-commerce drove DTC to increase 45% over the prior year, helping improve our mix of DTC revenue to 42%, up from 35% last year. Every brand in our portfolio experienced growth through the direct-to-consumer channel across both domestic and international regions. Global consumer acquisition online, which increased 88% over last year, was the primary driver of DTC performance in fiscal 2021. This was partially offset by a decline in retail traffic that resulted from macro pandemic pressures. Despite the reduction in consumer traffic to stores, people were shopping with the intent to purchase as we saw a 30% increase in conversion. We believe this higher rated purchase conversion can be attributed to improved omnichannel capabilities, including buy online pickup in store, mobile POS systems and curbside pickup, which helped provide a more seamless experience at our stores. A huge thank you to our store employees who made consumers safety and a positive experience, a top priority amidst difficult circumstances. Global wholesale revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased 6% as compared to last year. Wholesale growth was driven by the global expansion of HOKA, with offsets from international UGG, as well as global reductions in Teva and Sanuk. UGG experienced strength in domestic wholesale that was more than offset by an international decline, which was due to a combination of marketplace reset initiatives and macro pressures from the pandemic. We see a path for international UGG wholesale to return to growth in fiscal 2022, helping to drive strength in global wholesale moving forward. Before I hand off the call to Steve, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of our brand's recent activities on the sustainability front, which we believe is having a positive impact on consumers' passion for our brands. Here at Deckers, we believe doing good is core to doing well and we intend to continue leading in this space. Over the past few months, UGG announced Earth Day commitments which highlighted the brand's commitment to regenerative farming. UGG introduced its first ever plant power collection, which features carbon neutral plant based materials. Teva launched its TevaForever program where consumers are now able to recycle old sandals that will be reborn into new things such as playgrounds or running tracks. Sanuk introduced limited edition collaboration with the Surfrider Foundation using environmentally friendly materials with proceeds benefiting Surfrider's mission to protect clean water and maintain healthy beaches. And we held our second Art of Kindness event, which is a week-long global giving initiative that encourages our employees across the globe to volunteer time towards causers helping others. This second Art of Kindness event included over 3,800 volunteer hours. We were able to double the employee participation from last year's event, a huge thank you to all employees who participated and helped to make a positive impact around the world. Our brands and our company are committed to giving back and doing business in the right way, and we look forward to pushing further progress in sustainability and service over the next year and beyond. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our fiscal 2021 financial results, as well as our initial outlook on fiscal 2022. Steve? Thanks, Steve. Fiscal 2021 was an exceptional year for Deckers, as our company was able to build awareness and globally expand the HOKA brand as well as capitalize on the unique tailwinds for the UGG brand. Our long-term strategies enabled our brands to accelerate consumer acquisition online, which helped in company achieve the milestone of delivering a record operating profit of $0.5 billion. With strong momentum in our brands, we're going to maintain an aggressive approach to taking market share of wholesale, while also strengthening our digital capabilities to acquire consumers through our direct channels. We believe each of our brands has a compelling product offering for their respective target consumers. The health of our brands and the excitement for our products provide a strong setup for the year ahead. Our guidance includes mid to high-teen revenue growth with multiple brands expected to grow double digits, implying over $800 million of revenue added over two-year period. Deckers will remain top tier among peers while making important investment for the long-term evolution of the organization. We are confident in our long-term vision to drive more business through our direct-to-consumer channels, build the HOKA brand beyond $1 billion in revenue and increase our mix of business from international markets. To achieve these objectives and enable new opportunities with our portfolio of strong brands, we are focused on fostering existing talent within the organization, as well as acquiring new talent for added capabilities. I am proud to be leading this organization and greatly appreciate all the work of our employees over the past year and recognize the energy already being put forth to make fiscal 2022 just as great. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator? Hi, Camilo. Yeah. And just to add on to that, we did submit orders earlier than usual this year. So we are a little bit ahead of the game as far as production goes, but getting product into the country through the logistics domestically and onto our key accounts is poses a pretty meaningful challenge. We think we can overcome it. But the demand for inventory right now is still very strong. So our accounts are looking for inventory to keep the momentum going, but also start building reserves and stocks heading into the fall and holiday timeframe as well for all of our brands. Yeah. I can start. So, in price increases, selectively but not broad based and so we're looking at opportunities by categories, where we can, Fluff is an example of that. But generally speaking, we're not passing on price increases across the Board, just more selective styles going into this back of this year. I think we have more flexibility in our DTC channels to maybe do things here and there, but the season's sold in the inventories on its way and the wholesale accounts are expecting the prices that we've already established. But we have healthy margins and we're expecting healthy high full price sell-throughs again and are confident in that. And from an investment perspective, yeah, with this rate of growth and the way that we pulled back on spend last year. We have some investments we need to make. We think that our brands, the demand for our brands is certainly stronger than it's ever been. Our brands matter to our consumers. They're really meaningful both on a product but also in emotional level and we see healthy path for growth, but we need to invest in the infrastructure to not only allow that, but then to sustain it and build even further. So, we think the 17% to 18% range is about right to be able to continue double-digit growth at the topline, but we also have to spend to fuel that. Over the years there may be a little upside to that and we can think about the flowing that through and we'll see how this year goes. But right now we feel like the right balance from a healthy brand building sustainable business is in the 17% to 18% range. Yeah. Yeah. And as we've been talking about last few years, a lot -- a much higher percentage of our OpEx is variable. So we have a lot more flexibility in the year to either flow through or invest faster to drive topline growth. So we feel pretty confident that these are sustainable levels, and as I said, there might be opportunity for increase as we get into the next couple of years. Thanks, Camilo. Yeah. So I'll answer your first question, Jonathan. Yeah. We see that path, certainly, this year is a little bit of a higher than normalized growth rate because of the filling component of particularly the UGG business and refilling the inventories for our wholesale accounts. So 19% is the highest we've ever guided and we're confident in it. But we're mindful that a portion of that is filling. So you'll see the growth rates probably start to normalize closer to low double digits over the next year or two. But at this point, we feel like we have a clear line of sight to be able to continue to grow our brands globally, especially with the return to growth that we're starting to see in international, and HOKA really taking hold in the investments that we're making. Yeah. I would say, generally speaking, across the Board in new and existing accounts, sell-through continues to be very strong. And as you know, we've been very methodical, the teams have done a great job of controlling strategic distribution, not going to too many doors too fast such as in case of DICK's, et cetera. That philosophy is applied globally and we're focused on healthy full-priced sell-through and creating demand and that is paying off and that's working. The areas we're expanding into is obviously bolstering outdoor, so trail and hike. You're going to start to see a little more product and focus on marketing lifestyle opportunities. So still performance product, but adapted for a lifestyle consumer. And then we're going to continue to drive that growth across the Board globally, each market is a little bit different as to which category we push first and how we get there, but that's the intent and the pipeline from my perspective is very strong. We have some great launches coming up this year. We have Clifton 8 launching in the next quarter, which we have a lot of demand. We're already pre-selling it on our website and the demand is there. So we feel great about the pipeline. So we can get the product to the supply chain of course and then expanding into other categories over the next 12 months to 18 months. We're very excited about it. Sorry, Clifton 8 in June. Yeah. Sure. So, as we said in the script, we think that HOKA can get to $800 million this year, obviously, that's continued very aggressive growth opportunities. We also talked about the fact that the international growth is really kicking in from a units perspective, which is great to see the balance of that business globally and the balance across distribution. The one area that we talked about investing in and we're starting to invest in infrastructure building this year is China. It's still a relatively small business in China. It's a very exciting market for us to get into. We've been leveraging really the UGG, the UGG team on the ground there for DTC, for HOKA, but it's time to start putting dedicated full-time heads on the HOKA team in China to get after that. So $800 million this year, obviously, we're on the path to $1 billion, earlier than we expected and the momentum seems to be just building, as people become more aware of the brand and we bring more consumers, particularly younger consumers into our ecosystem, really focusing on repeat purchases and expanding into new styles beyond just core running. We think the formula there is right, I think the control distribution, the product assortment, the fact that we are resonating in multiple categories, in multiple markets globally gives us a lot of confidence that I'd say in some ways we're still in the early innings for this brand. Thanks, Jay. In some ways it's hard to call that right now, Sam, because of the supply chain challenges and so that's one of the reasons that quarterly guidance is challenging, because it's hard to say exactly when product is going to arrive and when we can get it out based on the quarter end. So that's one of the things we're kind of dealing with is putting in more confidence into when product can arrive and calling the ball on that. Certainly, you're going to see an increase in the first half bigger than we have in the past, but exactly how that relates to Q3 versus Q2 sales, still a little early to make that call. Yeah. I mean, I'd have to get the exact number on that. I mean, it's significant, and we're continuing to invest in marketing across the board for HOKA and then also, but in key categories incremental marketing spend for UGG. So as a percentage of sales, marketing is going up across the board. So I don't know if we have the exact number of that. We can maybe get into in Q&A later. But that's how we're thinking about it. So a big part of the growth is relying on the fact that we are increasing marketing spend broadly and in new areas such as apparel and UGG for example and men's and kid's, but the rest is really on headcount and resources on the ground in China and infrastructure building. Yeah. It's... Yeah. No. Just good business practice. We're always having conversations and we're open and -- but very selective. We have -- the biggest challenge for us is we have so much opportunity in our organic business today. It's hard to contemplate really doing something significant on top of that from a resource and just management's time perspective. The focus has served us well over the last four years or five years and we're going to continue down that approach. With that being said, we're -- just -- part of my job is just knowing what's happening out in the environment, talking to different brands and companies, early stages, late stages. But right now we're intently focused on the core organic growth that we have in front of us. And then as it relates to apparel, actually we believe more so now than ever that we don't necessarily need an acquisition to allow us to grow that business. Right now we're focused on building internal talent and capabilities, because of the strength of the brand, we think we can do that on top of our strong DTC channel, our supply chain and our omnichannel capabilities. Thanks Sam. Hi, Jim. Yeah. Yeah. I think one thing that is really exciting, and as you mentioned it is the two things, one, the younger consumers that have begun to embrace the brand, which is something we've been working on for a while and I think the brand has done an exceptional job of being relevant for that consumer both from a communication and product perspective. And we are finding that they're purchasing more often. Our cycle of repurchase for UGG used to be in the 18-month to 24-month range, now we're seeing multiple purposes in the same quarter as the product becomes more relevant year round. So we're going to continue to build on that. Obviously, the Fluff franchise, the slipper hybrid, indoor/outdoor slipper category is going to continue to be important for us. Although, slipper as a total category is not as big as you see in sneakers or boots or other areas, but for us it's very meaningful. So we're going to continue to build on that. Classics across the Board, the Ultra Mini is in the early days for us of excitement and growth. The Classic Clear is the style that we launched last year that sold out and there is big orders against that coming again this fall. We have a really compelling and exciting rain proposition in the UGG brand. And then you get into the heritage evolutions of things like the Tasman and how we're evolving that product into different materials and different use occasions for both men and women and the Neumel. So it's a combination of multiple categories inclusive of apparel. What was exciting about FY 2021 is the growth in UGG came from non-core product and then increased growth in men's and kid's. So this is the most broad-based enthusiasm I've ever seen for the brand from gender and category perspective. It's much more balanced than we used to be, which is by design, which is very exciting for us. And I think it gives us a lot more opportunity to segment product by channel of distribution and consumer to make sure that we're having high sell-through and high rates of adoption across the board globally. So it's tough to put it. We're not relying on the Classics, like, we used to be anymore and there's a lot more exciting product and innovation going in across all the categories. Yeah. The answer there is, yes. You're not going to see outsized growth this year. But what we learned last year with the ready-to-wear launch is that we have struck a nerve with the consumer that is a great combination of fun, fashionable UGG brand DNA, and comfortable that I think is perfect for UGG and I think there is white space in the market for us to be able to have a significant share of market and growth globally. It's relying on retail, it's relying on getting our e-commerce capabilities for apparel improved, so that we can fully showcase head-to-toe looks and drive the business through those channels and selective wholesale distribution globally. So the team has done a phenomenal job of positioning ourselves. Last year was really proof-of-concept for us and it proved to be very successful. We're super bullish about the opportunity over the next three years to five years and that's one of the areas you're going to see more investment in both on infrastructure but also on marketing and reaching global consumers. That was more related to total company, Jim. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. The first thing I would say is, I want to give our operation and our supply chain teams a lot of credit for the way they handled last year. This success and our ability to chase demand in this environment and then to ramp-up for the growth that we're seeing and standing up in new DC, in the Midwest, getting the inventory, the orders in as fast as we can. They're kind of the unsung heroes of the story right now and they're doing a tremendous job. What that means going forward, the risks and the opportunities exist broadly speaking across the Board. But the biggest challenge for us is really domestic U.S., getting the inventory in over the next couple of months and getting it through our DCs and out to the wholesale account. So it's hard to say precisely which brand, which channel, et cetera. I would just say, it's more broad-based and we have a list of how we're prioritizing brands and channels within that to give us the best opportunity to be successful this year. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that confidence is reflected in our guidance. Thanks. Thanks, Dana. Yeah. Yeah. I think those are really related to, as you said, infrastructure building and marketing ahead of the curve in places like China. And -- but the one variable, Dana, that is the most challenging to call is hiring, because it's a competitive marketplace out there, we're selective in looking for top talent around the globe, we were pretty much on a hiring freeze all of last year, so we have a lot of catching up to do and in this environment, people are still working from home, it's hard to call the ball on how fast we can ramp-up key hires. But you know that we're aggressive about it. It's a number one priority for our new CHRO that came on three months ago and the team. And as I've said, we have an opportunity with the momentum in our brands and the strength of our businesses to really find top talent globally and that's the priority. You don't want to rush it. But we are urgent about bringing on people pretty quick. China, marketing, creative for e-commerce and digital capabilities. You won't see broad-based price increases this year. There might be some selective ones based on category and styles, Fluff is an opportunity for us from a pricing perspective. But generally speaking, we feel good about our prices. We think the proposition for the consumer is very compelling from a value proposition. Some other brands I think are talking about raising prices here and there. At this point, it's not a broad-based strategy of ours. We're continuing to focus on making sure that we have a very compelling offer for our consumer. Not of that size. Selective ones, think about the HOKA lifestyle opportunity and key accounts like Free People that we are just launching with this year. But more generally, we're reducing accounts for UGG still and focused on the top key strategic accounts that we have. So wholesale expansion other than opportunities where we're trying to get a younger consumer for UGG or get into new category opportunities in HOKA, but generally speaking, wholesale door expansion is not a major strategy of ours. You bet. Yeah."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, fiscal year 2021 was an outstanding year for the Deckers organization, reaching a number of new milestones as we saw accelerated demand for our brands. The performance of our brands over the last year was enabled by the key long-term strategies we've been investing behind that have helped transform Deckers into a digitally led organization with a portfolio of brands that are in demand and have further opportunity to grow. While our strategy has provided a solid foundation for the organization to perform well, we acknowledge that this past year has been full of unique circumstances that have helped put a spotlight on our brands. In particular, with the UGG brand, which was able to drive growth well beyond our pre-pandemic expectations, on the other hand, HOKA was able to overcome supply chain challenges and a disrupted wholesale marketplace to maintain the accelerated growth trajectory the brand has been experiencing prior to the pandemic. With total company topline growth accelerating faster than our ability to keep pace with investments, we acknowledge there is work ahead of us to realign infrastructure needs to our evolving organization. I'll provide more detail on these planned investments later in the call, but first let's get to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $561 million, up 50% versus the prior year, with the primary drivers of growth being UGG and HOKA. More specifically, growth in UGG was driven by strength in classic boots, winter boots and spring fluff products, while also benefiting from lapping last year's disruption of wholesale shipments, as well as retail store closures in the final two weeks of March. Continued exceptional performance with HOKA helped the brand deliver a quarterly revenue record increasing 74% versus the prior year to $178 million, as we continued to see strong brand momentum and incredible consumer adoption. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.2%, 170-basis-point improvement, driven by improved full price selling, a higher proportion of DTC business and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and transportation cost. SG&A for the quarter was $244 million or 43.5% of sales versus last year's $176 million or 47% of sales. The increase in spend was primarily driven by variable spend related to the increased revenue, as well as additional marketing, performance-related compensation and other items. These results demonstrate another exceptional quarter as we continue to see consumers seeking out our diverse offering of compelling products across our portfolio of brands. With the strength of the fourth quarter, our full fiscal year 2021 revenue came in at $2.546 billion, representing an increase of 19% versus the prior year. Performance as compared to the prior year was again driven by growth in the HOKA and UGG brands, as HOKA increased 62% over the prior year to $571 million with strength across all global regions and channels of distribution and UGG increased 13% over the prior year to $1.717 billion with growth of the U.S. offsetting international declines. Across our entire portfolio of brands, DTC was the primary driver of growth, increasing 45% over last year due to the strength of our online business, which overcame declines in the retail channel related to the pandemic. Gross margins for the year were up 220 basis points over last year to 54%. The increase in gross margin rate was related to 90 basis points from favorable channel mix, 80 basis points from lower promotional activity, including a reduction of closeouts, favorable brand mix as HOKA increased as a percentage of the total company and favorable foreign currency exchange rates with offsets coming from higher freight expense. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $870 million, up 14% from last year's $766 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by increased marketing to capitalize on momentum in our brands and begin to see localized marketing for international UGG, increased warehouse and logistics cost related to the compensation, as well as safety measures in place to protect our employees, increased spend on our e-commerce infrastructure to support the growth of that channel with offsets from lower retail store expense and travel savings that resulted from the pandemic. For the year, our tax rate was 23.7%, which compares to 19% last year. Taxes were higher this year as a result of a higher proportion of domestic revenue, as well as certain discrete items recognized in Q4. This all resulted in a record diluted earnings per share of $13.47 for the year, which compares to $9.62 in the fiscal year 2020. The more than $3 increase as compared to last year was driven by revenue growth in the HOKA and UGG brands, SG&A leverage as revenue growth exceeded expense growth, a greater mix of DTC revenue, a higher percentage of full price sales across our portfolio of brands, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, which was slightly offset by a higher tax rate. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2021, we ended fiscal year 2021 with $1.089 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $278 million, down 11% from $312 million at the same time last year and due to the repayment in full of our corporate headquarter mortgage we had no outstanding borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital above 30%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $99 million worth of shares at an average price of $322.87. I would note that for the majority of the year, we had paused share repurchase activity, as we shifted focus to preserving the strength of our balance sheet based on uncertainty related to the pandemic. Typically, at this point in the year, we would provide an update to our global backlog. Over the last few years, we have continued to signal that less and less emphasis should be placed on backlog as an indicator of future performance. Due to the evolution of our portfolio of brands and distribution strategies, as such we will no longer be providing backlog. Moving to our outlook, for fiscal year 2022, as Dave and I have touched on, fiscal 2021 was a year of full of unique circumstances, some of which directly benefited our brands. Beside just from the long-term evolution of Deckers, fiscal 2022 was thoughtfully planned to bolster the strong foundation already in place and set the table for sustained revenue and earnings power. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect a year-over-year topline growth rate of mid-to-high-teens leading to revenue in the range of $2.95 billion to $3 billion with HOKA growing in the 40% range, reaching an $800 million milestone; UGG growing in the high single digits to low double-digit range driven by domestic wholesale strength and international returning to growth; Koolaburra growing in the low double-digit range; Teva growing in the mid-single digit range; and Sanuk approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 53.3%, which is 70 basis points lower than FY 2021, due to increased shipping cost for ocean containers and air usage, unfavorable product mix shifting toward lower price items, potential channel mix headwinds related to the wholesale filling for the UGG and distributor growth in HOKA and inflationary pressures. SG&A is expected to be approximately 35.5% of revenue, as we made key investments to drive long-term growth and fuel near-term opportunities with variable spend. Strategic spending to drive the evolution of Deckers includes investment in our supply chain and logistics infrastructure to increase capacity with an additional distribution center in U.S., larger facilities internationally and improved planning tools to drive efficiencies, investment to further our digital transformation through added e-commerce capabilities to increase personalization and added analytical tools to optimize data insights and returns on marketing investments, investment in China to seed the HOKA opportunity and reignite UGG brand heat in the region, and investment to bolster our talent across the organization as we scale larger and enable emerging opportunities with added capabilities. Variable spending to fuel near-term opportunities include digital content creation to drive DTC conversion, targeted digital marketing to acquire new consumers, investments to drive growth in UGG ready-to-wear and build awareness of HOKA appear. Our expense and gross margin guidance represents an expected operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which aligns with our commitment to remain top tier among our peers. This targeted operating margin for FY 2022 represents meaningful expansion when compared to pre-pandemic years, where we had consistently achieved an operating margin of approximately 16% in FY 2019 and FY 2020. This demonstrates that we are flowing through a portion of recent margin expansion achieved in FY 2021 that we intend to preserve as we step into FY 2022. These include 90 basis points of channel mix with a larger proportion of DTC business, 50 basis points of brand mix as our mix of HOKA increases and expecting our rate of full price selling to be similar to that experienced in FY 2021. We are also projecting a tax rate of approximately 23%, all resulting in expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.05 to $14.65. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, representing a step up on recent years as we support the build out of a new distribution center in the U.S. and further reinforce our digital transformation through added IT infrastructure. Our fiscal 2022 guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact for additional share repurchase. We will not be providing formal quarterly guidance as the environment remains highly uncertain with regional differences in the pace and scope of economic recovery from the pandemic, as well as continued disruption across the entire supply chain as a result of the pandemic. In addition, with significantly lower inventory in the channel, the normal order and delivery pattern has shifted this year with a greater increase expected in the first half, further complicating expected timing of delivery. Therefore, it is important to note that a focus on a full year guidance best represents a holistic view of how we are driving full year long-term targets. For further context on how we are looking at the first half of the year, we expect strong global wholesale growth from both UGG and HOKA as both brands lap disruption in the channel from last year, and UGG benefits from earlier wholesale orders to fill in depleted inventories. Continued expansion of global HOKA direct-to-consumer as the brand acquires new consumers online through increased awareness and more consumers migrate online for replenishment. Higher marketing cost to keep UGG top of mind with consumers as less people are working from home, as well as a step up in our investment in localized content for international regions. Higher marketing costs for HOKA as the brand increases its presence at events with the world opening up, as well as increased spend to begin building awareness in China. Increased spend on people as we build our workforce and lap some savings experienced last year due to hiring and merit freeze. Elevated warehouse and logistics cost to support the increased scale of business both domestically and internationally with continued safety measures in place. And higher freight costs continuing to be a drag on gross margins. Overall, we anticipate first half revenue will represent a larger percentage of the full year revenue than in prior years. And finally, on capital allocation, with the build of our cash balance over the last year, we completed a thorough review of our strategy. Based on our goal to drive shareholder value, the Board of Directors has approved an increase of $750 million to the company's share repurchase authorization. This increased authorization in conjunction with higher capital expenditure investments supporting our key initiatives highlights the Board's confidence and management's ability to achieve our strategic plan and drive shareholder value while maintaining strength in liquidity. Deckers will maintain a competitive position versus peers, based on growing multiple brands in our portfolio, including one of the fastest growing footwear brands in HOKA, evolving our channel distribution with the long-term goal of reaching a 50% mix of DTC, achieving top tier levels of profitability and leadership in ESG space as we seek to do business in the right way by making positive contributions to our communities and the world at large. To close, I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to managing through tough circumstances to deliver record results in an unprecedented year. I am excited for the years ahead as we invest behind the evolution of Deckers and capitalize on our strong portfolio of brands. Thanks, everyone and I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yeah. Let me -- thanks, Camilo. Good question. What we're seeing and I'll take a step back to just to kind of explain what's going on. I think with inventories low, our own inventory again down 11% and lower inventories as you mentioned kind of lower in the channel. We do want to bring in more inventory in the first couple of quarters and we do want to get it out to our wholesale customers, so that they have it in stock and on shelves during the prime selling season. So that is the shift from what we normally see. It may limit, I would say, the chase opportunities. That's why we're seeing kind of a more robust first half. I think that's why it was important to talk about kind of that first half context, because we're going to see a significant portion of that growth as we expect to fulfill those wholesale orders really in the first half as we bring inventory in. So we were replenishing our depleted inventory and we're getting out to our wholesale accounts sooner, so that they have it in stock. So we will see, again, it's one of the challenges that we're dealing with. As you know, there is significant disruption in the whole supply chain channel, another reason to try to get this inventory in earlier, so that we can avoid some of that disruption. Yeah. And I think just to add on to that, Camilo, It's more than just a one-year investment. So, as Dave said, we've kind of targeted a range that we think is appropriate that kind of balances the investment, as well as what it can drive in sustainable growth, both from a revenue and earnings perspective. And yeah, there are some things that we'll be able to look at once these investments are in place to see what we can then leverage. But, I think, as Dave said, we need to make these investments now, let's see how they go and then we'll be in a better position down the road as to kind of figuring out how we could benefit from some of these investments. Yeah. And then, Jon, just on the kind of the leverage that we talked about kind of from a two-year stack. So, clearly, what we're passing through is some benefit that we've seen in 2021. So as Dave kind of mentioned, we benefited by an acceleration of revenue and didn't necessarily spend against that revenue acceleration in FY 2021. So in 2022, there will be a bit of that catch-up to spend against really a two-year stack of high-teen revenue growth that we believe sets the foundation for more growth. In reference in my prepared remarks, where I talked about how we've progressed from where we were, say two years ago, we're taking some of that leverage that we achieved in 2021 and really passing it through in 2022 as we've seen some of those efficiencies. So it's some of the full price selling, there is going to be some on talent from where we were, say two years ago and so that's where we start to settle down from a proportion of SG&A spend to revenue in that, call it, roughly kind of 35%, 35.5% range. So, again, to the earlier question also, let's see how things go, this is a year where we're coming off the heels of strong revenue growth. We constrained some of that spend in 2022. We think it's important that we get back to making those investments that are setting us up for continuing this growth that we're seeing. And I think, Jay, just to add on to that, what we're seeing and we had the question on the wholesale distribution. So as Dave said, we're seeing tremendous progress within our wholesale distribution. As Dave also said, what we're seeing is an acceleration of units. Now you don't necessarily see that in the same proportion on revenue, because much of our internationals is through distributors. So when we think about HOKA, and as Dave said, approaching $800 million faster than we previously thought clearly $1 billion in our sites, a lot of opportunity. One, as we bring more customers through our direct channels, we're seeing higher adoption through direct-to-consumer channel. On the international front, the investments that we're making will drive greater acceleration of growth on the international front. And then we have a channel opportunity that we can think about kind of down the road. So, clearly, very excited about the potential of HOKA and where it can go, and we're sitting in the very great place. It's going to be spread out. Some of it needs to ramp, right? So you will see it a little bit in disproportion to the revenue growth. So we're going to see more revenue growth upfront as we're filling in the wholesale channels. We're going to be ramping investments really throughout the year. So, more revenue growth on the front half of ramping of investments really over the year. Yeah. And I think the other challenge, Sam, is we had such a strong Q3, Q4 that when you look at the comparison 2022 to 2021, right? We're going to be comparing against some very strong quarters in the back half. So when you think about percentage growth, it's really front half loaded in those terms, especially as we're trying to fill that wholesale channel earlier this year. Hi, Jim. Yeah. Yeah. So I understand the question. Those are all questions that we are needling on a constant basis with our ELT and Board. All of those are opportunities. I think that the $800 million and the $1 billion number does not require the take backs of distributors at this point. I think that's a further out opportunity for us that requires a right level of investment in infrastructure for us to be able to do that correctly. But it's not necessary for us to hit these short-term targets. The longer term targets, that along with outsized growth from where we are today in China down the road expanded categories, apparel potential, you can see that there is a multi-billion dollar brand down the road at some point. Yeah. And Paul -- and what I would say on the whole supply chain channel disruption is it's not unique to us. This is something as you see right in the news everyone's experiencing. I think what -- we're in a better position than many of our peers, because last year we didn't cut back our orders as dramatically as many of our peers did, and as a result of that, we're in a better position with our factories. So as we're ramping up inventory into the year, we feel we're in a better position, still going to confront constraints and disruption. But we think we're better positioned than most, given how, as Dave said, we navigated last year. But still very mindful of what we're dealing with. Yeah. Good question. And as we think about FY 2022 and we think about the ramping of investments, clearly, we're coming, as I said earlier, in a position where revenue was coming in faster than we could spend against it to build infrastructure. So I think to Sam's question earlier, we do see investments ramping in the year. So bringing new talent in is going to take time, putting up some of the infrastructure will take a little bit of time. But there are some upfront costs that we're incurring in the year. So as we think about those aspects, again, you'll see a build in the year related to that. In marketing, we are doing more marketing upfront... ... this year, because we want to continue to fuel that demand that's in the marketplace. So you'll see some of the marketing increased investments in the first half of the year. So it's a bit of a mixed bag if you look at the whole year. So -- but generally speaking, it takes some time to build that investment. So generally speaking, you will see a bit of a ramp. But there are components that we're going to spend more aggressively in the first half. Yeah. I think the, again, not giving guidance, but when you think about the percentage growth for the year, again, as I said earlier on the Q&A, where we will be lapping very strong Q3 and Q4. The majority of our -- large majority of our percentage revenue growth will be occurring, as we expect, if things go according to plan in that first half. But again, as Dave said, there is a lot of moving pieces. There is a lot of -- still as we're rebuilding inventory, trying to get that inventory in time and then turned around at our DC. It's also working with wholesalers to have them take product earlier. I think we're in a relatively good place where they are rebuilding their inventory levels as well, so if things play out as we see it, right, that will create much stronger growth on a percentage terms in the first half. Now some of that can drift, again, which is why we don't want to give guidance yet because we have a lot of shipping that goes out in those final two weeks of quarters, which is kind of the way it lands. So things can move relatively easy between quarters. Yeah. I'll take the last one first. No. We do not. Not at this stage or this year. We are looking at this way. And then in terms of domestic versus international, we don't really break that out. Other than to say, just to give a little bit of color on the half year, I'll say, a little bit more growth on HOKA in the front half, again, as we lap bigger quarters in the back half, again, on percentage terms."

I'm excited to dive into the details of an extraordinary quarter for the company and the exceptional results that our teams have delivered. But first, I would again like to stress the paramount importance of the health and safety of our employees, customers, communities and stakeholders, as they remain top of mind with everyone continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of Deckers, I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Our third quarter results include record setting revenue of $1.078 billion and record earnings per share of $8.99. Revenue grew by 15% over last year's third quarter to deliver Deckers\u2019 first ever quarter to exceed $1 billion. Performance in the quarter was driven by delivering relevant and compelling product that consumers are demanding, focusing execution to maximize demand captured through direct-to-consumer channels, engaging consumers with authentic in a modern of product storytelling, executing marketplace management that set the table for high product sell-through and our dedicated employees working tirelessly to deliver strong results, despite the challenging environment. To achieve these results, we overcame both significant operational hurdles as well as macro pressures related to the ongoing pandemic. Steve will be providing more contexts on these unique dynamics later in today's call. We believe much of the strength we have seen in our business fiscal year to date is a result of our continued execution and dedication to our long-term strategies, including driving year-round demand for us through a diverse product assortment, accelerating consumer acquisition online, which increased 87% year-to-date across our portfolio of brands, prioritizing 18- to 34-year-old consumers, which have accounted for the largest percentage increase in our U.S. customer database this year, managing the wholesale marketplace strategically, which has continued to benefit UGG men's in the U.S. and it's progressing in EMEA, globalizing the HOKA ecosystem evidenced by the acceleration of international markets and spending responsibly to maintain high levels of profitability while deploying investments in these key strategic areas. While this last year has led to unique circumstances, allowing our brands to capitalize on positive momentum, our underlying strategies remain central to Deckers\u2019 long-term growth and profitability profile. As we adapt our operating model to these accelerated trends, we continue to recognize the need for additional infrastructure investments, allowing us to sustain strengthen our business. More to share on that front during our year-end earnings call in May. I'll now walk you through the brand highlights from the quarter, starting with UGG. The double-digit global UGG growth rate in the third quarter was driven by the strength of the brands diversified and compelling product offering, which has been embraced by a broader range of consumers, momentum with younger and fashion-forward consumers, targeted digital marketing and PR activations, increased purchase frequency from consumers shopping across multiple product categories, significant brand heat in the U.S. with strong selling and sell-through across multiple wholesale accounts paired with exceptional DTC engagement, and traction with localized strategies for international markets beginning to rebuild brand heat within Europe and Asia. The UGG brand success, particularly in the U.S. is the result of the brand's long-term evolution as a leading global lifestyle brand through infusing brand DNA into new and expanding categories. More specifically, over the past four years, UGG has established an impressive resume of collaborations that have helped rebuild the brand fashion credibility. This includes recently announced collaborations with British designer, Molly Goddard, and New York based designer, Telfar Clemens. Combining buzzworthy collaborations, design innovation, and strategically managed distribution through product allocations, segmentation and differentiation, UGG has significantly reduced its reliance on core products while significantly expanding other categories. Evidencing the success of this strategy during the third quarter, women's Classic product volume remained flat year-over-year, while the brand experienced growth across every other major category, including women's non-Classic footwear highlighted by slippers and the Fluff franchise, men's footwear, particularly in the Neumel franchise inherited slippers, kids' footwear through fund variations of popular men's and women's product, and the new ready-to-wear collection, which was a resounding success this season and will be expanded upon next fall with additional products and partnerships. With this transformation beyond core products, the UGG consumer is becoming younger and more diverse. During the third quarter, UGG experienced a 44% increase in customers aged 18- to 34-year-old in the U.S., which was the largest increase of any group and represented the largest percentage of total customers. As UGG continues to expand its audience with younger consumers, it\u2019s been critical to enhance the brand\u2019s e-commerce engine and digital marketing expertise. The UGG e-commerce platform has continued to evolve as part of Deckers\u2019 overall digital transformation, but it has also become a strategic driver of the product development process through exclusive products. By creating products exclusive to DTC, the UGG team is able to both develop special events that drive traffic as well as create a faster feedback loop to enhance future product success with targeted consumers. Momentum with younger consumers has been amplified by UGG earning year-round attention from the emergence of the Fluff franchise. Historically many consumers search for UGG products as weather turned colder. However, with the evolution of Fluff, which features year-round product, UGG is remaining top of mind with consumers. In fact, UGG brand search interest increased 18% for the entire calendar year 2020. We have also observed Fluff as a compelling acquisition vehicle for driving repurchase decisions in other categories. Specifically, our data highlighted many consumers who purchased Fluff earlier this year, returning to purchase the Classic Clear Mini this fall. With more frequent attention from consumers and effective utilization of consumer insights and data analysis, over the last nine months, we've witnessed an 89% increase in repeat purchasers as compared to the same period last year. With more consumers making multiple purchases, the value of the more than 2 million new customers acquired so far this year, it becomes even more impactful for the future growth trajectory of the UGG brand. As the UGG customer database grows, so does the strength of its insights provided by our centralized marketing teams. For example, consumer insights revealed that 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. were the driving factor behind the Neumel becoming a top global style for UGG in the third quarter. While volume growth of the style was impressive, even more exciting was the increase in 18- to 34-year-old purchasers of the Neumel, more than doubled over last year in our domestic DDC channel. With the insights developed around the Neumel consumer, we believe that the recently introduced men's Fluff product will also resonate well with this consumer. First launch in November, the men's Fluff It and Fluff You styles were modeled by NBA legend, Dennis Rodman, in the UGG brand\u2019s Chaotic Fun campaign. The UGG team is excited by the positive PR impressions gained from men's Fluff, which sold out in its initial allocation online and it's selling well with key wholesale partners. From a regional standpoint as expected, growth in the third quarter was driven by the U.S. Where according to YouGov, UGG agreed new all time highs in brand consideration, purchase intent, brand impression, and brand buzz among women aged 18 to 34. Over the past three years, the UGG brand\u2019s domestic business has added nearly $200 million to the third quarter alone, which we feel is a result of our successful strategy to build brand heat and tightly manage our segmentation and diversification efforts. While a great deal of the domestic strength this year has been driven by owned e-commerce performance, and this continued in the third quarter, pairs sold to UGG domestic wholesale partners during the fall season increased 42% versus last year. Because of the UGG marketplace strategy, wholesale success was broad-based. Given the strength of our sell-through at our wholesale partners this fall, UGG experienced very little promotional activity and season ending inventories in the market are at a historically low level. Internationally, UGG continues to see progress in the multi-year reset in EMEA. Over the last year, UGG has exited approximately 20% of wholesale accounts in Europe and significantly reduced the core Classic product in the marketplace. While revenue in Europe remained a strategic headwind in Q3 due to our ongoing marketplace reset and COVID-related challenges, margins improved as UGG drove a healthier product mix and reduced the need for promotional activity. Overall, we feel the UGG brand is headed in a positive direction in Europe, evidenced by fiscal year-to-date, online consumer acquisition increasing 97% over last year. With favorable consumer acquisition and strengthened strategic youth accounts in the region, we believe UGG could return to growth in EMEA next fiscal year. With the holiday season behind us, we are now shifting our focus towards growing brand heat and consumer attention for the spring and summer seasons. Clearly the strategy we have implemented over the past few years in the U.S. continues to pay dividends, and we are excited by this year's progress with international markets. We still have investments to make in order to rebuild brand heat in these international regions, but feel increasingly positive that our strategy to build diversified product acceptance through fashion credibility is working. Congratulations to the UGG team on executing a fantastic quarter. Shifting to HOKA, global performance was driven by strength in momentum across the brand's entire ecosystem. Among all access points, building the brand\u2019s online consumer acquisition and retention has been a primary focus for HOKA. Through optimized digital marketing and geo-targeting, HOKA has managed to increase consumer acquisition online by 117% fiscal year-to-date, while also doubling consumer retention year-over-year. With a growing audience online and dedicated consumer replenishment trends, HOKA has been able to cross the $100 million DDC revenue mark in just the first nine months of fiscal year 2021. With this acceleration online, DDC revenue now represents nearly 30% of HOKA revenue fiscal year-to-date, up from 21% last year. Importantly, HOKA is also firing on all cylinders with wholesale partners as the brand has doubled both awareness and consideration among consumers outside of core runners. According to the NPD Group's retail tracking service, HOKA dollar sales in the U.S. run specialty channel increased 19% for the three months ending December 2020 compared to the same months over the prior year. This growth is despite overall dollar sales of adult running shoes sold through this channel decreasing 4% for the three months ending December 2020. For calendar year 2020, the brand\u2019s top three strategic wholesale accounts sold more than $100 million of HOKA product at retail value, highlighting both the strength of these relationships and the relative size of the HOKA brand\u2019s direct-to-consumer business. As we have discussed in the past, we are constantly evaluating HOKA distribution to ensure optimized consumer access points. Earlier this year, we began testing DICK'S Sporting Goods with the limited number of doors and product. And so far, the partnership has been mutually beneficial. This spring HOKA will be slowly increasing its door count with DICK'S, and we'll continue to evaluate as appropriate. Ideally, testing these additional access points for HOKA will expose the brand to a larger audience as we work to build further awareness and consideration. During the quarter, HOKA growth was powerful across the globe in every region. And we have been encouraged to see the brand\u2019s international growth rate continued to outpace domestic. While revenue dynamics remain in favor of domestic due to the differences in distribution models, 54% of units in Q3 were sold internationally. This speaks to the HOKA brand\u2019s global appeal and opportunity overseas as the brand expands. From a product standpoint, HOKA continues to be recognized with awards for its innovative technology and designs. Some of the awards received during the third quarter include the Clifton Edge being named Best Running Shoes in The Rolling Stone Essentials 2020. The BONDI 7 being named Best for Long Runs in Outside magazine's Best Running Shoes of 2021 Winter Guide. And the HOKA, GORE-TEX Shakedry Run Jacket being named Best Running Jacket in the 2021 Women's Health Fitness awards. We are proud to see not only core heritage HOKA products like the BONDI receiving recognition, but also new product innovations like the Clifton Edge and Shakedry Run Jacket, obtaining a claim. We are still in the very infancy of HOKA apparel, but it's promising to see such a positive response so early in the development process. On the innovation front, HOKA has been working to bolster its fly collection, which represents the brand's roster of speed shoes. We believe these lead with speed shoes are an important acquisition vehicle for younger consumers. And I'm excited to share some of the HOKA brands\u2019 recent and upcoming launches in the category, including the Rocket X which launched in Q3, the Carbon X2 which launched in January, and the Mach 4 which launches in March. Similar to the original Carbon X that was worn by Jim Walmsley while setting a new world record 50 mile time in 2019, the X2 was launched with a world record breaking 100,000 attempt. While Jim was a few seconds shy of the world record this time, he shattered the American record and it was an incredible event to showcase the brand.  We know Jim will be back for more record-breaking attempts and believe this event further demonstrates the global opportunity that lies ahead for HOKA and our supporting athletes. Congratulations to Jim with this incredible achievement and thank you for showing us what is possible with HOKA performance. We believe that with continued innovation in the speed space, we'll continue to build awareness with consumers aged 18 to 34 and main consumer acquisition momentum, which fiscal year to-date has increased 167% versus last year in the 18 to 34 year old demographic in the U.S. With just under $400 million in revenue fiscal year-to-date, we're confident HOKA will cross the $500 million revenue milestone for fiscal year 2021. We look forward to sharing more around the HOKA growth path on our year-end earnings call in May. With respect to channel performance. In the third quarter, e-commerce growth was exceptional, helping to drive our mix of DTC revenue to 48% up from 44% last year. This is despite declines in retail and growth in the wholesale channel. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 34% versus last year, approximately 75% of our own retail stores were open for the entire third quarter, although in most cases with limited capacity due to enhanced health and safety protocols. In total global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 26% versus last year's third quarter.  Performance was driven by consumer acquisition online, partially offset by a deceleration of retail resulting from macro-pandemic pressures on store traffic. Global wholesale revenue in the third quarter increased 6% as compared to last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by global HOKA and domestic UGG. With offsets from international UGG related to marketplace reset initiatives underway. In summary global demand for HOKA, domestic strengthened UGG, omni-channel execution and disciplined approach to strategic investment and an incredible display of resiliency by our employees operationally led Deckers to double-digit quarterly revenue and earnings growth in the midst of a pandemic.  On behalf of the entire leadership team. thank you to all of our employees across the globe. Your relentless result in getting the job done delivered these record results. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details in our third quarter financial performance, as well as some additional thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard Decker's third quarter performance was incredibly strong and speaks well to the success of our strategies driving demand for our brands. While this year has been full of unique circumstances, our performance has been enabled by the work we have undertaken to transform Deckers to a digitally-led organization with strategically managed distribution channels and innovative product creation that consumers demand. I am proud of our organization's ability to effectively manage our resources, overcome operational obstacles, manage with financial discipline and achieve exceptional results in the face of adversity. I am confident that as we move forward and beyond the pandemic, our brands and organization are positioned to emerge with continued growth opportunities, strength and discipline. Before moving into our results for the quarter, I would like to start with a little context. Back on our second quarter earnings call, we laid out a number of tailwinds experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. These tailwinds included compelling products that are resonating with consumers in the current environment, accelerated adoption of e-commerce, our brands benefiting from consumer trends shifting toward casualization as people continue to work from home and heightened awareness of HOKA. With the results we just delivered, we were able to capitalize on these variables in the third quarter as well. We also discussed some potential headwinds that we anticipated could impact the third quarter as we stepped into our peak season. To quickly summarize, the assumed challenges were the potential for both owned and third-party shipping constraints. A second wave pandemic impact on operations. Limitations resulting from inventory purchase reductions at the onset of the pandemic. And finally higher shipping and warehouse costs related to increased safety and hazard pay as well as increased marketing costs to capitalize on brand momentum. And I am pleased to say that through some advanced planning early in the quarter, hard work on the part of our employees, close partnership with many of our accounts and a dedicated consumer base, we were able to mitigate much of the anticipated impact. More specifically, actions taken to address these headwinds were to bring on incremental shipping capacity with additional partners. Create greater utilization of DC by-passed shipments to wholesale customers, implement effective safety measures that helped limit our own retail store closures and allowed shipping to remain operational at our California distribution center for the duration of the quarter. In some cases shift consumer demand for out of stock items to other available products and a measured approach to managing spent during the quarter. Overall, the net impact of these factors helped to drive our exceptional results for the quarter. And our business was aided by demand that drove much stronger revenue than anticipated. Now for financial specifics, revenue in the third quarter was $1.078 billion up 15% versus the prior year. Performance as compared to last year was primarily driven by global UGG growth of 12% to $877 million, which was fueled by a domestic increase of 20%, partially offset by the continued international reset, but worth noting that we saw improving signs throughout the quarter. And global HOKA growth of 52% to $142 million, which experienced an 92% increase in DTC and a 40% increase with wholesale.  Gross margins in the third quarter were up 290 basis points over last year to 57%. The increase in gross margin was related to the strong full-price selling environment of UGG as demand far outweighed supply, helping significantly limit any promotional activity. Favorable channel mix as DTC increased as a proportion of the total business. Very limited wholesale close outs as demand outpaced supply for many styles and benefits from favorable exchange rates during the quarter. SG&A dollar spend was $285.2 million, up 13% from last year's $251.9 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by variable marketing, warehouse and logistic costs, and performance-based compensation partially offset by savings from lower travel and retail expenses. This all resulted in record earnings per share of $8.99 which compares to $7.14 in last year's third quarter. The $1.85 improvement versus last year, again was driven by increased revenue volume seen from the growth in UGG and HOKA brands, a higher proportion of full-priced UGG revenue and a higher mix of DTC revenue, favorable currency rates and SG&A leverage in the quarter as revenue accelerated much faster than expenses, with some offsets from greater spend on marketing, warehouse, and performance-based compensation, as well as the combined impacts of a higher tax rate and higher share count. Our year-to-date performance has delivered significant operating margin expansion in comparison to the same period last year. This has been driven by factors including, DTC mix increasing significantly, with the acceleration of our e-commerce business and while we still anticipate growth going forward, the magnitude of the shift is not anticipated to continue. A historically low promotional environment, resulting from very high demand, significantly minimizing, both discounting and close outs. And temporary operating expense savings with discretionary constraints employed early in the year at the onset of the pandemic. With these benefits partially offset by rising freight expense, that could go higher in the future and our strategic investment in marketing that we intend to continue fueling going forward. For the quarter our tax rate was 22.2% driven by higher mix of domestic and DTC business. Our balance sheet remains strong and as of December 31, cash and equivalents were $1.157 billion. Inventory was $305 million down 17% from $366 million at the same time last year. And we had no short-term borrowings under our existing credit line as compared to $6 million last year. Our existing credit lines have an available balance of $474 million. During the quarter we did not repurchase any shares. Earlier this year at the onset of the pandemic we paused our share repurchase activity, but now intend to recommence share repurchase under the existing $160 million outstanding authorization in future periods. As we continue to navigate the global pandemic, we will not be providing specific guidance on the fourth quarter, but we do want to highlight a few considerations as we look to finish out the fiscal year.  We expect revenue to grow in comparison to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, more specifically on UGG. We see growth with our domestic business, as we lapped last year's impact of delayed and canceled wholesale orders and physical retail store disruption at the onset of COVID-19. But we continue to expect pressure on our international wholesale business as we are still in the midst of a marketplace reset. And on HOKA, we expect global growth as the brand continues to drive year-round demand and continue to see expectations of annual revenue exceeding the 500 million milestone. Then on costs, with the success we saw in Q3 and an ability to bring increased awareness to our Spring/Summer offerings, we plan to increase our marketing efforts, this will likely result in a significant increase in our marketing spend for the quarter. And as we continue to navigate the global pandemic, we continue to experience higher costs related to logistics and warehouse fulfillment. These include increased safety measures put in place at our distribution center, expedited freight to replenish inventory of depleted in-demand styles and accelerated spend to increased logistics capacity. In addition, with these strong results, we will see higher performance-based compensation costs related to our higher level of performance for the year. Therefore when factoring these considerations in and recognizing that Q4 represents one of our smaller revenue quarters, the spend increase will be disproportionate to revenue, all potentially resulting in a lower earnings per share for the quarter year-over-year, but still delivering strong results for the full year. Before I hand the call back to Dave, I would like to say how pleased we are with our fiscal year-to-date performance. Our teams have done an enviable job managing through operational and macro challenges while ensuring the long-term vision of the organization remains intact. Our brands are full of momentum. The company remains well positioned and we are prepared for the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks everyone. And I'll now turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers : Thanks Steve. To close today's call. I wanted to once again recognize our employees for staying committed to each other and to the success of our company throughout a year filled with uncertainty. I am so appreciative of how our teams rose to the occasion and enabled our brand to deliver exceptional results. Because of this hard work Deckers boast two of the strongest brands in the footwear industry that are both leaders in their respective spaces of fashion and athletic performance. While this year presented challenges and our strategies allowed us to capitalize on certain extraordinary circumstances there is no doubt our brands benefited from a unique consumer environment, where spending patterns shifted away from experiences and into products. As consumers look to brands and products that fit their needs for the current environment, we saw an acceleration of engagement with our brands. And as Steve noted in his comments, we believe the results just delivered will not be sustained at these levels in the longer run. As we return to a more normal environment and invest in our brand to continue to deliver growth globally. We will provide more insights regarding these investments on our fourth quarter call, but I think it's important to note in a year when we saw our accelerated growth, little to no promotion and constrained corporate spending while navigating a global pandemic, these results are exceptional.  At Deckers, we like to say, as our organization performs well, it enables us to do good. With that in mind, we've continued to enhance our ESG programs and increased both our charitable contributions and our employee hours donated well above last year. Doing good and doing great is that the core of Deckers values and is the primary reason behind our leadership in the ESG arena. Moving forward, I have the utmost confidence in our strategies, our portfolio of brands and exemplary operating model that now more than ever give credence to the long-term trajectory of Deckers brands. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Camilo Lyon of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Great job on the results today. Dave, just kind of dovetailing from what you \u2013 on your last comments were, question that we get a lot is how do you \u2013 how do we think that you will lap the strong demand that you've seen in slippers as past year? And how do you pivot away from the work-from-home categories that you've leveraged? Maybe if you could help us understand the categories and how the categories shifted during COVID and how they might shift back when normalization occurs? And then secondarily on gross margin, with HOKA now starting to really gain momentum and the margins of that business reaching scale apparently, how should we think about your long run gross margin outlook when your channel mix stabilizes?\nDave Powers: Yes, thanks, Camilo. Those are great questions. And the strength, first of all, the strength of the quarter in UGG with double-digit growth, which I think we all are excited to see, we haven't seen that in some time, is really driven by a diversified product offering. So it's \u2013 in past years we were talking about how much the Classics drove the business and how important weather was. And as you can tell, we didn't mention either of those specifically in the call and that's because we're seeing broad based success across all the categories in women's, but also in men's and kids and including apparel. Slippers is certainly a driver of the success of the Fluff franchise that continues to grow and provide upside for us, but core heritage slippers as well, such as Tasman and Ansley and Ascot. But Classics, as a core Classics business, whereas it's relatively flat and the growth came from non-Classic boots, such as the Classic Clear, the Ultra Mini and the Neumel. In fact, the Neumel this quarter globally was the number one style across all genders. And in the U.S., the men's Neumel was the number one style for the quarter in U.S. wholesale. So, it's great to see that our diversification efforts are paying off. Certainly there is a level of tailwind from COVID and the work-from-home environment, but what's exciting to see is we are bringing in, as we mentioned, a younger consumer. They're shopping more frequently. We saw consumers come into the franchise in Q2 that purchased on our websites, the Fluff product, but they came back in Q3 and they purchased the Classic Clear. And one of the things that I've learned in my tenure at the company here is that once a consumer is in UGG, they're always in UGG, and we're bringing in younger, more diverse consumers than we ever had before. And I think the long-term value of those consumers gives us real competence that if the slipper trend does continue \u2013 start to wane or the tailwind from COVID and work-from-home slows down a little bit, we have new consumers that have now fallen in love with brand in a different way than our prior consumers that were just for the Classic and went on occasion. It's much more fashionable now. Obviously, the collabs and the brand heat and the press that we're getting globally is putting us in a new light. We're now seen as a global fashion lifestyle brand, not just a boot brand. And I think with the innovation that the teams have and how we're evolving the slipper category to not just work-from-home, but from a fashion statement gives me real optimism in that as well. So the brand has never been stronger. I truly believe that. We're seeing demand outpaced supply in Q3. It's broad based across all categories and genders, head to toe, and that momentum we're starting to see in Europe in Asia as well just gives us real confidence that this isn't just a one-time COVID situation. It's a real strength of the brand across broad base. On the HOKA margin question, I'll let Steve answer that. But certainly, the HOKA margin is healthy for us. And as we drive more business online into our e-commerce and DDC channels, both for UGG and HOKA that benefits us. You saw the margin in the quarter, 57%. I believe that's probably an all time high for us in a quarter like this. And that's driven by a combination of full price sell-through at wholesale, and then obviously DDC mix and the strength of HOKA that's laying into that as well. So again, just broad base success gives us real confidence so we can continue down this path going forward. But Steve, do you want to add a little more color?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Camilo, probably just a little bit more color. In terms of, as we think about normalizing on the gross margin, I think in the quarter we saw about a 100 basis points due to promotion. As we think about that going forward, that would normalize. So we wouldn't necessarily see kind of really as much full price selling that we saw in the current quarter. And then we did have a little bit of channel mix and then FX, which is probably about another 100 basis points. And that we would also begin to see normalize as we get into kind of a more normal quarter with more promotion in a normal environment, and then not the FX lift that we saw in the current quarter either.\nDave Powers: Yes. So we're going to do everything we can to maintain these levels of channel mix and continue to drive upside in DTC. But longer term, it's hard to say at this point what the supply chain environment will look like overseas with tariffs and demand and logistics and other things that we'll have to consider. So there will be some headwinds in the future, but trust, we're doing everything we can to maintain healthy levels of margin.\nCamilo Lyon: Great. Thank you for that color. So, Steve, just to clarify, that was 200 basis points in the quarter for the overall, right?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I would say 200 that would \u2013 due to the exceptional quarter that we would attribute, and then \u2013 and it always changes, right, as you think about promotion and how much. But I think the very clean quarter as we talked about in the prepared remarks, definitely contributed at least a 100 basis points. As I said, FX about 50 and then channel mix with the higher proportion of DTC, we would expect some of that to come back as there was a higher proportion of DTC selling in the current quarter.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. And if I could sneak one in, one last one in on HOKA. Dave, I think you said that over half the pairs are sold internationally, but that's not the mix from a dollars perspective.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nCamilo Lyon: So clearly you're using distributors. What's the intention there to either bring those distributors sells to direct or more to a wholesale? How do you think about improving that profitability of those international direct sales?\nDave Powers: Yes. It's nothing to share on that front yet, but trust, it\u2019s something we're taking a good look at longer term. We do believe that when we control markets that serves us better obviously from a margin and also consumer data perspective to have their DTC channel. So we're keeping close eye on that. There's a lot of heavy lifting that's involved in that and we'll share a little more color on investments going forward and to be able to maintain this level of growth. But it's certainly something that we're keeping a close eye on. In longer term, it's a great opportunity.\nCamilo Lyon: Excellent. Congrats again on a great quarter.\nDave Powers: All right. Thanks, Camilo.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Komp of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Hi. Great. Thank you. Maybe just a broader question on UGG to start. Dave, just given all the new customers you've brought into the brand domestically, and then getting past the distribution cleanup in Europe, just any broader stroke thoughts on how large do you think the opportunity here is for UGG as you look out into the future years?\nDave Powers: Yes, I think certainly the inventory levels, if you see how we've ended this quarter and how clean the channel is, that's going to serve us well going into next year and beyond. Like I said, the demand broad base globally is very, very strong. And the strength of what we're seeing now with \u2013 returned to growth in FY 2022 for Europe and then some opportunities that we're seeing in China, we're very optimistic about it. I think one of the things that we're learning and we learned over the last six months is the power of localized marketing efforts. And that's what you're seeing in both Europe and China to be driving adoption of new categories, such as Fluff, resetting the brand from a consumer perspective, and we're going to continue to invest to drive that growth. So we still think there's definitely growth in the UGG brand globally. And when you start looking at these new categories and the strength of men's, which was a driver this past quarter as well as kids and apparel, it's a very exciting proposition going forward.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I think just to add onto that, Jon. The diversity that we saw on a product in Q3 was really impressive.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nSteve Fasching: So UGG had its most diverse selling quarter, probably ever.\nJonathan Komp: And more just near-term on UGG, when \u2013 how do you think about in a marketplace that supplies obviously less than demand for multiple styles? How should we expect that to play out from a wholesale order book perspective? And just thinking of the next fall, what the replenishment factor might look like?\nDave Powers: Yes. We\u2019re obviously not going to share any details of that on this call. We'll have a little more color in the next call. But just as you said, there is great demand out there. And what's impressive about it is it\u2019s diversified across consumer and category by our account segmentation. And the teams have done an amazing job of segmenting our distribution and then supplying them with relevant products. So in the past where everybody was clamoring to get their hands on the Classic, each account now has a different assortment that works for them and we're servicing them more specifically than we ever had before. So that bodes well for the order book. They're seeing new opportunities with younger consumers. And as I said, men\u2019s, when you start looking at folks like Genesco and Foot Locker group, there's great opportunity to expand into new consumers and styles. So at this point that's the best way to look at it, but the demand is certainly very, very strong.\nJonathan Komp: Understood. Appreciate the colors. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to ask about inventory, down a ton. Curious how much of that was planned versus whether you\u2019re might be seeing some supply chain disruption. Is that a function of just stronger sell-throughs? Maybe if you could talk about how you're planning inventory over the next couple of quarters. And then also curious about the HOKA business. If you could give us an update on the apparel initiative, where are you in terms of building the design talent? When should we expect to see a greater emphasis on a push into the apparel category? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yes, you bet, Paul. So on the inventory side, the intentional side of this was on the international regions. We talked about with the transformation of the European market cleaning up their inventory, creating more of a pull model, particularly in Classics. So our inventory levels were expected to come down and there that the strength of the brand and the demand helped us get there faster than we anticipated, but that was by design. And then also in Asia, specifically, China cleaning up the channel there as well. So those were work of the teams in those regions. We\u2019re focused on anticipating, but the demand helped us accelerate that even further. Steve, I'll let you comment on the total company.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So Paul, kind of as we saw total company down, it was really all brands except for HOKA. HOKA\u2019s inventory was up. But as you would expect with the brand growing kind of over 50%, trying to just keep pace with that growth is a challenge. I think from an inventory perspective, as Dave said, lower than what we thought, but helped us kind of chase incremental sales. Going forward, there are still disruptions in the supply chain. So we'll be working to bring inventory kind of as quickly as we can as we continue to see demand. So that'll be an area that we're working very closely with our suppliers, really to make sure that we're getting inventory in. So as we've depleted it, as we've seen inventory levels in the channel significantly lower, it's a big focus of our supply chain to manage that inventory and manage that incoming inventory. So pleased with the position, but also know it's lower than what we expected and so how do we replenish it really going forward.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I think it gives us a great opportunity to kind of reset in the channel. And I know the teams are working on that. It also allows us to get orders in earlier which will help with our supply chain in our production going into this year, which we know will be challenging, but we're getting ahead of that because of the current situation. But it allows us to really set the channel the way we want it to be and to maintain the strengths and then the positioning of the brand and control it better by distribution type, whether it's DTC or wholesale or depending on the account in wholesale. So it's an enviable position for us to be in and we're going to take advantage of it as best we can. On the HOKA side, what we said before still holds true. We see this as a $1 billion brand with footwear doing the majority of that business and we're still focused on that. Wendy, the President of the HOKA brand, myself and the rest of the LT are evaluating the apparel opportunity. We do believe longer term that this is a significant opportunity for us, but you're looking two to three years out before it has a real meaningful impact. But we want to do it right. We want to make sure that we do hire the right design talent to your point, and that we have the operational and distribution tactics in place to be able to do it in a quality way. We're known for the innovation and the bold approach to footwear. And we need to have the right design talent and supply chain to be able to do that also in apparel and it's something that we're very excited about. And as we talk about investments going forward, apparel, not just in HOKA, but also in UGG is going to be a key area of investment for us over the next couple of years.\nPaul Lejuez: Got you. Thanks. Just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the UGG business within China to what you're seeing there in terms of what's working, what's not? How you feel about the marketing? And how you plan to invest in that region over the next couple of quarters?\nDave Powers: Yes, that's a great question. A year ago \u2013 two years ago now actually, a year has gone by so fast, Stefano, our Leader of Omnichannel, Andrea, the President of the UGG brand, and the leadership team involved with China and then the brand here, put a plan in place to transform that business. It was traditionally a Classics driven approach or business there. It still is for an enlarged part, but with the focus on localized marketing, on utilizing local influencers, creating excitement around the Fluff franchise and other fashionable styles, such as the UGG Classic Clear, which blew out in no time in China, we're starting to see a turnaround in that business. And again, it's beyond the Classic, it's new, fresh exciting styles from a fashion perspective. The impression of the brand is improving based on the localized marketing efforts and the influencers that we're using there. And this quarter was successful from an inventory cleanup, both for ourselves and our partners over there, which again allows us to set the channel going into FY 2022 the way we want to see it and make sure that we're still driving healthy full price sales at a diversified offering. And we're confident that we continue on that path, but it is going to take investment. And as Steve mentioned in the script, we're starting to reinvest in this quarter, Q4. We were a shy in investment last year for obvious reasons. But now in Q4 and going in FY 2022, China is going to be a pretty significant focus for us in investments, not just in UGG, in marketing, but also to get HOKA off the ground in a real meaningful way.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser of Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Yes, I changed my name to yours, Dave.\nDave Powers: I like that.\nSam Poser: Happy New Year. A couple of questions. Number one, how should we think \u2013 I mean, given the clean inventory and everything else, and the way of the momentum of these brands, should we consider the gross margin in the fourth quarter to have a similar year-over-year increase in basis points. And then the same question with SG&A. You said the SG&A is going to be elevated. Is that going to be in line sort of with the percent change we saw in Q3? Or is that going to be higher than that?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I'll take that, Sam, first. So on the SG&A, it's going to be more, right. Because we've been holding back really kind of through the pandemic as Dave just said. And even as we've looked at marketing, now I think with the success that we're seeing with the brands, the need to invest more.\nDave Powers: And to drive spring business as well.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So we're looking at how you can drive an increased kind of spring-summer business year-over-year. And that is contributing to a disproportionate increase in the SG&A spend in Q4. So again, haven't given full guidance, but expect that to be seen in Q4. Then on the gross margins, I would not extrapolate what we saw in Q3 from a gross margin perspective year-over-year into Q4. I think some of the tailwinds that we saw in Q3 were much bigger than what we would anticipate in Q4. So I wouldn't necessarily increase Q4 gross margins like you saw in Q3. We won't be getting \u2013 we'll get some, but not the extent that you saw in Q3.\nDave Powers: And I would say from an investment standpoint in SG&A, we do have \u2013 we believe we have a significant opportunity in spring and summer business, particularly for the UGG brand that's obvious than HOKA, but we want to take advantage of this time right now with the momentum in that brand to really drive success in spring and summer this quarter. Obviously we're looking at the full-year results, which will be exceptional based on Q3. But we want to make sure that we're continuing to invest to drive opportunities for the long-term.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then lastly, just some housekeeping stuff. Could you give us either the wholesale or the direct-to-consumer by brand either the absolute dollars for Teva, UGG, Sanuk, HOKA and so on, please?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Okay. So wholesale sales in Q3 for UGG call it $408.9 million, HOKA was call it $101 million, wholesale Teva was $12.1 million, Sanuk was $3.8 million and this is in millions and then other brands was $32.2 million. \nDave Powers: And then you can back into DTC.\nSam Poser: Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nDave Powers: Okay. Sure. Thanks Sam. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Nikic of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So when I look at UGG for the quarter and then I guess beyond, I know you said UGG growing, but I was wondering if you could contextualize that a little bit. It would seem between the easy compare, the brand momentum, the channel inventories being extremely low, like you talked about on the call, which would give an opportunity for some restocking, the strength in the fluff, in the spring style. It would seem like this could end up being like a really, really strong UGG quarter. So I was just kind of wondering if you could contextualize a little bit in how you think about it for Q4 and maybe into early FY 2022.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think Tom it's a little bit hard. It's again, why we're not giving guidance. We see opportunity, we're also dealing as I kind of mentioned on the previous question, some supply constraints with bringing inventory in and so forth, so that's affecting Q4. So we're really not in a position to give a lot. We see, clearly it's something like we've said when we were approaching the fall-winter season, the demand is there. The opportunity is there. We still have to manage through kind of inventory, bringing inventory in, expediting inventory. And that's really why we're not giving kind of more specifics. The opportunity is there for UGG, but there are some constraints in the system as we continue to kind of navigate the current environment. So I would just say, the opportunity to do more is there, but there are other constraints that will provide headwinds against the ability to meet the demand that's out there right now.\nDave Powers: And still a very uncertain environment, we still have store closes in the UK and sporadically across the world. And we're going to be coming into Q1 up against last year's pandemic and that's mixed results based off category and region, and channels. So there's a lot to navigate still, but you can't deny the demand and the strength of the brand at the current time, but we just have to balance that out, the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment.\nTom Nikic: Got it. And just a quick follow-up, Dave when I look at the balance sheet, I see almost $1.2 billion of cash and obviously some good cash generation for the business overall. And I know you said you're looking to restart to the buyback program. Would there be a scenario where M&A would start to become more appetizing to you to have a sort of third leg of the stool so to speak or is that not in the cards right now?\nDave Powers: Yes. Tom, I think it's a good question. And clearly it's we're having a lot of conversation around capital allocation with the cash that we have on hand. Now having our strongest quarter of the year behind us and having an exceptional result for the quarter gives us opportunity to look at a number of things and so that is what we're doing right now. More conversations with management and board in terms of capital allocation, I would say just more to come, but recommencing our share repurchase is a good start to that. \nSteve Fasching: Yes. And I think, listen we have incredible opportunities with organic growth with our brands. And we need to make sure that first and foremost we're executing on that opportunity. And that includes global expansion, continued extension of HOKA particularly in China, which we're really just getting started still. Apparel opportunities and then also the necessary infrastructure to support the kind of growth both for our DTC channels globally and logistics to wholesale. So as we continue to look at where to invest our money, we feel like the first place is organic growth opportunities, and talent and resources, and our digital transformation. M&A is something we're certainly always keeping an eye on, but honestly I think smaller with high growth potential is more in our warehouse than a big transformative acquisition.\nTom Nikic: Understood. Well, congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. And talk to you soon.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon everyone and congratulations on the quarter and the success. As you think about the marketing spend which is increasing where's the marketing spend going, what have you seen in terms of marketing expense in particular through any channels where you may see higher returns? And then on average costs, any change in average cost in terms of what you're seeing on product? And then lastly, on the shipments and shipping surcharges, how much is that impacting next quarter as compared to this quarter in terms of what you're seeing? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Thanks Dana. On the marketing side, I believe this is a real strength of Deckers and the way we set up our marketing spend is a centralized team that manages all of our spent for our brands globally, by region, by channel and consumer type. And we manage that very closely as a leadership team. We review that those numbers on an ongoing basis and are continually fine tuning the dials to optimize spend. Digital spend is obviously what's driving a great deal of our business. But I also have to give credit to the PR teams across our brands that are just doing an amazing job of creating brand heat at the top of the funnel. And then we're driving that down to our DTC channels through effective marketing tactics. Obviously we have all the traditional marketing channels that we've been using over the years, everything from Facebook, and email, and Instagram, but we did some great tests over the last six months with Snapchat and Pinterest and using influencers, then consumer generated content. And those are all paying off extremely well also. So just getting more targeted, more specific with our trend \u2013 sorry, our spend by channel and consumer type and then as I said putting more into the regions with more localized content leveraging local user-generated content in those regions and then amplifying the strength of our reach through localized channels, particularly in China, where they have different channels than we do in the U.S. But the philosophy, the approach, the financial guardrails around our marketing spent and expected return on investment is managed essentially across the globe. And then we have fantastic teams on ground in regions who are localizing it for the best return.  So we're going to continue to invest in marketing, if you think about it, even at the rates we're spending now, we still haven't really invested to the extent we should, in men's particularly outside of the U.S. or apparel and particularly in China, there's still a lot of opportunity for us to invest in UGG, but certainly in HOKA to drive awareness of that brand. So it's working, it's very productive and there's a lot more opportunity for us to drive growth through increased marketing spent. \nDave Powers: And then Dana, just to answer, I think the other two questions were on average selling price. So average selling price for the company is actually going up and that's being driven by HOKA and the higher proportion of DTC business. So as that proportion has increased and a higher proportion of HOKA it is driving our ASP. Now within UGG, where you have kind of in corresponding channels, you will have a slight decrease as diversity has increased and we're selling more product and lower price product. So interesting dynamics overall, again driving higher ASPs but some dynamics within the brand in a healthy way, driving kind of diversity of product. And then your question on shipping costs. And this relates a little bit to a previous question about gross margin for quarter four. On a proportional basis we're seeing higher expedited shipping costs as we're trying to bring in inventory due to the depleted inventory that we currently have. So that's going to be a headwind on the gross margin as you look at Q4, because again on a proportional basis we'll be looking to increase that.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Dana.\nOperator: And the last question for today will be Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thank you guys and great execution through it all. \nDave Powers: Thanks Jim.\nJim Duffy: Actually I wanted to talk about international markets, Dave really encouraging to hear you're expecting growth for EMEA in fiscal 2022. I know a big part of the success in North America has been through diversifying the consumer base. Are you seeing similar success with the customer base in EMEA and Asia? Are you seeing the same kind of uptake with men in same side of \u2013 same kind of age group diversification?\nDave Powers: Yes, it's a good question, Jim. And we are starting to see signs of that. We've traditionally in Europe, particularly and really driven by the UK have had just kind of a core consumer, a little bit older consumer and that's why you saw the business stagnate over the last few years. But with the focus on a more diverse consumer and speaking to them in a really authentic way, making sure that we are showing up in the right points of distributions, such as JD Sports and Foot Locker, and ASOS in the UK, and also Zalando across Europe and then just showing more exciting, fresh, relevant product on influencers, it's having a positive impact. And what's encouraging to me is we're starting to see younger consumers come in to the brand for the first time through fashion product. It's not the traditional classic that they're buying for the first time they're buying Fluff, they're buying Classic Clear, they're buying Ultra Mini. So it's a new way to enter the brand, it's a much more fun and fashionable consumer that's coming into the brand and they're seeing more wearing opportunities versus just when the cold weather hits and putting on their classic boot. So we're starting to see early days of that, the slipper and the fluff phenomenon was slower to take hold in Europe and Asia, but we did start to see that over the last three to six months in those markets. And it certainly increased opportunity as we go into FY 2022 in those international markets. The other areas, as I said the Ultra Mini and the Classic Clear, but also rain is a great category for us and we're starting to see a lot of traction there, we've had some production issues with our rain boots in the past, but now that we're bringing those to market, we're seeing great success there as well. So we do believe that the playbook so to speak that has enabled the growth in North America, 20% growth in North America for the quarter is a playbook that will serve us well in international. We're starting to see early signs of success. \nJim Duffy: Great. And then that I was pleased and frankly surprised to hear the Neumel was the number one style globally. Are you seeing a balanced penetration of that across region the through, is that more of a North American phenomenon with some catch up to be done in other international markets?\nDave Powers: Yes, it's similar to what we're seeing with a lot of our new revenue drivers as it takes hold in the U.S. first and then we see a trickling into the European and international \u2013 Asia-Pacific market. So we've been driving the Neumel business pretty hard in North America. It hadn't really taken hold in the international markets until the last three to six months. So it's an emerging opportunity for us in those markets, which is great. And again the strength of the men's Neumel and also we have a women's Neumel, so the combination of those two styles gives us great opportunity going forward. And it's also a style that is a really exciting when you start thinking about iterations on that and creating seasonal styles with materials and collabs and things of that sort \u2013 I think it's going to be a stylist got a tremendous runway for us going forward.\nJim Duffy: Thank you. Then, Steve. I know there's been a lot of questions around the inventory but I'm just curious on the mechanics, specific to the December quarter were you able to pull forward receipts to deliver some of that upside in the third quarter? Or was that not how we should think about it, it was really just consuming inventory that was already on the books. And I'm curious in that December quarter did you indeed consume any of the air freight expense? And then is there a way that you can put some shape around the airfreight impact to the margins in the fourth quarter?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Good question, I think you had multiple so I try to unpack some of that. In terms of what happened in Q3. I would say we consumed mostly inventory that we had or inbound inventory that came in and went out in the quarter. And that's why you're seeing inventory down kind of nearly 17%. So it was more about selling out the inventory that we had. We also, as I mentioned kind of shifted some of the orders to in-stock inventory, so that helped lower inventory too. So where we didn't have inventory and an inability to bring it in or have it coming in Q3, shift some of that into product that we did have, that was a successful move. And then in talking about kind of Q4, we're still working through components of that, as I said as a proportion again, the expedited amount that will be coming in Q4 will be higher, remember but Q3 is a much bigger quarter. So not necessarily giving direction on a specific gross margin, but I think where your question was in relationship to one of the previous questions was can we proportionately flow the same level of lift in Q3 or similar into Q4? And I'm saying, no, don't do that, because of our depleted inventory, as we're shifting to more spring and summer, trying to get that inventory in we are having to expedite it. We're still working through some disruptions in the supply chain. So we haven't necessarily quantified, but I would say as you're thinking to build out Q4, I would not extrapolate Q3.\nDave Powers: Those headwinds exist.\nJim Duffy: No doubt, I was hoping you could quantify the airfreight impact in Q4. And then maybe related to that, are you expecting the airfreight to continue to have consequences you didn't for the first half of fiscal 2022 into?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think potentially I think there is a disruption. I can tell you in Q3, the headwind of FX on the gross margin was probably 20 basis points to 50 basis points. And so on a gross margin basis, I would think that will be bigger in kind of Q4, again on a comparable basis. I don't see things getting better in the next six months.  So I think for the foreseeable future, we're going to continue to have kind of disruptions in the supply chain. I think there's pressure on factories to get product out, there's pressure on shipping companies to get ships across the ocean.\nDave Powers: Cost of containers are going up. \nSteve Fasching: There's issues within logistics, within the ports of moving containers and then just getting it to your warehouse and then trying to turn it around. So at multiple steps, we're still seeing headwinds now, I think did a very good job in Q3, but it took a lot. If things aren't getting better, like we have not seen things get better at this point.\nDave Powers: The silver lining is that brands are strong, so the customers, although they are disappointed, they're willing to wait to get the product because the demand for it is so strong, but the costs are still there. \nSteve Fasching: And sorry Jim, just to clarify, I misspoke. I think I said FX it's freight, freight was at 20 basis points to 50 basis points, sorry. \nJim Duffy: Yes. So that makes more sense. Oh, well, great guys. Thank you so much and congratulations on the great quarter.\nDave Powers: Thanks Jim. Take care. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And the Deckers Brands third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to dive into the details of an extraordinary quarter for the company and the exceptional results that our teams have delivered. But first, I would again like to stress the paramount importance of the health and safety of our employees, customers, communities and stakeholders, as they remain top of mind with everyone continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of Deckers, I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Our third quarter results include record setting revenue of $1.078 billion and record earnings per share of $8.99. Revenue grew by 15% over last year's third quarter to deliver Deckers' first ever quarter to exceed $1 billion. Performance in the quarter was driven by delivering relevant and compelling product that consumers are demanding, focusing execution to maximize demand captured through direct-to-consumer channels, engaging consumers with authentic in a modern of product storytelling, executing marketplace management that set the table for high product sell-through and our dedicated employees working tirelessly to deliver strong results, despite the challenging environment. To achieve these results, we overcame both significant operational hurdles as well as macro pressures related to the ongoing pandemic. Steve will be providing more contexts on these unique dynamics later in today's call. We believe much of the strength we have seen in our business fiscal year to date is a result of our continued execution and dedication to our long-term strategies, including driving year-round demand for us through a diverse product assortment, accelerating consumer acquisition online, which increased 87% year-to-date across our portfolio of brands, prioritizing 18- to 34-year-old consumers, which have accounted for the largest percentage increase in our U.S. customer database this year, managing the wholesale marketplace strategically, which has continued to benefit UGG men's in the U.S. and it's progressing in EMEA, globalizing the HOKA ecosystem evidenced by the acceleration of international markets and spending responsibly to maintain high levels of profitability while deploying investments in these key strategic areas. While this last year has led to unique circumstances, allowing our brands to capitalize on positive momentum, our underlying strategies remain central to Deckers' long-term growth and profitability profile. As we adapt our operating model to these accelerated trends, we continue to recognize the need for additional infrastructure investments, allowing us to sustain strengthen our business. More to share on that front during our year-end earnings call in May. I'll now walk you through the brand highlights from the quarter, starting with UGG. The double-digit global UGG growth rate in the third quarter was driven by the strength of the brands diversified and compelling product offering, which has been embraced by a broader range of consumers, momentum with younger and fashion-forward consumers, targeted digital marketing and PR activations, increased purchase frequency from consumers shopping across multiple product categories, significant brand heat in the U.S. with strong selling and sell-through across multiple wholesale accounts paired with exceptional DTC engagement, and traction with localized strategies for international markets beginning to rebuild brand heat within Europe and Asia. The UGG brand success, particularly in the U.S. is the result of the brand's long-term evolution as a leading global lifestyle brand through infusing brand DNA into new and expanding categories. More specifically, over the past four years, UGG has established an impressive resume of collaborations that have helped rebuild the brand fashion credibility. This includes recently announced collaborations with British designer, Molly Goddard, and New York based designer, Telfar Clemens. Combining buzzworthy collaborations, design innovation, and strategically managed distribution through product allocations, segmentation and differentiation, UGG has significantly reduced its reliance on core products while significantly expanding other categories. Evidencing the success of this strategy during the third quarter, women's Classic product volume remained flat year-over-year, while the brand experienced growth across every other major category, including women's non-Classic footwear highlighted by slippers and the Fluff franchise, men's footwear, particularly in the Neumel franchise inherited slippers, kids' footwear through fund variations of popular men's and women's product, and the new ready-to-wear collection, which was a resounding success this season and will be expanded upon next fall with additional products and partnerships. With this transformation beyond core products, the UGG consumer is becoming younger and more diverse. During the third quarter, UGG experienced a 44% increase in customers aged 18- to 34-year-old in the U.S., which was the largest increase of any group and represented the largest percentage of total customers. As UGG continues to expand its audience with younger consumers, it's been critical to enhance the brand's e-commerce engine and digital marketing expertise. The UGG e-commerce platform has continued to evolve as part of Deckers' overall digital transformation, but it has also become a strategic driver of the product development process through exclusive products. By creating products exclusive to DTC, the UGG team is able to both develop special events that drive traffic as well as create a faster feedback loop to enhance future product success with targeted consumers. Momentum with younger consumers has been amplified by UGG earning year-round attention from the emergence of the Fluff franchise. Historically many consumers search for UGG products as weather turned colder. However, with the evolution of Fluff, which features year-round product, UGG is remaining top of mind with consumers. In fact, UGG brand search interest increased 18% for the entire calendar year 2020. We have also observed Fluff as a compelling acquisition vehicle for driving repurchase decisions in other categories. Specifically, our data highlighted many consumers who purchased Fluff earlier this year, returning to purchase the Classic Clear Mini this fall. With more frequent attention from consumers and effective utilization of consumer insights and data analysis, over the last nine months, we've witnessed an 89% increase in repeat purchasers as compared to the same period last year. With more consumers making multiple purchases, the value of the more than 2 million new customers acquired so far this year, it becomes even more impactful for the future growth trajectory of the UGG brand. As the UGG customer database grows, so does the strength of its insights provided by our centralized marketing teams. For example, consumer insights revealed that 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. were the driving factor behind the Neumel becoming a top global style for UGG in the third quarter. While volume growth of the style was impressive, even more exciting was the increase in 18- to 34-year-old purchasers of the Neumel, more than doubled over last year in our domestic DDC channel. With the insights developed around the Neumel consumer, we believe that the recently introduced men's Fluff product will also resonate well with this consumer. First launch in November, the men's Fluff It and Fluff You styles were modeled by NBA legend, Dennis Rodman, in the UGG brand's Chaotic Fun campaign. The UGG team is excited by the positive PR impressions gained from men's Fluff, which sold out in its initial allocation online and it's selling well with key wholesale partners. From a regional standpoint as expected, growth in the third quarter was driven by the U.S. Where according to YouGov, UGG agreed new all time highs in brand consideration, purchase intent, brand impression, and brand buzz among women aged 18 to 34. Over the past three years, the UGG brand's domestic business has added nearly $200 million to the third quarter alone, which we feel is a result of our successful strategy to build brand heat and tightly manage our segmentation and diversification efforts. While a great deal of the domestic strength this year has been driven by owned e-commerce performance, and this continued in the third quarter, pairs sold to UGG domestic wholesale partners during the fall season increased 42% versus last year. Because of the UGG marketplace strategy, wholesale success was broad-based. Given the strength of our sell-through at our wholesale partners this fall, UGG experienced very little promotional activity and season ending inventories in the market are at a historically low level. Internationally, UGG continues to see progress in the multi-year reset in EMEA. Over the last year, UGG has exited approximately 20% of wholesale accounts in Europe and significantly reduced the core Classic product in the marketplace. While revenue in Europe remained a strategic headwind in Q3 due to our ongoing marketplace reset and COVID-related challenges, margins improved as UGG drove a healthier product mix and reduced the need for promotional activity. Overall, we feel the UGG brand is headed in a positive direction in Europe, evidenced by fiscal year-to-date, online consumer acquisition increasing 97% over last year. With favorable consumer acquisition and strengthened strategic youth accounts in the region, we believe UGG could return to growth in EMEA next fiscal year. With the holiday season behind us, we are now shifting our focus towards growing brand heat and consumer attention for the spring and summer seasons. Clearly the strategy we have implemented over the past few years in the U.S. continues to pay dividends, and we are excited by this year's progress with international markets. We still have investments to make in order to rebuild brand heat in these international regions, but feel increasingly positive that our strategy to build diversified product acceptance through fashion credibility is working. Congratulations to the UGG team on executing a fantastic quarter. Shifting to HOKA, global performance was driven by strength in momentum across the brand's entire ecosystem. Among all access points, building the brand's online consumer acquisition and retention has been a primary focus for HOKA. Through optimized digital marketing and geo-targeting, HOKA has managed to increase consumer acquisition online by 117% fiscal year-to-date, while also doubling consumer retention year-over-year. With a growing audience online and dedicated consumer replenishment trends, HOKA has been able to cross the $100 million DDC revenue mark in just the first nine months of fiscal year 2021. With this acceleration online, DDC revenue now represents nearly 30% of HOKA revenue fiscal year-to-date, up from 21% last year. Importantly, HOKA is also firing on all cylinders with wholesale partners as the brand has doubled both awareness and consideration among consumers outside of core runners. According to the NPD Group's retail tracking service, HOKA dollar sales in the U.S. run specialty channel increased 19% for the three months ending December 2020 compared to the same months over the prior year. This growth is despite overall dollar sales of adult running shoes sold through this channel decreasing 4% for the three months ending December 2020. For calendar year 2020, the brand's top three strategic wholesale accounts sold more than $100 million of HOKA product at retail value, highlighting both the strength of these relationships and the relative size of the HOKA brand's direct-to-consumer business. As we have discussed in the past, we are constantly evaluating HOKA distribution to ensure optimized consumer access points. Earlier this year, we began testing DICK'S Sporting Goods with the limited number of doors and product. And so far, the partnership has been mutually beneficial. This spring HOKA will be slowly increasing its door count with DICK'S, and we'll continue to evaluate as appropriate. Ideally, testing these additional access points for HOKA will expose the brand to a larger audience as we work to build further awareness and consideration. During the quarter, HOKA growth was powerful across the globe in every region. And we have been encouraged to see the brand's international growth rate continued to outpace domestic. While revenue dynamics remain in favor of domestic due to the differences in distribution models, 54% of units in Q3 were sold internationally. This speaks to the HOKA brand's global appeal and opportunity overseas as the brand expands. From a product standpoint, HOKA continues to be recognized with awards for its innovative technology and designs. Some of the awards received during the third quarter include the Clifton Edge being named Best Running Shoes in The Rolling Stone Essentials 2020. The BONDI 7 being named Best for Long Runs in Outside magazine's Best Running Shoes of 2021 Winter Guide. And the HOKA, GORE-TEX Shakedry Run Jacket being named Best Running Jacket in the 2021 Women's Health Fitness awards. We are proud to see not only core heritage HOKA products like the BONDI receiving recognition, but also new product innovations like the Clifton Edge and Shakedry Run Jacket, obtaining a claim. We are still in the very infancy of HOKA apparel, but it's promising to see such a positive response so early in the development process. On the innovation front, HOKA has been working to bolster its fly collection, which represents the brand's roster of speed shoes. We believe these lead with speed shoes are an important acquisition vehicle for younger consumers. And I'm excited to share some of the HOKA brands' recent and upcoming launches in the category, including the Rocket X which launched in Q3, the Carbon X2 which launched in January, and the Mach 4 which launches in March. Similar to the original Carbon X that was worn by Jim Walmsley while setting a new world record 50 mile time in 2019, the X2 was launched with a world record breaking 100,000 attempt. While Jim was a few seconds shy of the world record this time, he shattered the American record and it was an incredible event to showcase the brand.  We know Jim will be back for more record-breaking attempts and believe this event further demonstrates the global opportunity that lies ahead for HOKA and our supporting athletes. Congratulations to Jim with this incredible achievement and thank you for showing us what is possible with HOKA performance. We believe that with continued innovation in the speed space, we'll continue to build awareness with consumers aged 18 to 34 and main consumer acquisition momentum, which fiscal year to-date has increased 167% versus last year in the 18 to 34 year old demographic in the U.S. With just under $400 million in revenue fiscal year-to-date, we're confident HOKA will cross the $500 million revenue milestone for fiscal year 2021. We look forward to sharing more around the HOKA growth path on our year-end earnings call in May. With respect to channel performance. In the third quarter, e-commerce growth was exceptional, helping to drive our mix of DTC revenue to 48% up from 44% last year. This is despite declines in retail and growth in the wholesale channel. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 34% versus last year, approximately 75% of our own retail stores were open for the entire third quarter, although in most cases with limited capacity due to enhanced health and safety protocols. In total global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 26% versus last year's third quarter.  Performance was driven by consumer acquisition online, partially offset by a deceleration of retail resulting from macro-pandemic pressures on store traffic. Global wholesale revenue in the third quarter increased 6% as compared to last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by global HOKA and domestic UGG. With offsets from international UGG related to marketplace reset initiatives underway. In summary global demand for HOKA, domestic strengthened UGG, omni-channel execution and disciplined approach to strategic investment and an incredible display of resiliency by our employees operationally led Deckers to double-digit quarterly revenue and earnings growth in the midst of a pandemic.  On behalf of the entire leadership team. thank you to all of our employees across the globe. Your relentless result in getting the job done delivered these record results. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details in our third quarter financial performance, as well as some additional thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Steve? Thanks Steve. To close today's call. I wanted to once again recognize our employees for staying committed to each other and to the success of our company throughout a year filled with uncertainty. I am so appreciative of how our teams rose to the occasion and enabled our brand to deliver exceptional results. Because of this hard work Deckers boast two of the strongest brands in the footwear industry that are both leaders in their respective spaces of fashion and athletic performance. While this year presented challenges and our strategies allowed us to capitalize on certain extraordinary circumstances there is no doubt our brands benefited from a unique consumer environment, where spending patterns shifted away from experiences and into products. As consumers look to brands and products that fit their needs for the current environment, we saw an acceleration of engagement with our brands. And as Steve noted in his comments, we believe the results just delivered will not be sustained at these levels in the longer run. As we return to a more normal environment and invest in our brand to continue to deliver growth globally. We will provide more insights regarding these investments on our fourth quarter call, but I think it's important to note in a year when we saw our accelerated growth, little to no promotion and constrained corporate spending while navigating a global pandemic, these results are exceptional.  At Deckers, we like to say, as our organization performs well, it enables us to do good. With that in mind, we've continued to enhance our ESG programs and increased both our charitable contributions and our employee hours donated well above last year. Doing good and doing great is that the core of Deckers values and is the primary reason behind our leadership in the ESG arena. Moving forward, I have the utmost confidence in our strategies, our portfolio of brands and exemplary operating model that now more than ever give credence to the long-term trajectory of Deckers brands. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes, thanks, Camilo. Those are great questions. And the strength, first of all, the strength of the quarter in UGG with double-digit growth, which I think we all are excited to see, we haven't seen that in some time, is really driven by a diversified product offering. So it's \u2013 in past years we were talking about how much the Classics drove the business and how important weather was. And as you can tell, we didn't mention either of those specifically in the call and that's because we're seeing broad based success across all the categories in women's, but also in men's and kids and including apparel. Slippers is certainly a driver of the success of the Fluff franchise that continues to grow and provide upside for us, but core heritage slippers as well, such as Tasman and Ansley and Ascot. But Classics, as a core Classics business, whereas it's relatively flat and the growth came from non-Classic boots, such as the Classic Clear, the Ultra Mini and the Neumel. In fact, the Neumel this quarter globally was the number one style across all genders. And in the U.S., the men's Neumel was the number one style for the quarter in U.S. wholesale. So, it's great to see that our diversification efforts are paying off. Certainly there is a level of tailwind from COVID and the work-from-home environment, but what's exciting to see is we are bringing in, as we mentioned, a younger consumer. They're shopping more frequently. We saw consumers come into the franchise in Q2 that purchased on our websites, the Fluff product, but they came back in Q3 and they purchased the Classic Clear. And one of the things that I've learned in my tenure at the company here is that once a consumer is in UGG, they're always in UGG, and we're bringing in younger, more diverse consumers than we ever had before. And I think the long-term value of those consumers gives us real competence that if the slipper trend does continue \u2013 start to wane or the tailwind from COVID and work-from-home slows down a little bit, we have new consumers that have now fallen in love with brand in a different way than our prior consumers that were just for the Classic and went on occasion. It's much more fashionable now. Obviously, the collabs and the brand heat and the press that we're getting globally is putting us in a new light. We're now seen as a global fashion lifestyle brand, not just a boot brand. And I think with the innovation that the teams have and how we're evolving the slipper category to not just work-from-home, but from a fashion statement gives me real optimism in that as well. So the brand has never been stronger. I truly believe that. We're seeing demand outpaced supply in Q3. It's broad based across all categories and genders, head to toe, and that momentum we're starting to see in Europe in Asia as well just gives us real confidence that this isn't just a one-time COVID situation. It's a real strength of the brand across broad base. On the HOKA margin question, I'll let Steve answer that. But certainly, the HOKA margin is healthy for us. And as we drive more business online into our e-commerce and DDC channels, both for UGG and HOKA that benefits us. You saw the margin in the quarter, 57%. I believe that's probably an all time high for us in a quarter like this. And that's driven by a combination of full price sell-through at wholesale, and then obviously DDC mix and the strength of HOKA that's laying into that as well. So again, just broad base success gives us real confidence so we can continue down this path going forward. But Steve, do you want to add a little more color? Yes. So we're going to do everything we can to maintain these levels of channel mix and continue to drive upside in DTC. But longer term, it's hard to say at this point what the supply chain environment will look like overseas with tariffs and demand and logistics and other things that we'll have to consider. So there will be some headwinds in the future, but trust, we're doing everything we can to maintain healthy levels of margin. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's nothing to share on that front yet, but trust, it's something we're taking a good look at longer term. We do believe that when we control markets that serves us better obviously from a margin and also consumer data perspective to have their DTC channel. So we're keeping close eye on that. There's a lot of heavy lifting that's involved in that and we'll share a little more color on investments going forward and to be able to maintain this level of growth. But it's certainly something that we're keeping a close eye on. In longer term, it's a great opportunity. All right. Thanks, Camilo. Yes, I think certainly the inventory levels, if you see how we've ended this quarter and how clean the channel is, that's going to serve us well going into next year and beyond. Like I said, the demand broad base globally is very, very strong. And the strength of what we're seeing now with \u2013 returned to growth in FY 2022 for Europe and then some opportunities that we're seeing in China, we're very optimistic about it. I think one of the things that we're learning and we learned over the last six months is the power of localized marketing efforts. And that's what you're seeing in both Europe and China to be driving adoption of new categories, such as Fluff, resetting the brand from a consumer perspective, and we're going to continue to invest to drive that growth. So we still think there's definitely growth in the UGG brand globally. And when you start looking at these new categories and the strength of men's, which was a driver this past quarter as well as kids and apparel, it's a very exciting proposition going forward. Yes. Yes. We're obviously not going to share any details of that on this call. We'll have a little more color in the next call. But just as you said, there is great demand out there. And what's impressive about it is it's diversified across consumer and category by our account segmentation. And the teams have done an amazing job of segmenting our distribution and then supplying them with relevant products. So in the past where everybody was clamoring to get their hands on the Classic, each account now has a different assortment that works for them and we're servicing them more specifically than we ever had before. So that bodes well for the order book. They're seeing new opportunities with younger consumers. And as I said, men's, when you start looking at folks like Genesco and Foot Locker group, there's great opportunity to expand into new consumers and styles. So at this point that's the best way to look at it, but the demand is certainly very, very strong. Yes. Thank you. Yes, you bet, Paul. So on the inventory side, the intentional side of this was on the international regions. We talked about with the transformation of the European market cleaning up their inventory, creating more of a pull model, particularly in Classics. So our inventory levels were expected to come down and there that the strength of the brand and the demand helped us get there faster than we anticipated, but that was by design. And then also in Asia, specifically, China cleaning up the channel there as well. So those were work of the teams in those regions. We're focused on anticipating, but the demand helped us accelerate that even further. Steve, I'll let you comment on the total company. Yes. And I think it gives us a great opportunity to kind of reset in the channel. And I know the teams are working on that. It also allows us to get orders in earlier which will help with our supply chain in our production going into this year, which we know will be challenging, but we're getting ahead of that because of the current situation. But it allows us to really set the channel the way we want it to be and to maintain the strengths and then the positioning of the brand and control it better by distribution type, whether it's DTC or wholesale or depending on the account in wholesale. So it's an enviable position for us to be in and we're going to take advantage of it as best we can. On the HOKA side, what we said before still holds true. We see this as a $1 billion brand with footwear doing the majority of that business and we're still focused on that. Wendy, the President of the HOKA brand, myself and the rest of the LT are evaluating the apparel opportunity. We do believe longer term that this is a significant opportunity for us, but you're looking two to three years out before it has a real meaningful impact. But we want to do it right. We want to make sure that we do hire the right design talent to your point, and that we have the operational and distribution tactics in place to be able to do it in a quality way. We're known for the innovation and the bold approach to footwear. And we need to have the right design talent and supply chain to be able to do that also in apparel and it's something that we're very excited about. And as we talk about investments going forward, apparel, not just in HOKA, but also in UGG is going to be a key area of investment for us over the next couple of years. Yes, that's a great question. A year ago \u2013 two years ago now actually, a year has gone by so fast, Stefano, our Leader of Omnichannel, Andrea, the President of the UGG brand, and the leadership team involved with China and then the brand here, put a plan in place to transform that business. It was traditionally a Classics driven approach or business there. It still is for an enlarged part, but with the focus on localized marketing, on utilizing local influencers, creating excitement around the Fluff franchise and other fashionable styles, such as the UGG Classic Clear, which blew out in no time in China, we're starting to see a turnaround in that business. And again, it's beyond the Classic, it's new, fresh exciting styles from a fashion perspective. The impression of the brand is improving based on the localized marketing efforts and the influencers that we're using there. And this quarter was successful from an inventory cleanup, both for ourselves and our partners over there, which again allows us to set the channel going into FY 2022 the way we want to see it and make sure that we're still driving healthy full price sales at a diversified offering. And we're confident that we continue on that path, but it is going to take investment. And as Steve mentioned in the script, we're starting to reinvest in this quarter, Q4. We were a shy in investment last year for obvious reasons. But now in Q4 and going in FY 2022, China is going to be a pretty significant focus for us in investments, not just in UGG, in marketing, but also to get HOKA off the ground in a real meaningful way. Thank you. I like that. And to drive spring business as well. And I would say from an investment standpoint in SG&A, we do have \u2013 we believe we have a significant opportunity in spring and summer business, particularly for the UGG brand that's obvious than HOKA, but we want to take advantage of this time right now with the momentum in that brand to really drive success in spring and summer this quarter. Obviously we're looking at the full-year results, which will be exceptional based on Q3. But we want to make sure that we're continuing to invest to drive opportunities for the long-term. And then you can back into DTC. Okay. Sure. Thanks Sam. And still a very uncertain environment, we still have store closes in the UK and sporadically across the world. And we're going to be coming into Q1 up against last year's pandemic and that's mixed results based off category and region, and channels. So there's a lot to navigate still, but you can't deny the demand and the strength of the brand at the current time, but we just have to balance that out, the fact that we're still in an uncertain environment. Yes. Tom, I think it's a good question. And clearly it's we're having a lot of conversation around capital allocation with the cash that we have on hand. Now having our strongest quarter of the year behind us and having an exceptional result for the quarter gives us opportunity to look at a number of things and so that is what we're doing right now. More conversations with management and board in terms of capital allocation, I would say just more to come, but recommencing our share repurchase is a good start to that. Thanks, Tom. And then Dana, just to answer, I think the other two questions were on average selling price. So average selling price for the company is actually going up and that's being driven by HOKA and the higher proportion of DTC business. So as that proportion has increased and a higher proportion of HOKA it is driving our ASP. Now within UGG, where you have kind of in corresponding channels, you will have a slight decrease as diversity has increased and we're selling more product and lower price product. So interesting dynamics overall, again driving higher ASPs but some dynamics within the brand in a healthy way, driving kind of diversity of product. And then your question on shipping costs. And this relates a little bit to a previous question about gross margin for quarter four. On a proportional basis we're seeing higher expedited shipping costs as we're trying to bring in inventory due to the depleted inventory that we currently have. So that's going to be a headwind on the gross margin as you look at Q4, because again on a proportional basis we'll be looking to increase that. Thanks, Dana. Thanks Jim. Yes, it's a good question, Jim. And we are starting to see signs of that. We've traditionally in Europe, particularly and really driven by the UK have had just kind of a core consumer, a little bit older consumer and that's why you saw the business stagnate over the last few years. But with the focus on a more diverse consumer and speaking to them in a really authentic way, making sure that we are showing up in the right points of distributions, such as JD Sports and Foot Locker, and ASOS in the UK, and also Zalando across Europe and then just showing more exciting, fresh, relevant product on influencers, it's having a positive impact. And what's encouraging to me is we're starting to see younger consumers come in to the brand for the first time through fashion product. It's not the traditional classic that they're buying for the first time they're buying Fluff, they're buying Classic Clear, they're buying Ultra Mini. So it's a new way to enter the brand, it's a much more fun and fashionable consumer that's coming into the brand and they're seeing more wearing opportunities versus just when the cold weather hits and putting on their classic boot. So we're starting to see early days of that, the slipper and the fluff phenomenon was slower to take hold in Europe and Asia, but we did start to see that over the last three to six months in those markets. And it certainly increased opportunity as we go into FY 2022 in those international markets. The other areas, as I said the Ultra Mini and the Classic Clear, but also rain is a great category for us and we're starting to see a lot of traction there, we've had some production issues with our rain boots in the past, but now that we're bringing those to market, we're seeing great success there as well. So we do believe that the playbook so to speak that has enabled the growth in North America, 20% growth in North America for the quarter is a playbook that will serve us well in international. We're starting to see early signs of success. Yes, it's similar to what we're seeing with a lot of our new revenue drivers as it takes hold in the U.S. first and then we see a trickling into the European and international \u2013 Asia-Pacific market. So we've been driving the Neumel business pretty hard in North America. It hadn't really taken hold in the international markets until the last three to six months. So it's an emerging opportunity for us in those markets, which is great. And again the strength of the men's Neumel and also we have a women's Neumel, so the combination of those two styles gives us great opportunity going forward. And it's also a style that is a really exciting when you start thinking about iterations on that and creating seasonal styles with materials and collabs and things of that sort \u2013 I think it's going to be a stylist got a tremendous runway for us going forward. Those headwinds exist. Cost of containers are going up. The silver lining is that brands are strong, so the customers, although they are disappointed, they're willing to wait to get the product because the demand for it is so strong, but the costs are still there. Thanks Jim. Take care."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard Decker's third quarter performance was incredibly strong and speaks well to the success of our strategies driving demand for our brands. While this year has been full of unique circumstances, our performance has been enabled by the work we have undertaken to transform Deckers to a digitally-led organization with strategically managed distribution channels and innovative product creation that consumers demand. I am proud of our organization's ability to effectively manage our resources, overcome operational obstacles, manage with financial discipline and achieve exceptional results in the face of adversity. I am confident that as we move forward and beyond the pandemic, our brands and organization are positioned to emerge with continued growth opportunities, strength and discipline. Before moving into our results for the quarter, I would like to start with a little context. Back on our second quarter earnings call, we laid out a number of tailwinds experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. These tailwinds included compelling products that are resonating with consumers in the current environment, accelerated adoption of e-commerce, our brands benefiting from consumer trends shifting toward casualization as people continue to work from home and heightened awareness of HOKA. With the results we just delivered, we were able to capitalize on these variables in the third quarter as well. We also discussed some potential headwinds that we anticipated could impact the third quarter as we stepped into our peak season. To quickly summarize, the assumed challenges were the potential for both owned and third-party shipping constraints. A second wave pandemic impact on operations. Limitations resulting from inventory purchase reductions at the onset of the pandemic. And finally higher shipping and warehouse costs related to increased safety and hazard pay as well as increased marketing costs to capitalize on brand momentum. And I am pleased to say that through some advanced planning early in the quarter, hard work on the part of our employees, close partnership with many of our accounts and a dedicated consumer base, we were able to mitigate much of the anticipated impact. More specifically, actions taken to address these headwinds were to bring on incremental shipping capacity with additional partners. Create greater utilization of DC by-passed shipments to wholesale customers, implement effective safety measures that helped limit our own retail store closures and allowed shipping to remain operational at our California distribution center for the duration of the quarter. In some cases shift consumer demand for out of stock items to other available products and a measured approach to managing spent during the quarter. Overall, the net impact of these factors helped to drive our exceptional results for the quarter. And our business was aided by demand that drove much stronger revenue than anticipated. Now for financial specifics, revenue in the third quarter was $1.078 billion up 15% versus the prior year. Performance as compared to last year was primarily driven by global UGG growth of 12% to $877 million, which was fueled by a domestic increase of 20%, partially offset by the continued international reset, but worth noting that we saw improving signs throughout the quarter. And global HOKA growth of 52% to $142 million, which experienced an 92% increase in DTC and a 40% increase with wholesale.  Gross margins in the third quarter were up 290 basis points over last year to 57%. The increase in gross margin was related to the strong full-price selling environment of UGG as demand far outweighed supply, helping significantly limit any promotional activity. Favorable channel mix as DTC increased as a proportion of the total business. Very limited wholesale close outs as demand outpaced supply for many styles and benefits from favorable exchange rates during the quarter. SG&A dollar spend was $285.2 million, up 13% from last year's $251.9 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by variable marketing, warehouse and logistic costs, and performance-based compensation partially offset by savings from lower travel and retail expenses. This all resulted in record earnings per share of $8.99 which compares to $7.14 in last year's third quarter. The $1.85 improvement versus last year, again was driven by increased revenue volume seen from the growth in UGG and HOKA brands, a higher proportion of full-priced UGG revenue and a higher mix of DTC revenue, favorable currency rates and SG&A leverage in the quarter as revenue accelerated much faster than expenses, with some offsets from greater spend on marketing, warehouse, and performance-based compensation, as well as the combined impacts of a higher tax rate and higher share count. Our year-to-date performance has delivered significant operating margin expansion in comparison to the same period last year. This has been driven by factors including, DTC mix increasing significantly, with the acceleration of our e-commerce business and while we still anticipate growth going forward, the magnitude of the shift is not anticipated to continue. A historically low promotional environment, resulting from very high demand, significantly minimizing, both discounting and close outs. And temporary operating expense savings with discretionary constraints employed early in the year at the onset of the pandemic. With these benefits partially offset by rising freight expense, that could go higher in the future and our strategic investment in marketing that we intend to continue fueling going forward. For the quarter our tax rate was 22.2% driven by higher mix of domestic and DTC business. Our balance sheet remains strong and as of December 31, cash and equivalents were $1.157 billion. Inventory was $305 million down 17% from $366 million at the same time last year. And we had no short-term borrowings under our existing credit line as compared to $6 million last year. Our existing credit lines have an available balance of $474 million. During the quarter we did not repurchase any shares. Earlier this year at the onset of the pandemic we paused our share repurchase activity, but now intend to recommence share repurchase under the existing $160 million outstanding authorization in future periods. As we continue to navigate the global pandemic, we will not be providing specific guidance on the fourth quarter, but we do want to highlight a few considerations as we look to finish out the fiscal year.  We expect revenue to grow in comparison to last year's fourth quarter, more specifically on UGG. We see growth with our domestic business, as we lapped last year's impact of delayed and canceled wholesale orders and physical retail store disruption at the onset of COVID-19. But we continue to expect pressure on our international wholesale business as we are still in the midst of a marketplace reset. And on HOKA, we expect global growth as the brand continues to drive year-round demand and continue to see expectations of annual revenue exceeding the 500 million milestone. Then on costs, with the success we saw in Q3 and an ability to bring increased awareness to our Spring/Summer offerings, we plan to increase our marketing efforts, this will likely result in a significant increase in our marketing spend for the quarter. And as we continue to navigate the global pandemic, we continue to experience higher costs related to logistics and warehouse fulfillment. These include increased safety measures put in place at our distribution center, expedited freight to replenish inventory of depleted in-demand styles and accelerated spend to increased logistics capacity. In addition, with these strong results, we will see higher performance-based compensation costs related to our higher level of performance for the year. Therefore when factoring these considerations in and recognizing that Q4 represents one of our smaller revenue quarters, the spend increase will be disproportionate to revenue, all potentially resulting in a lower earnings per share for the quarter year-over-year, but still delivering strong results for the full year. Before I hand the call back to Dave, I would like to say how pleased we are with our fiscal year-to-date performance. Our teams have done an enviable job managing through operational and macro challenges while ensuring the long-term vision of the organization remains intact. Our brands are full of momentum. The company remains well positioned and we are prepared for the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks everyone. And I'll now turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes. Camilo, probably just a little bit more color. In terms of, as we think about normalizing on the gross margin, I think in the quarter we saw about a 100 basis points due to promotion. As we think about that going forward, that would normalize. So we wouldn't necessarily see kind of really as much full price selling that we saw in the current quarter. And then we did have a little bit of channel mix and then FX, which is probably about another 100 basis points. And that we would also begin to see normalize as we get into kind of a more normal quarter with more promotion in a normal environment, and then not the FX lift that we saw in the current quarter either. Yes. I would say 200 that would \u2013 due to the exceptional quarter that we would attribute, and then \u2013 and it always changes, right, as you think about promotion and how much. But I think the very clean quarter as we talked about in the prepared remarks, definitely contributed at least a 100 basis points. As I said, FX about 50 and then channel mix with the higher proportion of DTC, we would expect some of that to come back as there was a higher proportion of DTC selling in the current quarter. Yes. I think just to add onto that, Jon. The diversity that we saw on a product in Q3 was really impressive. So UGG had its most diverse selling quarter, probably ever. Yes. So Paul, kind of as we saw total company down, it was really all brands except for HOKA. HOKA's inventory was up. But as you would expect with the brand growing kind of over 50%, trying to just keep pace with that growth is a challenge. I think from an inventory perspective, as Dave said, lower than what we thought, but helped us kind of chase incremental sales. Going forward, there are still disruptions in the supply chain. So we'll be working to bring inventory kind of as quickly as we can as we continue to see demand. So that'll be an area that we're working very closely with our suppliers, really to make sure that we're getting inventory in. So as we've depleted it, as we've seen inventory levels in the channel significantly lower, it's a big focus of our supply chain to manage that inventory and manage that incoming inventory. So pleased with the position, but also know it's lower than what we expected and so how do we replenish it really going forward. Yes, I'll take that, Sam, first. So on the SG&A, it's going to be more, right. Because we've been holding back really kind of through the pandemic as Dave just said. And even as we've looked at marketing, now I think with the success that we're seeing with the brands, the need to invest more. Yes. So we're looking at how you can drive an increased kind of spring-summer business year-over-year. And that is contributing to a disproportionate increase in the SG&A spend in Q4. So again, haven't given full guidance, but expect that to be seen in Q4. Then on the gross margins, I would not extrapolate what we saw in Q3 from a gross margin perspective year-over-year into Q4. I think some of the tailwinds that we saw in Q3 were much bigger than what we would anticipate in Q4. So I wouldn't necessarily increase Q4 gross margins like you saw in Q3. We won't be getting \u2013 we'll get some, but not the extent that you saw in Q3. Yes. Okay. So wholesale sales in Q3 for UGG call it $408.9 million, HOKA was call it $101 million, wholesale Teva was $12.1 million, Sanuk was $3.8 million and this is in millions and then other brands was $32.2 million. Yes, I think Tom it's a little bit hard. It's again, why we're not giving guidance. We see opportunity, we're also dealing as I kind of mentioned on the previous question, some supply constraints with bringing inventory in and so forth, so that's affecting Q4. So we're really not in a position to give a lot. We see, clearly it's something like we've said when we were approaching the fall-winter season, the demand is there. The opportunity is there. We still have to manage through kind of inventory, bringing inventory in, expediting inventory. And that's really why we're not giving kind of more specifics. The opportunity is there for UGG, but there are some constraints in the system as we continue to kind of navigate the current environment. So I would just say, the opportunity to do more is there, but there are other constraints that will provide headwinds against the ability to meet the demand that's out there right now. Yes. And I think, listen we have incredible opportunities with organic growth with our brands. And we need to make sure that first and foremost we're executing on that opportunity. And that includes global expansion, continued extension of HOKA particularly in China, which we're really just getting started still. Apparel opportunities and then also the necessary infrastructure to support the kind of growth both for our DTC channels globally and logistics to wholesale. So as we continue to look at where to invest our money, we feel like the first place is organic growth opportunities, and talent and resources, and our digital transformation. M&A is something we're certainly always keeping an eye on, but honestly I think smaller with high growth potential is more in our warehouse than a big transformative acquisition. Yes. Thanks Dana. On the marketing side, I believe this is a real strength of Deckers and the way we set up our marketing spend is a centralized team that manages all of our spent for our brands globally, by region, by channel and consumer type. And we manage that very closely as a leadership team. We review that those numbers on an ongoing basis and are continually fine tuning the dials to optimize spend. Digital spend is obviously what's driving a great deal of our business. But I also have to give credit to the PR teams across our brands that are just doing an amazing job of creating brand heat at the top of the funnel. And then we're driving that down to our DTC channels through effective marketing tactics. Obviously we have all the traditional marketing channels that we've been using over the years, everything from Facebook, and email, and Instagram, but we did some great tests over the last six months with Snapchat and Pinterest and using influencers, then consumer generated content. And those are all paying off extremely well also. So just getting more targeted, more specific with our trend \u2013 sorry, our spend by channel and consumer type and then as I said putting more into the regions with more localized content leveraging local user-generated content in those regions and then amplifying the strength of our reach through localized channels, particularly in China, where they have different channels than we do in the U.S. But the philosophy, the approach, the financial guardrails around our marketing spent and expected return on investment is managed essentially across the globe. And then we have fantastic teams on ground in regions who are localizing it for the best return.  So we're going to continue to invest in marketing, if you think about it, even at the rates we're spending now, we still haven't really invested to the extent we should, in men's particularly outside of the U.S. or apparel and particularly in China, there's still a lot of opportunity for us to invest in UGG, but certainly in HOKA to drive awareness of that brand. So it's working, it's very productive and there's a lot more opportunity for us to drive growth through increased marketing spent. Yes. Good question, I think you had multiple so I try to unpack some of that. In terms of what happened in Q3. I would say we consumed mostly inventory that we had or inbound inventory that came in and went out in the quarter. And that's why you're seeing inventory down kind of nearly 17%. So it was more about selling out the inventory that we had. We also, as I mentioned kind of shifted some of the orders to in-stock inventory, so that helped lower inventory too. So where we didn't have inventory and an inability to bring it in or have it coming in Q3, shift some of that into product that we did have, that was a successful move. And then in talking about kind of Q4, we're still working through components of that, as I said as a proportion again, the expedited amount that will be coming in Q4 will be higher, remember but Q3 is a much bigger quarter. So not necessarily giving direction on a specific gross margin, but I think where your question was in relationship to one of the previous questions was can we proportionately flow the same level of lift in Q3 or similar into Q4? And I'm saying, no, don't do that, because of our depleted inventory, as we're shifting to more spring and summer, trying to get that inventory in we are having to expedite it. We're still working through some disruptions in the supply chain. So we haven't necessarily quantified, but I would say as you're thinking to build out Q4, I would not extrapolate Q3. Yes, I think potentially I think there is a disruption. I can tell you in Q3, the headwind of FX on the gross margin was probably 20 basis points to 50 basis points. And so on a gross margin basis, I would think that will be bigger in kind of Q4, again on a comparable basis. I don't see things getting better in the next six months.  So I think for the foreseeable future, we're going to continue to have kind of disruptions in the supply chain. I think there's pressure on factories to get product out, there's pressure on shipping companies to get ships across the ocean. There's issues within logistics, within the ports of moving containers and then just getting it to your warehouse and then trying to turn it around. So at multiple steps, we're still seeing headwinds now, I think did a very good job in Q3, but it took a lot. If things aren't getting better, like we have not seen things get better at this point. And sorry Jim, just to clarify, I misspoke. I think I said FX it's freight, freight was at 20 basis points to 50 basis points, sorry."

Amidst rapidly evolving marketplace conditions, Deckers delivered a record second quarter as revenue increased by 15% versus last year to $624 million. Gross margin increased by 80 basis points to 51.2% and we delivered earnings per share of $3.58. Success in the quarter was driven by compelling and innovative product launches, our powerful e-commerce and digital marketing engines that drove higher awareness and customer acquisition, optimization and redeployment of marketing spend that featured in our authentic approach to storytelling, a clean and well managed marketplace that allowed for strategic account partnerships to amplify special product releases, and the ability of our supply chain to pivot resources and navigate challenges. While the COVID-19 outbreak put a spotlight on our brands due to their lifestyle resonance, these results more importantly highlight the strength of our brands and the positive impacts we have experienced from the successful execution of our strategy over the past few years. As a reminder, the key elements for our strategy include generating greater awareness in HOKA ONE ONE to accelerate customer adoption globally, which was demonstrated by a 60% increase in brand revenue during the first half, driving DTC customer acquisition across all five of our brands with product and marketing tailored to the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, highlighted by 182% increase in these customers year-to-date in the U.S., continuing to build UGG brand heat [ph] through diversification of product that resonates with target consumers leading to low-levels of promotional activity, while selling a more balanced product assortment, and maintaining a disciplined approach to financial management even as we continue to invest in this strategy. The successful implementation of this strategy has led to the strong operating model and powerful brand portfolio we have today. With brands and products are resonating with a larger and more diverse audience, we're experiencing high conversion rates and strong selling at full retail price, which will set the stage for future growth. Our in-demand brands omnichannel capabilities and strategic expense management, combined with exceptional organizational execution drove another successful quarter for Deckers. I'd like to share my appreciation to our employees for their dedication and consistency in delivering results in these challenging times. I'll now walk through the brand highlights from the quarter starting with the Fashion Lifestyle Group. The Fashion Lifestyle Group consists of the UGG and KOOLABURRA brands. Global outperformance was driven by momentum behind a healthier and more balanced product assortment. Historically the second quarter had been driven by filling in classic UGG product to wholesale accounts. With the excitement the brand has built around Fluff, Men's and Kids product, UGG is succeeding beyond core product with both selling and high full price sell-through at wholesale and DTC. Fluff is the paramount example of the progress UGG is making to attract a diverse set of consumers with a broad array of product options. The Fluff Yeah remained the brand's top-selling style from both the total peers' perspective, as well in terms of wholesale sell-through. But the UGG team has also done a fantastic job building around the Fluff Yeah with complementary product that is providing incremental growth. New introductions during the quarter included the Disco Slide and Fluffita, which were both among the top-10 styles purchased by customers aged 18 to 34 years old. UGG is having tremendous success attracting new younger consumers. While Fluff product may have been the primary attraction to the brand for 18 to 34-year-olds, we're excited by how many of these customers who bought Fluff also purchased the recently launched Classic Clear Mini. Since its release over 60% of the Classic Clear Mini purchases online have been made by 18 to 34-year-olds. This multi category produced activity from younger consumers speaks well to the brand's ability to capture share of closet with fashion minded consumers. Helping to amplify these new product introductions with their intended audience, the UGG DTC team has collaborated with key wholesale partners to develop strategic launch plans for special products. During the quarter, these included teaming up exclusively with the Victoria's Secret Pink Ambassador program to release the Fluffita and launching the UGG brand's first ever ready-to-wear apparel collection in partnership with Nordstrom. Ready-to-wear, which we sometimes refer to as RTW, is the UGG brand's first apparel expansion beyond loungewear an into street wear fashion. The RTW collection features cozy fleece, Sherpa [ph], full fur and Sherling wardrobe items. Highlighting the strength of our brand, demand for our products, and quality of our partnerships, Nordstrom featured the RTW collection on their website landing page, which was the first time UGG earned that designation outside of the forward category. In addition, our ready-to-wear and retail teams have worked closely with Nordstrom to create a specialized shop-in-shop concept to feature the collection of both Nordstrom New York City flagship in December as well our own New York City flagship which opens on November 19. While ready-to-wear is not expected to drive significant revenue volume this year, sell-through has been impressive and we're encouraged to see cross category purchasing of ready-to-wear and footwear products. Given the positive response from primarily younger consumers, we feel this speaks well to the long-term lifestyle opportunity for UGG and our teams are already working to expand ready-to-wear with additional products and partners. Continuing the theme of UGG diversification and cross category purchasing, I'd highlight that men's and kids product contributed to the majority of the brand's incremental dollar growth in the quarter. Men's has had a strong start to the fall season. Neumel sell-through is up over 150% versus last year and heritage slipper styles such as the Ascot, Tasman and Scuff remained top sellers. With the success of the fluff and the increased fashion ability of the slipper category, UGG is releasing a men's specific version of Fluff very soon, so be on the lookout for that. As mentioned on our first quarter call, the UGG kids business is benefiting from the successful takedown product in both women's and men's. The Neumel Fluff Yeah Slide and the Classic Clear Mini were all part of the top-5 kids style in the quarter and we will look to further capitalize on this trend during holiday. From a regional standpoint, we continue to see bifurcation between the U.S. and international regions. Within the U.S. UGG brand heat is reaching new highs as the brand has increased customer acquisition by 187% and customer retention by 155% versus last year, with majority of the growth coming from younger customers. In fact, 18 to 34-year-olds represented 40% of online purchasers in the U.S. during the quarter as compared to under 30% last year. Complementing the UGG brand's direct to consumer success, our wholesale partners are also experiencing record levels of demand and product sell-through rates, which may lead to some scarcity in the third quarter as reduced inventory levels are consumed. Internationally, as we have mentioned in previous calls, UGG remained in the midst of a multiyear reset in EMEA and the brand is also in the early stages of localizing marketing content for the Asia-Pacific region. In Europe we're seeing positive signs where the brand is beginning to experience adoption of Fluff product in addition to some small growth within men's and kids footwear. We are also intentionally reducing the amount of core classic product in the region, which remains a strategic headwind. These are important shifts as we work to rebuild brand heat and diversify the European region away from core product and build a healthier product mix, akin to the successful transition we have made in the U.S. Beyond building a more balanced assortment, UGG is working to amplify the EMEA region's business online. To help drive digital conversion in EMEA, we recently implemented our global E project, which improves customer access and ease of use by offering additional languages, currency, and local payment types. The launch of global E [ph] combined with the introduction of UGG rewards in Europe is already helping attract new customers as UGG experienced a 135% increase in customer acquisition during the second quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, we've made strides by partnering with top tier local celebrity, Xiao-Dong Yu, who carries fashion credibility with a fan base primarily aged 20 to 30 years old. We've also developed a market relevant product collaboration with designer Feng Chen Wang, famous for her deconstructive approach as featured in Vogue and GQ. These initiatives are aimed at improving brand perception with Chinese consumers and bringing attention to new products. We're encouraged by the region's positive reception to new products like the Classic Clear, Fluffita and Disco Slide, but there is still plenty of work to be done to build brand E. We are optimistic about some early indicators in the UGG brands international business, revenue declined as expected for the first half of fiscal 2021, primarily due to efforts to reduce core product in the marketplace. While we don't anticipate meaningful improvement during this year of transition, UGG is making important progress and building a new foundation of diversified product acceptance, localized market relevance, and strategic partnerships, all designed to build a healthier brand with the ability to deliver growth over the long term.  The UGG brand's domestic success is built on this model of fashion credibility through authentic collaborations, social influencers and PR seeding, and we believe this approach will translate well to our international markets. First half performance gives us the confidence that we're on the right path of exploiting the strategy, building towards next year and beyond. Moving to Koolaburra, performance in the first quarter resulted from increased market share with top wholesale partners as well as improved category diversification through the expansion of men's and kids product. Last year Koolaburra established itself as the top brand in the sub $100 category which competes within the family value channel, and will look to maintain that position by building incremental market share this holiday season. While footwear remains the primary focus, Koolaburra continues to expand its lifestyle appeal. This fall the brand has partnered with Kohl's and QVC to develop a licensed loungewear collection, which comes on the heels of last year's successful collection of home licensed product. Both UGG and Koolaburra are well positioned to drive demand with their respective customer bases during this holiday season. However, I would like to remind everyone that we adjusted certain inventory buys at the outset of this year to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 in our business and this will limit the upside for both UGG and Koolaburra this holiday. However, if either brand fails to capture incremental upside due to these inventory constraints, we expect this will provide a clean marketplace for fiscal 2022 Shifting to the Performance Lifestyle Group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sunak. Starting with HOKA, performance was driven by increased adoption of our products through greater brand and product awareness, combined with compelling product refreshes, and a fast replenishment cycle. Among Deckers investments over the past few years, broadening the HOKA brands appeal beyond core runners has been a primary focus. Through market leading innovation, the HOKA team has refined products and expanded categories to attract a larger audience, while also maintaining the brand's authentic performance DNA. During the Quarter HOKA launched updates to several key franchises, each infused with both innovation and design upgrades, including the Clifton 7, Clifton Edge, Rincon 2, and the BONDI 7. Regarding the Clifton franchise, these styles have received considerable positive PR, which included features in Vogue, Gear Patrol and GQ, and SELF's 2020 Certified Sneakers Award. For the Rincon, originally introduced in July of 2019, the style has quickly become a top five seller for HOKA. The second edition of the Rincon has been so well received that it recently won Runner's World, Best Value Award, in their autumn, winter 2020 shoe guide. And lastly, in terms of notable product refreshes, the BONDI 7 hit shelves in September and features the brand's most inclusive size range, helping to expand the addressable consumer base for HOKA. Since its release online, the BONDI 7 has been the HOKA brand's top selling style. Propelled by these product updates and innovations HOKA domestic wholesale returned to deliver meaningful second quarter growth after the first quarter was disrupted by pandemic induced store closures. As mentioned in our first quarter called, HOKA delayed certain product launches to allow wholesalers to move to existing product, which provided an extra benefit to the brand's second quarter wholesale revenue growth. According to the NPD Group's retail tracking service, HOKA was able to both grow dollar volume and increase market share from 16.8% in August to 20.5% in August 2020, even though overall dollar sales of adult running shoes in the U.S. run specialty channel declined in August 2020, as compared to last year. The premium service atmosphere of Run Specialty stores remains an important acquisition vehicle for the HOKA brand, especially when considering the higher conversion rates experienced when customers try on our products. Globally, HOKA customer acquisition and retention online increased 81% and 92% respectively, as compared to last year, even though most of the brand's wholesale doors were open during the quarter. Part of these increases were due to the whole marketing team's efforts to optimize digital media targeting to acquire 18 to 34-year-old consumers. By strategically prioritizing this audience, HOKA experienced a 124% increase of consumers aged 18 to 34, led by recently released styles such as the Clifton 7, Clifton Edge and Rincon 2. Importantly, HOKA is driving direct-to-consumer growth across the globe. While still very small as compared to the U.S., international HOKA DTC has increased more than 150% in the first half of this year. Growing the brand's global online business is especially important as the inability to hold in-person events persist. We're dedicating marketing spend to build a HOKA audience online and stay relevant with existing consumers, through compelling product innovation. As we said in our first quarter earnings call, the $500 million milestone for HOKA is much closer than we previously anticipated. And with the brand heat in demand we're experiencing right now, HOKA has potential to reach $500 million by fiscal year end. The rapid acceleration of HOKA reaffirms our confidence in the brand's aspirations to eclipse the $1 billion mark over the longer term. Turning to Teva, growth in the brand was fueled by a 78% increase in acquired customers online. Teva is turning out to be the go to brand for the modern outdoor consumer, highlighted by the brand's founding roots in the Grand Canyon. Year-to-date through September, Teva maintained its position as the top outdoor water sandal brand in the U.S. in terms of market share, increasing market share over the last year in each of the past nine months according to the NPD Group's retail tracking service. Younger consumers have been the driving force behind this growth in Teva and the brand has experienced a 76% year-over-year increase in purchasers aged 18 to 34 years old, which was already the brand's highest indexing age bracket. Looking to fall, Teva is focused on capturing continued wallet share from this demographic to the brand's expanded hike and camping collections. Teva is already experiencing a surge in demand for the brand's Ember [ph] franchise, both online and with key wholesale partners such as REI, where product will be featured across all doors in their fleet. For Sanuk, brand performance was hurt by a soft department store channel. However, we were encouraged by the recovery within surf specialty as coastal towns saw an increased outdoor participation. Importantly, Sanuk posted a second consecutive quarter of robust direct to consumer growth, which was helped by a 40% increase in customer acquisition online. We are excited to receive feedback from the brand's online audience as Sanuk will be introducing new product innovations in the coming months. With respect to channel performance in the second quarter, all five of our brands experienced exceptional growth online driving our mix of DTC revenue to increase from 18% last year to 28% this year. This is despite the significant improvements in our wholesale business and inclusive of the recovery efforts within our own retail stores, as compared to the disruption experienced in the first quarter. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 86% versus last year. Approximately 95% of our own retail stores were open for the entire second quarter and as of this week all stores are open. In total, global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 74% versus last year's second quarter. Performance was driven by continued customer acquisition online, and a sequential improvement in retail performance as compared to the first quarter. Global wholesale revenue in the second quarter increased 2%, as compared to last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by HOKA, but mostly offset by a decline in UGG. The decline in UGG wholesale revenue differs from a regional standpoint, international UGG wholesale revenue declined due to the ongoing marketplace initiatives previously mentioned, while domestic UGG wholesale revenue decreased, as both pre recorders were conservatively adjusted at the height of the pandemic, and UGG has successfully shifted open a buy with retailers toward lower priced products such as slippers, Fluffs and kids footwear. The UGG wholesale revenue decline in the second quarter was somewhat tempered by our global effort to shift Q3 shipments forward, allowing our distribution center teams to focus on DTC fulfillment. To summarize, we are extremely pleased with our brands performance and operational execution in the second quarter. With the demand we're experiencing in our brands, we're anticipating operational challenges related to DC capacity, inventory, timing and availability, as well as third party shipping logistics that will limit the upside of our brands in the third quarter. Though less than ideal circumstances, I'm confident in our team's resilience and ability to manage the effects in our business, while protecting the sanctity of our strong brands. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance, as well as some additional thoughts on managing the balance of fiscal 2021. Steve?\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back at the past six months, we are proud of how our business has performed over the opening half of our fiscal year. In the midst of a global pandemic, while consumer behaviors are rapidly shifting with changing lifestyles, our brands and product offering have been placed in a unique position. And as demonstrated by our results, our product proposition is resonating with consumers, helping to drive an exceptional quarter. In particular, UGG has benefited from consumers working and learning from home, as the brand has been known to provide consumers with a feeling of comfort and security, and at the same time, HOKA benefited from its increasing awareness and positioning within the expanding active category. These trends helped drive attention to the work our brands are doing, and created awareness of our innovative line of products. While much of the current environment remains uncertain, we continue to focus on delivering great products that amplify our brands and meet consumer demands. Now for more detail on our second quarter results, revenue in the second quarter was $623.5 million, up 15% versus the prior year. Performances compared to last year was primarily driven by global HOKA growth of 83%, which experienced balanced gains across all regions and channels, but also benefited from first quarter product launches that were delayed to the second quarter and global UGG growth, which was up 3% versus the prior year to $415 million. This increase for the quarter was driven by robust global direct-to-consumer growth of 69% as well as approximately 25 to 30 million of earlier global shipment of product to wholesale and distributor accounts as we worked to decrease some of the logistical load on Q3. Although as expected, the overall wholesale UGG business experienced lower revenue for the quarter versus last year, as many wholesale partners planned more cautiously this year due to uncertainty at the onset of the pandemic, as well as the impact of our international reset. Gross margins in the second quarter were up 80 basis points over last year to 51.2%. Gross margins increased due to favorable channel mixes, DTC increased as a proportion to the total business, favorable brand mix with the sizeable increase in HOKA volume and benefits from favorable exchange rates. SG&A dollar spend was $190.4 million, up 8% from last year's $175.9 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and warehouse costs that were partially offset by savings from travel and retail expenses. This all resulted in an earnings per share of $3.58, which compares to $2.71 in last year's second quarter. The $0.87 improvement versus last year was primarily driven by a higher proportion of DTC and HOKA business with offsets from lower UGG wholesale revenue in greater marketing spend and warehouse costs. Our balance sheet remained strong and as of September 30, cash and equivalents were $626 million, up from $178 million at September 30 of last year. Inventory was down 13% to $484 million from $559 million at the same time last year. And we had $9 million in short term borrowing under our existing credit line as compared to $13 million last year. Our existing credit lines have an available balance of $463 million and during the quarter we did not repurchase any shares. During this period, we historically provide an update on our sheepskin pricing. We continue to see stable prices in the sheepskin market, and we expect no change in our sheepskin costs for fiscal 2022. Please note, this does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year, as our sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margins. As we've now completed the first half of fiscal 2021, we remain disciplined in our approach to planning the second half of the year as we are aware of the unique circumstances surrounding the upcoming holiday season. We are mindful of shipping constraints during the upcoming peak, including not only our own operations, but also the operations of third party shipping and logistics services that we utilize. The logistics infrastructure, both internal and external, will continue to be tested by current challenges paired with unknown pandemic developments, which could be significantly impacted by a second wave of the disease, or any impacts from government orders or restrictions. While remaining vigilant, we will tightly manage the business and drive opportunities where we see potential for success, all with our primary focus on the long-term health of our business, and a continuation of driving success through our strong brands and innovative product offering. Looking to the back half of fiscal 2021, we're conscious of the historical size and relevance that our third quarter represents to full year revenue and earnings. In a typical year, the three months representing our third quarter equates to more revenue than we've recognized over the first six months. This dynamic combined with the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic place additional pressure on our third quarter this year, and may lead to reaching capacity thresholds that have yet to be experienced year-to-date. These capacity thresholds will be tested at our retail stores. Given that the October through December in store purchase volume typically represents two to three times the volume of any other three-month period. Additionally, while we are comfortable with current inventory levels in a year where we tempered inventory buys at the outset to reduce risk, we may see demand outpace supply with certain product. In these cases, we will be challenged with meeting the in-season demand, but at the same time, it will continue to drive brand heat, encourage full price selling and result in a clean marketplace for the fourth quarter and beyond. With all that, said and given the continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we will once again not be providing specific guidance for fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will update some of the major themes of our business. For context, we observed complex pandemic impacts in the first half of the year, including some tailwinds from the acceleration of e-commerce, brand heat and attention resulting from changing consumer trends, extended consumer adoption of categories providing the unique comfort of UGG and heightened consumer awareness of HOKA. While we anticipate that some of these trends may continue to provide opportunities, they may be dampened by the headwinds yet to be experienced, that are particularly relevant during our peak season in the back half of the year. Specifically, pressure from shipping constraints with third party providers, higher costs associated with our own warehouse operations in the current environment, product scarcity on key styles that are selling faster than anticipated, and increased marketing cost to capitalize on the momentum of our brands and stay top of mind with consumers. With these considerations in mind, we are approaching the back half of fiscal 2021, with the possibility that UGG revenue may fall below last year levels if the brand is up against potential capacity constraints, some earlier shipments into Q2, retail traffic pressure and continued work with our international business reset. And as Dave mentioned, we continue to see growth with HOKA, but at a lower rate than experienced in the first half, yet on the path to $500 million. And we anticipate higher expenses resulting from marketing spend to keep our brands top of mind, warehouse costs for safety measures and higher wages and increased IT expenses as we build out appropriate support systems for our accelerating e-commerce platform. Before I hand the call back to Dave, I would like to say how pleased we are with the results of our first half. As it gives us confidence that the organization can manage through the current near term challenges, while remaining committed to our long-term vision. Our brands are in a great place. The company is well positioned, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. As I reflect on the unique first half, I'm proud of our organization's collaborative efforts to prioritize the consumer and deliver results. Our brand teams have done an excellent job delivering compelling and innovative products. Our omnichannel organization has been the engine driving product messaging, executing sales and providing analytics to inform future brand success, but paramount to the first task success this year has been our operations teams with heavy lifting being done by our product development teams, distribution center employees, customer service specialists, and all other individuals working throughout our supply chain. A huge thank you to every one of our employees for their continued execution of our strategies during these very challenging times. And along with performance, it is our organization's belief that we have a responsibility to continue to do business in the right way and Deckers continues to drive forward on ESG initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we've recently been recognized by Investor's Business Daily as the 15th ranked company in their top 50 best ESG companies list for 2020. This is an improvement from our number 20 ranking last year, and I note that we are the sole footwear or apparel company included in the top 50. To that end, I'm excited to share that our creating change FY '20 annual corporate responsibility report will be released tomorrow, highlighting the tremendous progress made by our global organization in FY '20. The report will be posted on our website and I encourage you to check it out. On that note, and in the spirit of making a positive impact, earlier this month Deckers held its first ever Art Of Kindness Week, which was an organized effort to encourage employees across the globe to give back through volunteerism. Collectively, I'm proud to report that our team's contributed more than 2000 hours to assist over 200 organizations, ultimately reaching many individuals who need help in these trying times. To remain focused on these types of efforts in the midst of a pandemic, while driving business growth is a testament to Deckers values and approach. It is these values exemplified by our dedicated employees and top performing brands that just yesterday earned Deckers the honor of being named Footwear News Company of the Year for 2020. I'd like to thank and congratulate our employees on this well deserved achievement. In closing, I have a high degree of confidence in our strategy, portfolio of brands and top tier operating model to navigate through these short-term challenges while also investing in our digital transformation to support growth over the long-term. Thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Camilo Lyon with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys and great job on the execution.\nDave Powers: Thank you, Camilo.\nCamilo Lyon: I wanted to first ask about your relative inventory position. I think Steve, you said you feel comfortable with your inventory but demand trends could exceed supply. And you're noting that as a cautionary point to watch out for. I\u2019m wondering what category specifically you\u2019re anticipating being under inventory then? And do you have the ability or have you tried shifting purchasing behavior or intent to comparable categories or skews that are in better stock, in a better stock position?\nSteven Fasching: Sure, Camilo. I'll go first and then maybe Dave can jump in. Absolutely kind of what you said we are taking a look at. So with inventory down 13% we are comfortable with where we have inventory. As I said, at the onset of the pandemic, we did make some strategic reductions in styles. What we've seen really over the course of the last six months is an acceleration on certain styles, specifically, kind of slipper/sandal categories, we've done very well. And as a result of that we have run short. Now, in the time since then, we have looked to bring more inventory in and we're in the process of doing that. So, we intend to bring more inventory in this quarter, as well as Q4 that will help kind of fill out some of those shortages on styles, colors, sizes. But if there's disruption that will create some challenges logistically, so we're doing a lot to overcome that. We're bringing things in kind of as quickly as we can with those identified styles and where we may be short, we are steering customers to styles that we have more in stock on. So all of the above, right? We want to take advantage of the brand heat that we have going, the consumer demand that's out there for these styles. We want to use that then as an opportunity where we have scarcity to push him into other products that we do have in style.\nDave Powers: Yes, that's exactly right and we're seeing the consumer shift to other products and other categories. But generally speaking, whether it's slippers, classics, fashion boots, winter boots, we're seeing strong sell-through particularly in DTC but also at wholesale of all the categories, including ready to wear. So the demand for the brand, at a high level remains very strong, as you see in the accelerated interest over the quarter. Younger consumers are adopting the brand at new levels. We've increased our rate of 18 to 34-year-olds by over 180% for the quarter. And we're chasing the inventory where we can. So we feel confident that if there's no logistics disruptions, we'll be in good place. I think it's a healthy place for our brand to be in this chase mode. And, while we're focused on delivering Q3, we're really focused on the long term health of the brand, and the setup that this demand and healthy marketplace means for us over the long-term. We're just seeing a lot of potential right now.\nCamilo Lyon: That's great. Just two follow [indiscernible]. Steve, you mentioned last quarter that you were anticipating cancellations to outpace pre orders, is that still the case? And then on a longer term basis, Dave, maybe we would love your insights into this, you are looking to reach at least mid teens, probably 15, maybe a little bit above 15% EBIT margin this year, very strong operating metrics there. Clearly, you've taken the brand to the next level with new demographic coming in. Where do you see the long-term margin opportunity? Can this be a high teens or low 20s business over time?\nDave Powers: I'll go, so this is Steve, I'll go first. Really kind of as we think about where we're at, on the inventory and cancellations, it's why we're not giving guidance, right? We don't know what's going to happen, what kind of at wholesale. If everything holds up, can you, we won't have the cancellation issue. If things get more challenging from a logistics standpoint, some retail is closed, there may be cancellation. So that's really what we want to see kind of over the course of the next couple of weeks. I think it's too early to tell, and kind of why we're holding off on guidance.\nSteven Fasching: Yes, exactly. To your question on kind of longer term, we're looking at this right now. We just had a conversation with the Board a few weeks ago. I guess the best way to think about it is we're committed and we've proven that over the last three plus years to this mid teens operating margin. But there is going to have to have to be some investment in the next coming, one to two years to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that we're now seeing. Our long-term strategy through COVID has actually probably been accelerated with the shift to e-commerce, younger consumers coming in, the increase marketing spend. But we're going to need to invest in, further capabilities to optimize that e-commerce engine even more than we already have to provide better dead data and analytics, capabilities, systems improvements, and just continue to fuel the growth of these brands through marketing, our marketing is paying off tremendously right now and we increased our marketing spend over the past quarter by 30%. So this is one of those situations where, the engine is firing on all cylinders, but we need to keep it going. So I would say we're, you can count on us to deliver on mid tier operating margins, whether we get up, above 16%, 17%, 18%. The opportunity is there but it all depends on how fast we're going to have to invest in the mid-short to mid-term to be able to keep the top line going at, what we're shooting for is high single digits, double-digit percent growth over the next few years.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it, sounds good. Good luck in the holiday. Take care.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, Camilo.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Camilo.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. I'm curious if you're already seeing some of these constraints happening in your business or have you been able to manage through them this quarter thus far? And then I guess, I'm kind of also curious on the marketing side. Does it make sense to spend as much marketing as you are given you're concerned about potentially not being able to meet demand, the risk perhaps disappointing some customers if you can, in fact, meet that demand? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yes, I would say so far, the teams have done an incredible job which I referenced in the script on managing our distribution and our logistics to date. We've had to put in place social distancing measures. We've had to pay more to employees for hazard pay, et cetera and recruiting has been a challenge. So they've done an incredible job working through this and working with the order book and the sales team to balance deliveries. So far, we haven't seen major disruptions, but the level of put through that we're going through right now is nothing compared to what's coming in the next couple months. And so that's really when the capacity of taking inbound deliveries that are in some cases delayed because of logistics from Asia Pacific, into the DC and at the same time turning around and putting product into the marketplace. That's where the pinch could come in the next couple of months and that's what we're really mindful of and planning for. So haven't seen major disruptions yet, within our control. We have seen them in logistics, but we're feeling confident of our ability to manage through it, but as Steve said, there's still so much uncertainty coming up ahead of us. With regards to kind of marketing, we are very surgical in our marketing, now. We have a center of excellence on digital marketing and spend around the world and we, navigate based off return on spend by brand channel and region. And so, we're cautious of the fact that where there may be constraints on upsides due to marketing, and we're putting our marketing dollars in places where we know we'll get the payoff such as HOKA to continue to grow that brand and you saw the 80% plus percent growth in Q2. In different markets, we're releasing some money to continue to assist international and the transition of the UGG brand and just, we're testing at the same time. So the marketing is paying off. We're adopting a younger consumer. We're getting multiple purchases from a younger consumer within the quarter. Normally, we wouldn't see purchases for UGG products more than once a year, traditionally a classic style. But now we're getting people, many consumers that bought the Fluff earlier in Q2 came back and purchased the UGG Clear. So the marketing is paying off. It's driving overall brand and awareness and buzz about the brand. I don't have a lot of concerns about missing sales and wasting marketing spend. I think we're very efficient on that and very targeted, and so far, it seems to be working really well.\nSteven Fasching: Yes, and I think, Paul, just to add on that, I think the other thing on the constraints is really third party logistics, so we are hearing from third party freight companies logistics constraints. And that's going to be really universal. So that is one thing we're keeping a close eye on. So one is kind of constraints within really what we control, but also what's outside of our control. And we are seeing signals around that. So that's something that we're going to watch carefully, and look to find alternatives to work around some of those situations. Kind of on the marketing, just to add to what Dave said, where we are marketing to certain styles that may be low on inventory, there is an opportunity to shift some of that marketing. So to the first question to Camilo said, we can start to shift some of that marketing to product that we have in stock. So we have an opportunity to kind of move that in stock. And then I think the other important component is really our international reset. We can use money. So this is not just about domestic, it's about how we can accelerate some of our international reset, and deploying some of that marketing money around to kind of repositioning our brands and products and awareness in the international markets.\nDave Powers: Yes, and as we said in Q1 call, and we'll continue to stay focused on, we want to take this opportunity to steal market share wherever we can. So we want to stay aggressive on marketing, continued to drop innovative, exciting products in the marketplace, bringing in younger consumers and we're going to have to continue to spend marketing dollars to do that. But it's really now about scaling the global opportunity based on the success that we're seeing in the domestic market.\nPaul Lejuez: Got you. I'm just like I just got 4% of the ready to, what percent of the UGG business is ready to wear and same question for HOKA, what percent of the power?\nDave Powers: Yes, so ready to wear for UGG is less than 10%. It's mostly high single digits right now. It's a small business right now, but this ready to wear launch for us was really a test, a proof of concept test and the results have been phenomenal. The price points are perfect. The styling and the detailing is resonating with a younger consumer. And we launched it primarily in DTC and with Nordstrom and it was the first time, Nordstrom\u2019s ever put us on their landing page for apparel. They're incredibly pleased with the sell-through. We've had a lot of accounts calling trying to get their hands on the product. So for us what this means is there's just a lot of opportunity on this category in the next three to five years. So now we're just another opportunity for us to invest in design and creative talent and go-to-market talent for that category. So small, but very exciting from a launch perspective. HOKA apparel is even smaller. That's really early stages of development there. We are working with some folks externally to bring in some more talent to ramp that up. But the $500 million, the $1 billion numbers that we've put out there, we don't believe those need an apparel business to hit those targets. So it would be incremental to that. Those kinds of numbers at this point, but early days of HOKA, it's less than probably 3% of total sales.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it, thank you. Good luck guys.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, thank you. Just a follow up on the -- all the commentary you've given on UGG, which is really helpful thinking about, the third quarter and really the second half of the year, are you saying, Steve, when you look at the scenarios and some of the planning, are you saying there's no scenarios where UGG can be flat or up for the period or just trying to gauge the degree of the constraints that are out there relative to potential scenarios? And did you call out any explicit costs that we should be thinking about for some logistic impacts?\nSteven Fasching: Yes, so Jon, again, we're not giving guidance. What I wanted to call really to attention is, we're dealing -- we're kind of in the middle of a pandemic we're dealing with constraints. And so we have seen growth in the first half. As I mentioned, and mentioned on last call, we're looking and did successfully move some product in Q2 that would traditionally go in Q3. And so it really depends. And again, it kind of this is again, why we're not giving guidance is, it depends on what happens. If it's a clean Q3, but given everything we're seeing, it's hard to see no disruption in Q3, that's how we're kind of looking at UGG and planning for it. So, that's -- I just want to provide a little bit of caution as we think about it, there's been some shifting in product. We have, because of the onset conservative cuts that we made in terms of inventory, we're up against some constraints on inventory. So we're going to do the best that we can, but it's going to be work, and we're working against some external factors that we're going to have little control over.\nDave Powers: Yes and then the setup for q4 and spring product looks promising as well. But it all depends on how we're able to get through q3 before we get to that point.\nJonathan Komp: Okay, that's really helpful. And maybe a broader question on HOKA. I know you've talked about this $1 billion plus aspiration for a while. Just thinking about, at least that incremental $500 million compared to this year, nearly a quarter of your total company sales today. Could you just talk through, what are the margin implications of that, given the mix shift that will drive toward HOKA even further over time?\nDave Powers: Yes, I'll go first. What we've said historically, in its channel, compared to UGG, it is a little bit better. And so as the proportion of HOKA the gross margin implications are that, if we don't get into situations where we're having to discount, again we're dealing with a brand that is on fire, growing 80% of course [ph] which is crazy. We can hold full price selling. So as long as we can do that margins are by equivalent channel compared to UGG slightly better, but at the same time, then we're also spending more on marketing. So as a brand that is still being discovered by many, we spend considerably more on developing HOKA and brand awareness and consumer awareness with that brand. So from a gross margin standpoint, as long as the brand is hot and continues to grow like it is, and there's little promotion around that brand, it is incrementally positive. But at the same time, we're also investing considerably more in developing that brand and building that brand.\nJonathan Komp: Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you. Good luck for holiday.\na Dave Powers: All right.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You spoke a lot about, capacity constraints, both internal and external. And it kind of seemed like, for the most part, you were speaking in reference to UGG. Do these same constraints or anything like that apply to HOKA. And, it would seem to, you have to get the $500 million this year, you don't need, the growth in the back half of the year for HOKA would be much slower than it was in the first half. So is there anything preventing you from far exceeding up? I know 500 million is a big number. It's a big gross number. But I mean, it kind of seems like with the momentum and the brand and the growth rates that you've been seeing, even in the midst of the pandemic, that, it could even be better than that.\nDave Powers: Yes, I think I'll jump in on that. So keep in mind that, some of the deliveries and the business that we had intended to do in Q1 for HOKA ended up happening in Q2, because the wholesale being closed for most of the Q1, so hence, the 80 plus percent growth. But from an internal perspective, we don't have a lot of constraints on HOKA, the inventory, we're chasing the inventory as fast as we can, we're in pretty good shape heading into the back half of the year and inventory in HOKA. And the demand is still there, it's really relying more on kind of the macro environment, and an external factors for us.\nTom Nikic: Got it, and\u2026\nDave Powers: Sorry, just the biggest challenge that we're facing is just the, it\u2019s really last seven to eight weeks of the quarter on UGG where DTC ramps up dramatically. And at the same time, we're inbounding product and shipping out to wholesalers. It's that period of time where that's where we're exercising caution here, because there's so many different factors that could implement, get in the way of that being successful. But that's an UGG dynamic, less so on HOKA.\nTom Nikic: Understood, that's helpful. And you know on UGG and I know, maybe this is a tough question to answer at the moment, but obviously, there's been a lot of noise lately, even pre COVID, with the brand reset in Europe and stuff like that, when sort of everything is normal, when we're past COVID, when the international reset is done? Like, what kind of growth should UGG be generating? I mean, is this a mid single digit grower or is it something better than that? Something worse than that? I mean, I'm just kind of wondering, like, in a normal environment, like, how should we think about UGG over the long-term?\nDave Powers: Yes, it's a good question. I would say it's probably low single digits, under 5%, but healthy, sustainable, full price sales growth. And what's encouraging for me right now is to see, again, how many new young consumers have now adopted UGG into their consideration set, and they're choosing to come to our website, they're looking for new product, they're bright, they're buying from our websites more than once in a quarter across categories. We even see a healthy mix of consumers who bought footwear and ready to wear. We haven't seen that before. And so I think, if you look at the success of the Fluff franchise in the slipper or sandal, hybrid phenomenon that we've created, there's still a lot of longevity in that trend. It's less about being inside in slippers, and it's more about fashion. The amount of new consumers we have in our database and our ecosystem that we can now manage for an optimized the lifetime value of those consumers. The excitement that's happening in men's, we're launching Fluff product for men's, in the next couple of weeks with an exciting ambassador that you'll see shortly, the ready to wear opportunity. And if we can get international through their transformation and heading to positive territory again, you could see this as pretty healthy, sustainable, long-term growth. And we're optimistic but where the brand is, it's the healthiest and most exciting I've seen it since I've been here over eight years and so we feel good about the potential going forward.\nTom Nikic: Right, yes. Thanks very much. And best of luck this holiday season.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Yes, excellent. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the momentum.\nDave Powers: Thanks.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, John.\nJohn Kernan: I wanted to ask you on the mix shift to DTC and HOKA obviously drove tremendous gross margin expansion in the first half of the year and also drove a lot of SG&A leverage. The DTC and HOKA shift, seemingly should continue into the back half of the year. How should we think about your margin structure in the back half relative to the performance you had in the first half, both on the gross margin and SG&A line?\nDave Powers: Yes, I'll take that one. Again, we haven't given guidance. But I think the way to think about really kind of the back half is you start getting up against the kind of bigger numbers. So Q1, Q2 are huge on a percentage basis, because those tend to be kind of smaller quarters. And now as you get into really the back half, you're up against kind of bigger numbers. So the expansion that you saw in the first half is not necessarily indicative of what you'll see in the second half. Clearly, we're going to have similar impacts from the changing dynamic. The impact will not be as much as what you saw, really, in the first half.\nSteven Fasching: The strength of DTC, upside from a percent growth perspective is more dramatic in UGG, HOKA is more just kind of holding steady as the trends that they've been on. But the UGG business from a DTC perspective is super strong.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Certainly a lot of momentum, maybe just one more follow-up would be when you think about that $1 billion run rate of sales for HOKA, what are you most excited about, from a category level and geographic level to get you, to give you that confidence and is doubling that business?\nDave Powers: Well, I think, you know, it's obviously still founded in core authentic running and continuing to be a leader in that category. In some cases, we're seeing, we're number two, in some cases, number one market share already, but the difference between us and the number one, market share holder, which tends to be Brooks, generally speaking, we could almost double our market share, and still be neck-and-neck with Brooks. So there's still a lot of opportunity in the core run specialty channel. The two things that get me most excited are just the expansion to a broader set of consumers. So it's, more, consumers that aren't just buying it just for running, it's everyday athletics or lifestyle. And we're starting to see, that broad base of consumers being attracted to the brand, for the performance attributes that it provides. We still want to keep our distribution tight. We're focusing on our tight ecosystem of very selected wholesale partners key accounts, and then driving e-commerce. So we can optimize that business for the long term. But I think the real unlocked to the $1 billion is continued acceleration of our EMEA business, particularly online. We've made quite a few investments over the last year to allow the e-commerce business there to flourish, and we seeing positive results on that, but it's still small compared to the US. And then I think when you think beyond $1 billion, it's really Asia Pacific, and we're just getting started in China. Obviously, that's a massive opportunity for us. But, we think we can get to that $1 billion mark with real strong growth continuing in the U.S. and accelerated growth in EMEA and then beyond that is just, even more upside once we get into those territories in Asia Pacific and newer categories.\nJohn Kernan: That's excellent, congrats on all success.\nDave Powers: All right, thanks, John.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Thank you. I'm honored to be last. Guys, can you adjust some housekeeping and then I have some more detailed questions. Could you give us either the revenue or the revenue growth for wholesale by brand for DTC by brand for each brand, you gave UGG? Whatever it was, and the Can you give the rest of them for modeling purposes, please for the quarter?\nDave Powers: Yep, sure, Sam. So UGG wholesale for the quarter was $292 million, HOKA was $108 million, Teva was $18 million, Sanuk was $6 million all else was call it $28 million and then our DTC was $172 million.\nSam Poser: Okay, great. So I got a couple questions. Other than that, I guess you've talked a lot about the transformation going on in EMEA and APAC. What, I mean, as you see it today, what's the timetable for being, sort of -- for being at a, the, let's say, the beginning stage of how the us, turn when the U.S. turn really kicked in, which would be a few years, a couple years ago.\nDave Powers: Yes, in my sense, it's been obviously challenged because of the COVID situation, both in Europe and Asia Pacific, particularly China. That being said, we have seen some signs of promise with category adoption. So the phenomenon of the Fluff franchise in the U.S. hasn't really hit Europe or China yet. But in the last weeks of the quarter, we're starting to see some excitement around those categories, younger consumers positive strong sell-through of those categories, but also the brand. So, the increased marketing, the focus on PR, and collaborations, the new ambassador that we signed in China, those are all so far showing positive results, not big enough to move the total country needle because we still have some scarcity, work to do as far as resetting the classics business. But people are starting to see these, the UGG brand as a more fashion relevant brand than they have in the past. So I would say you'll start to see return to growth probably next fall in those markets and gives us, an indication of where we can go from there. But I think the work that the teams are doing right now, and the way we're shifting investments in our approach to be tailored to each of those markets, is working well. The teams are doing a great job. And I think you'll start to see, like I said that return to growth probably next fall into the FY '22 and beyond.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then you had talked earlier or on previous calls about the test with HOKA you were doing with Dix, could you give us an update there and how they're managing it and what the plans may be? And then lastly, and I've got others, but lastly, you're talking about the New York flagship I saw 58 Street close. Where is this store going to be?\nSteven Fasching: Yes, I'm trying to remember what your first question was.\nSam Poser: Dix.\nSteven Fasching: Yes, Dix. Yes, so yes, the 11 store test has been going very well. They're very pleased. The sell-through has been strong. We tested with them, it was like three or four years ago, a small test and the results were not good. It's a whole different ballgame now. So again, we're managing that relationship, closely pleased with the results and what they're selling. We're not looking to expand dramatically with those with that account just yet. Again, it's just very strategical and methodical approach as to how and if we go much bigger in Dix, but so far, the results are very promising. In down the road, we're also exploring opportunities with the Footlocker banner as well, early and ongoing conversations there yet, but still, really cautious about the timing of when we go into those new accounts.\nSam Poser: And then the New York store?\nSteven Fasching: Yes. So it's on Fifth Avenue.\nDave Powers: I don't have, yes, we don't have the exact.\nSteven Fasching: It's right across from the NBA store on Fifth Avenue. Tremendous location, highly visible two floors, lots of windows, great foot traffic, both local and tourists going by there. It's our largest store ever. Two floors and it's going to showcase all the ready to wear a new store design be much more fashion, focused than we have been in the past, lots of color and excitement. And then some great storytelling an experience for the brand with an elevated service model for omnichannel capabilities and testing a lot there and then a new mobile POS system to go along with that. So there's a lot to be excited about. Obviously, the timing, we wish was better. But this will be a catalyst for the brand globally. And we'll be looking to roll out the new store concept to key partners and other flagship locations, as time permits over for the time is right over the next coming years. But, there's great storytelling that we're going to be able to do and I'm excited for everybody listening and the consumer to go in and experience the other ready to wear collection and a new look for the face of UGG.\nSam Poser: Thanks, can I have one more?\nDave Powers: Yes, the opening date on that is November 19, Sam.\nSam Poser: Thank you. Just to confirm. So your DTC, UGG DTC business in Q4 is going to be hampered by, is it hampered by store traffic or is it going to be hampered by product availability and the amount you can ship because of will it be capacity constraints in stores that can't be overcome by e-commerce or what's going on in the distribution center or both?\nDave Powers: Yes, just so I'm clear on that, Sam when you said Q4, you mean our Q3.\nSam Poser: I'm sorry. Q3, the December 4.\nDave Powers: Yes, it is. Yes, it is really more just about constraints. So one will be from a, from retail how much traffic is allowed in stores, some of the mall based stores? What do the malls look like? Can people get in? So that's going to be kind of the one constraint. And then I would say, as I mentioned before, just externally, it will be what shipping capacity looks like. So the more we can direct e-commerce, and the more we can capture early is beneficial, right? It helps us navigate, I think some of the what I'll say are macro level constraints that are more out of our control, we're doing the best that we can kind of that's under our control, which is really about inventory management, bringing more product in this year than we did a year ago, and a quarter where we have constraints as we have lower inventory going into Q3. So those are all the things that we're working with, and trying to get to the consumer the demands there. They're showing up online. We are confident in our ability to kind of fulfill that if there are not constraints in place, but we know there's going to be some, so\u2026\nSteven Fasching: Go ahead, Sam.\nSam Poser: Do you think you can be -- I mean, do you, when you set UGG overall, is unlikely to be up in the quarter is that more of a wholesale issue or more of a direct-to-consumer issue or do you expect direct to be up just it can't be up as much as Q2 -- nearly as much as Q2 because of the average numbers.\nDave Powers: Yes, so it's more wholesale focus, just be able to get inventory through the pipeline and chasing inventory. DTC, we still think we'll be able to have -- show some growth there. We're up against big numbers last year. If you remember, last year was a very strong quarter for us, particularly in DTC and stores. So that velocity is going to be hard to comp, but we're confident that DTC continued to be strong. And the last thing I'll say, before we end the call, and all this is 15%. growth in this environment is exceptional, but I can't stress enough how hard it is, and how hard people are working to ship to be able to cover this kind of increased demand and our distribution centers and our online businesses and chase this inventory is really hard to do. And I give our teams a ton of credit to be able to do that. And we're heading into, the biggest, you know, in some ways, the demand for our brands has never been stronger, but we're heading into the most uncertainty we've ever faced. And we have more demand on our website in our straining our systems than we've ever seen before. We're handling it extremely well so far. But like I said, when we get into these last few weeks of November into December, and that pinch point, for getting product to consumers, that's the area that we're really cautious about. Because this is hard work and being able to ship this quickly with those kinds of shifts in consumer demand is a strain and we're handling it well. But that's where we're focusing on providing some caution there.\nSam Poser: Thanks so much and continued success.\nDave Powers: Thank you, Sam.\nSteven Fasching: Thank you, Sam.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and also concludes our conference.

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the call. On behalf of Deckers, I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe in this unprecedented time. Today we will walk through an exceptional second quarter performance for the Deckers organization and highlight continued considerations related to the uncertain environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst rapidly evolving marketplace conditions, Deckers delivered a record second quarter as revenue increased by 15% versus last year to $624 million. Gross margin increased by 80 basis points to 51.2% and we delivered earnings per share of $3.58. Success in the quarter was driven by compelling and innovative product launches, our powerful e-commerce and digital marketing engines that drove higher awareness and customer acquisition, optimization and redeployment of marketing spend that featured in our authentic approach to storytelling, a clean and well managed marketplace that allowed for strategic account partnerships to amplify special product releases, and the ability of our supply chain to pivot resources and navigate challenges. While the COVID-19 outbreak put a spotlight on our brands due to their lifestyle resonance, these results more importantly highlight the strength of our brands and the positive impacts we have experienced from the successful execution of our strategy over the past few years. As a reminder, the key elements for our strategy include generating greater awareness in HOKA ONE ONE to accelerate customer adoption globally, which was demonstrated by a 60% increase in brand revenue during the first half, driving DTC customer acquisition across all five of our brands with product and marketing tailored to the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, highlighted by 182% increase in these customers year-to-date in the U.S., continuing to build UGG brand heat [ph] through diversification of product that resonates with target consumers leading to low-levels of promotional activity, while selling a more balanced product assortment, and maintaining a disciplined approach to financial management even as we continue to invest in this strategy. The successful implementation of this strategy has led to the strong operating model and powerful brand portfolio we have today. With brands and products are resonating with a larger and more diverse audience, we're experiencing high conversion rates and strong selling at full retail price, which will set the stage for future growth. Our in-demand brands omnichannel capabilities and strategic expense management, combined with exceptional organizational execution drove another successful quarter for Deckers. I'd like to share my appreciation to our employees for their dedication and consistency in delivering results in these challenging times. I'll now walk through the brand highlights from the quarter starting with the Fashion Lifestyle Group. The Fashion Lifestyle Group consists of the UGG and KOOLABURRA brands. Global outperformance was driven by momentum behind a healthier and more balanced product assortment. Historically the second quarter had been driven by filling in classic UGG product to wholesale accounts. With the excitement the brand has built around Fluff, Men's and Kids product, UGG is succeeding beyond core product with both selling and high full price sell-through at wholesale and DTC. Fluff is the paramount example of the progress UGG is making to attract a diverse set of consumers with a broad array of product options. The Fluff Yeah remained the brand's top-selling style from both the total peers' perspective, as well in terms of wholesale sell-through. But the UGG team has also done a fantastic job building around the Fluff Yeah with complementary product that is providing incremental growth. New introductions during the quarter included the Disco Slide and Fluffita, which were both among the top-10 styles purchased by customers aged 18 to 34 years old. UGG is having tremendous success attracting new younger consumers. While Fluff product may have been the primary attraction to the brand for 18 to 34-year-olds, we're excited by how many of these customers who bought Fluff also purchased the recently launched Classic Clear Mini. Since its release over 60% of the Classic Clear Mini purchases online have been made by 18 to 34-year-olds. This multi category produced activity from younger consumers speaks well to the brand's ability to capture share of closet with fashion minded consumers. Helping to amplify these new product introductions with their intended audience, the UGG DTC team has collaborated with key wholesale partners to develop strategic launch plans for special products. During the quarter, these included teaming up exclusively with the Victoria's Secret Pink Ambassador program to release the Fluffita and launching the UGG brand's first ever ready-to-wear apparel collection in partnership with Nordstrom. Ready-to-wear, which we sometimes refer to as RTW, is the UGG brand's first apparel expansion beyond loungewear an into street wear fashion. The RTW collection features cozy fleece, Sherpa [ph], full fur and Sherling wardrobe items. Highlighting the strength of our brand, demand for our products, and quality of our partnerships, Nordstrom featured the RTW collection on their website landing page, which was the first time UGG earned that designation outside of the forward category. In addition, our ready-to-wear and retail teams have worked closely with Nordstrom to create a specialized shop-in-shop concept to feature the collection of both Nordstrom New York City flagship in December as well our own New York City flagship which opens on November 19. While ready-to-wear is not expected to drive significant revenue volume this year, sell-through has been impressive and we're encouraged to see cross category purchasing of ready-to-wear and footwear products. Given the positive response from primarily younger consumers, we feel this speaks well to the long-term lifestyle opportunity for UGG and our teams are already working to expand ready-to-wear with additional products and partners. Continuing the theme of UGG diversification and cross category purchasing, I'd highlight that men's and kids product contributed to the majority of the brand's incremental dollar growth in the quarter. Men's has had a strong start to the fall season. Neumel sell-through is up over 150% versus last year and heritage slipper styles such as the Ascot, Tasman and Scuff remained top sellers. With the success of the fluff and the increased fashion ability of the slipper category, UGG is releasing a men's specific version of Fluff very soon, so be on the lookout for that. As mentioned on our first quarter call, the UGG kids business is benefiting from the successful takedown product in both women's and men's. The Neumel Fluff Yeah Slide and the Classic Clear Mini were all part of the top-5 kids style in the quarter and we will look to further capitalize on this trend during holiday. From a regional standpoint, we continue to see bifurcation between the U.S. and international regions. Within the U.S. UGG brand heat is reaching new highs as the brand has increased customer acquisition by 187% and customer retention by 155% versus last year, with majority of the growth coming from younger customers. In fact, 18 to 34-year-olds represented 40% of online purchasers in the U.S. during the quarter as compared to under 30% last year. Complementing the UGG brand's direct to consumer success, our wholesale partners are also experiencing record levels of demand and product sell-through rates, which may lead to some scarcity in the third quarter as reduced inventory levels are consumed. Internationally, as we have mentioned in previous calls, UGG remained in the midst of a multiyear reset in EMEA and the brand is also in the early stages of localizing marketing content for the Asia-Pacific region. In Europe we're seeing positive signs where the brand is beginning to experience adoption of Fluff product in addition to some small growth within men's and kids footwear. We are also intentionally reducing the amount of core classic product in the region, which remains a strategic headwind. These are important shifts as we work to rebuild brand heat and diversify the European region away from core product and build a healthier product mix, akin to the successful transition we have made in the U.S. Beyond building a more balanced assortment, UGG is working to amplify the EMEA region's business online. To help drive digital conversion in EMEA, we recently implemented our global E project, which improves customer access and ease of use by offering additional languages, currency, and local payment types. The launch of global E [ph] combined with the introduction of UGG rewards in Europe is already helping attract new customers as UGG experienced a 135% increase in customer acquisition during the second quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, we've made strides by partnering with top tier local celebrity, Xiao-Dong Yu, who carries fashion credibility with a fan base primarily aged 20 to 30 years old. We've also developed a market relevant product collaboration with designer Feng Chen Wang, famous for her deconstructive approach as featured in Vogue and GQ. These initiatives are aimed at improving brand perception with Chinese consumers and bringing attention to new products. We're encouraged by the region's positive reception to new products like the Classic Clear, Fluffita and Disco Slide, but there is still plenty of work to be done to build brand E. We are optimistic about some early indicators in the UGG brands international business, revenue declined as expected for the first half of fiscal 2021, primarily due to efforts to reduce core product in the marketplace. While we don't anticipate meaningful improvement during this year of transition, UGG is making important progress and building a new foundation of diversified product acceptance, localized market relevance, and strategic partnerships, all designed to build a healthier brand with the ability to deliver growth over the long term.  The UGG brand's domestic success is built on this model of fashion credibility through authentic collaborations, social influencers and PR seeding, and we believe this approach will translate well to our international markets. First half performance gives us the confidence that we're on the right path of exploiting the strategy, building towards next year and beyond. Moving to Koolaburra, performance in the first quarter resulted from increased market share with top wholesale partners as well as improved category diversification through the expansion of men's and kids product. Last year Koolaburra established itself as the top brand in the sub $100 category which competes within the family value channel, and will look to maintain that position by building incremental market share this holiday season. While footwear remains the primary focus, Koolaburra continues to expand its lifestyle appeal. This fall the brand has partnered with Kohl's and QVC to develop a licensed loungewear collection, which comes on the heels of last year's successful collection of home licensed product. Both UGG and Koolaburra are well positioned to drive demand with their respective customer bases during this holiday season. However, I would like to remind everyone that we adjusted certain inventory buys at the outset of this year to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 in our business and this will limit the upside for both UGG and Koolaburra this holiday. However, if either brand fails to capture incremental upside due to these inventory constraints, we expect this will provide a clean marketplace for fiscal 2022 Shifting to the Performance Lifestyle Group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sunak. Starting with HOKA, performance was driven by increased adoption of our products through greater brand and product awareness, combined with compelling product refreshes, and a fast replenishment cycle. Among Deckers investments over the past few years, broadening the HOKA brands appeal beyond core runners has been a primary focus. Through market leading innovation, the HOKA team has refined products and expanded categories to attract a larger audience, while also maintaining the brand's authentic performance DNA. During the Quarter HOKA launched updates to several key franchises, each infused with both innovation and design upgrades, including the Clifton 7, Clifton Edge, Rincon 2, and the BONDI 7. Regarding the Clifton franchise, these styles have received considerable positive PR, which included features in Vogue, Gear Patrol and GQ, and SELF's 2020 Certified Sneakers Award. For the Rincon, originally introduced in July of 2019, the style has quickly become a top five seller for HOKA. The second edition of the Rincon has been so well received that it recently won Runner's World, Best Value Award, in their autumn, winter 2020 shoe guide. And lastly, in terms of notable product refreshes, the BONDI 7 hit shelves in September and features the brand's most inclusive size range, helping to expand the addressable consumer base for HOKA. Since its release online, the BONDI 7 has been the HOKA brand's top selling style. Propelled by these product updates and innovations HOKA domestic wholesale returned to deliver meaningful second quarter growth after the first quarter was disrupted by pandemic induced store closures. As mentioned in our first quarter called, HOKA delayed certain product launches to allow wholesalers to move to existing product, which provided an extra benefit to the brand's second quarter wholesale revenue growth. According to the NPD Group's retail tracking service, HOKA was able to both grow dollar volume and increase market share from 16.8% in August to 20.5% in August 2020, even though overall dollar sales of adult running shoes in the U.S. run specialty channel declined in August 2020, as compared to last year. The premium service atmosphere of Run Specialty stores remains an important acquisition vehicle for the HOKA brand, especially when considering the higher conversion rates experienced when customers try on our products. Globally, HOKA customer acquisition and retention online increased 81% and 92% respectively, as compared to last year, even though most of the brand's wholesale doors were open during the quarter. Part of these increases were due to the whole marketing team's efforts to optimize digital media targeting to acquire 18 to 34-year-old consumers. By strategically prioritizing this audience, HOKA experienced a 124% increase of consumers aged 18 to 34, led by recently released styles such as the Clifton 7, Clifton Edge and Rincon 2. Importantly, HOKA is driving direct-to-consumer growth across the globe. While still very small as compared to the U.S., international HOKA DTC has increased more than 150% in the first half of this year. Growing the brand's global online business is especially important as the inability to hold in-person events persist. We're dedicating marketing spend to build a HOKA audience online and stay relevant with existing consumers, through compelling product innovation. As we said in our first quarter earnings call, the $500 million milestone for HOKA is much closer than we previously anticipated. And with the brand heat in demand we're experiencing right now, HOKA has potential to reach $500 million by fiscal year end. The rapid acceleration of HOKA reaffirms our confidence in the brand's aspirations to eclipse the $1 billion mark over the longer term. Turning to Teva, growth in the brand was fueled by a 78% increase in acquired customers online. Teva is turning out to be the go to brand for the modern outdoor consumer, highlighted by the brand's founding roots in the Grand Canyon. Year-to-date through September, Teva maintained its position as the top outdoor water sandal brand in the U.S. in terms of market share, increasing market share over the last year in each of the past nine months according to the NPD Group's retail tracking service. Younger consumers have been the driving force behind this growth in Teva and the brand has experienced a 76% year-over-year increase in purchasers aged 18 to 34 years old, which was already the brand's highest indexing age bracket. Looking to fall, Teva is focused on capturing continued wallet share from this demographic to the brand's expanded hike and camping collections. Teva is already experiencing a surge in demand for the brand's Ember [ph] franchise, both online and with key wholesale partners such as REI, where product will be featured across all doors in their fleet. For Sanuk, brand performance was hurt by a soft department store channel. However, we were encouraged by the recovery within surf specialty as coastal towns saw an increased outdoor participation. Importantly, Sanuk posted a second consecutive quarter of robust direct to consumer growth, which was helped by a 40% increase in customer acquisition online. We are excited to receive feedback from the brand's online audience as Sanuk will be introducing new product innovations in the coming months. With respect to channel performance in the second quarter, all five of our brands experienced exceptional growth online driving our mix of DTC revenue to increase from 18% last year to 28% this year. This is despite the significant improvements in our wholesale business and inclusive of the recovery efforts within our own retail stores, as compared to the disruption experienced in the first quarter. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 86% versus last year. Approximately 95% of our own retail stores were open for the entire second quarter and as of this week all stores are open. In total, global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 74% versus last year's second quarter. Performance was driven by continued customer acquisition online, and a sequential improvement in retail performance as compared to the first quarter. Global wholesale revenue in the second quarter increased 2%, as compared to last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by HOKA, but mostly offset by a decline in UGG. The decline in UGG wholesale revenue differs from a regional standpoint, international UGG wholesale revenue declined due to the ongoing marketplace initiatives previously mentioned, while domestic UGG wholesale revenue decreased, as both pre recorders were conservatively adjusted at the height of the pandemic, and UGG has successfully shifted open a buy with retailers toward lower priced products such as slippers, Fluffs and kids footwear. The UGG wholesale revenue decline in the second quarter was somewhat tempered by our global effort to shift Q3 shipments forward, allowing our distribution center teams to focus on DTC fulfillment. To summarize, we are extremely pleased with our brands performance and operational execution in the second quarter. With the demand we're experiencing in our brands, we're anticipating operational challenges related to DC capacity, inventory, timing and availability, as well as third party shipping logistics that will limit the upside of our brands in the third quarter. Though less than ideal circumstances, I'm confident in our team's resilience and ability to manage the effects in our business, while protecting the sanctity of our strong brands. I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance, as well as some additional thoughts on managing the balance of fiscal 2021. Steve? Thanks, Steve. As I reflect on the unique first half, I'm proud of our organization's collaborative efforts to prioritize the consumer and deliver results. Our brand teams have done an excellent job delivering compelling and innovative products. Our omnichannel organization has been the engine driving product messaging, executing sales and providing analytics to inform future brand success, but paramount to the first task success this year has been our operations teams with heavy lifting being done by our product development teams, distribution center employees, customer service specialists, and all other individuals working throughout our supply chain. A huge thank you to every one of our employees for their continued execution of our strategies during these very challenging times. And along with performance, it is our organization's belief that we have a responsibility to continue to do business in the right way and Deckers continues to drive forward on ESG initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we've recently been recognized by Investor's Business Daily as the 15th ranked company in their top 50 best ESG companies list for 2020. This is an improvement from our number 20 ranking last year, and I note that we are the sole footwear or apparel company included in the top 50. To that end, I'm excited to share that our creating change FY '20 annual corporate responsibility report will be released tomorrow, highlighting the tremendous progress made by our global organization in FY '20. The report will be posted on our website and I encourage you to check it out. On that note, and in the spirit of making a positive impact, earlier this month Deckers held its first ever Art Of Kindness Week, which was an organized effort to encourage employees across the globe to give back through volunteerism. Collectively, I'm proud to report that our team's contributed more than 2000 hours to assist over 200 organizations, ultimately reaching many individuals who need help in these trying times. To remain focused on these types of efforts in the midst of a pandemic, while driving business growth is a testament to Deckers values and approach. It is these values exemplified by our dedicated employees and top performing brands that just yesterday earned Deckers the honor of being named Footwear News Company of the Year for 2020. I'd like to thank and congratulate our employees on this well deserved achievement. In closing, I have a high degree of confidence in our strategy, portfolio of brands and top tier operating model to navigate through these short-term challenges while also investing in our digital transformation to support growth over the long-term. Thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Thank you, Camilo. Yes, that's exactly right and we're seeing the consumer shift to other products and other categories. But generally speaking, whether it's slippers, classics, fashion boots, winter boots, we're seeing strong sell-through particularly in DTC but also at wholesale of all the categories, including ready to wear. So the demand for the brand, at a high level remains very strong, as you see in the accelerated interest over the quarter. Younger consumers are adopting the brand at new levels. We've increased our rate of 18 to 34-year-olds by over 180% for the quarter. And we're chasing the inventory where we can. So we feel confident that if there's no logistics disruptions, we'll be in good place. I think it's a healthy place for our brand to be in this chase mode. And, while we're focused on delivering Q3, we're really focused on the long term health of the brand, and the setup that this demand and healthy marketplace means for us over the long-term. We're just seeing a lot of potential right now. I'll go, so this is Steve, I'll go first. Really kind of as we think about where we're at, on the inventory and cancellations, it's why we're not giving guidance, right? We don't know what's going to happen, what kind of at wholesale. If everything holds up, can you, we won't have the cancellation issue. If things get more challenging from a logistics standpoint, some retail is closed, there may be cancellation. So that's really what we want to see kind of over the course of the next couple of weeks. I think it's too early to tell, and kind of why we're holding off on guidance. Thanks, Camilo. Yes, I would say so far, the teams have done an incredible job which I referenced in the script on managing our distribution and our logistics to date. We've had to put in place social distancing measures. We've had to pay more to employees for hazard pay, et cetera and recruiting has been a challenge. So they've done an incredible job working through this and working with the order book and the sales team to balance deliveries. So far, we haven't seen major disruptions, but the level of put through that we're going through right now is nothing compared to what's coming in the next couple months. And so that's really when the capacity of taking inbound deliveries that are in some cases delayed because of logistics from Asia Pacific, into the DC and at the same time turning around and putting product into the marketplace. That's where the pinch could come in the next couple of months and that's what we're really mindful of and planning for. So haven't seen major disruptions yet, within our control. We have seen them in logistics, but we're feeling confident of our ability to manage through it, but as Steve said, there's still so much uncertainty coming up ahead of us. With regards to kind of marketing, we are very surgical in our marketing, now. We have a center of excellence on digital marketing and spend around the world and we, navigate based off return on spend by brand channel and region. And so, we're cautious of the fact that where there may be constraints on upsides due to marketing, and we're putting our marketing dollars in places where we know we'll get the payoff such as HOKA to continue to grow that brand and you saw the 80% plus percent growth in Q2. In different markets, we're releasing some money to continue to assist international and the transition of the UGG brand and just, we're testing at the same time. So the marketing is paying off. We're adopting a younger consumer. We're getting multiple purchases from a younger consumer within the quarter. Normally, we wouldn't see purchases for UGG products more than once a year, traditionally a classic style. But now we're getting people, many consumers that bought the Fluff earlier in Q2 came back and purchased the UGG Clear. So the marketing is paying off. It's driving overall brand and awareness and buzz about the brand. I don't have a lot of concerns about missing sales and wasting marketing spend. I think we're very efficient on that and very targeted, and so far, it seems to be working really well. Yes, and as we said in Q1 call, and we'll continue to stay focused on, we want to take this opportunity to steal market share wherever we can. So we want to stay aggressive on marketing, continued to drop innovative, exciting products in the marketplace, bringing in younger consumers and we're going to have to continue to spend marketing dollars to do that. But it's really now about scaling the global opportunity based on the success that we're seeing in the domestic market. Yes, so ready to wear for UGG is less than 10%. It's mostly high single digits right now. It's a small business right now, but this ready to wear launch for us was really a test, a proof of concept test and the results have been phenomenal. The price points are perfect. The styling and the detailing is resonating with a younger consumer. And we launched it primarily in DTC and with Nordstrom and it was the first time, Nordstrom's ever put us on their landing page for apparel. They're incredibly pleased with the sell-through. We've had a lot of accounts calling trying to get their hands on the product. So for us what this means is there's just a lot of opportunity on this category in the next three to five years. So now we're just another opportunity for us to invest in design and creative talent and go-to-market talent for that category. So small, but very exciting from a launch perspective. HOKA apparel is even smaller. That's really early stages of development there. We are working with some folks externally to bring in some more talent to ramp that up. But the $500 million, the $1 billion numbers that we've put out there, we don't believe those need an apparel business to hit those targets. So it would be incremental to that. Those kinds of numbers at this point, but early days of HOKA, it's less than probably 3% of total sales. Thank you. Yes and then the setup for q4 and spring product looks promising as well. But it all depends on how we're able to get through q3 before we get to that point. Yes, I'll go first. What we've said historically, in its channel, compared to UGG, it is a little bit better. And so as the proportion of HOKA the gross margin implications are that, if we don't get into situations where we're having to discount, again we're dealing with a brand that is on fire, growing 80% of course [ph] which is crazy. We can hold full price selling. So as long as we can do that margins are by equivalent channel compared to UGG slightly better, but at the same time, then we're also spending more on marketing. So as a brand that is still being discovered by many, we spend considerably more on developing HOKA and brand awareness and consumer awareness with that brand. So from a gross margin standpoint, as long as the brand is hot and continues to grow like it is, and there's little promotion around that brand, it is incrementally positive. But at the same time, we're also investing considerably more in developing that brand and building that brand. Yes, I think I'll jump in on that. So keep in mind that, some of the deliveries and the business that we had intended to do in Q1 for HOKA ended up happening in Q2, because the wholesale being closed for most of the Q1, so hence, the 80 plus percent growth. But from an internal perspective, we don't have a lot of constraints on HOKA, the inventory, we're chasing the inventory as fast as we can, we're in pretty good shape heading into the back half of the year and inventory in HOKA. And the demand is still there, it's really relying more on kind of the macro environment, and an external factors for us. Sorry, just the biggest challenge that we're facing is just the, it's really last seven to eight weeks of the quarter on UGG where DTC ramps up dramatically. And at the same time, we're inbounding product and shipping out to wholesalers. It's that period of time where that's where we're exercising caution here, because there's so many different factors that could implement, get in the way of that being successful. But that's an UGG dynamic, less so on HOKA. Yes, it's a good question. I would say it's probably low single digits, under 5%, but healthy, sustainable, full price sales growth. And what's encouraging for me right now is to see, again, how many new young consumers have now adopted UGG into their consideration set, and they're choosing to come to our website, they're looking for new product, they're bright, they're buying from our websites more than once in a quarter across categories. We even see a healthy mix of consumers who bought footwear and ready to wear. We haven't seen that before. And so I think, if you look at the success of the Fluff franchise in the slipper or sandal, hybrid phenomenon that we've created, there's still a lot of longevity in that trend. It's less about being inside in slippers, and it's more about fashion. The amount of new consumers we have in our database and our ecosystem that we can now manage for an optimized the lifetime value of those consumers. The excitement that's happening in men's, we're launching Fluff product for men's, in the next couple of weeks with an exciting ambassador that you'll see shortly, the ready to wear opportunity. And if we can get international through their transformation and heading to positive territory again, you could see this as pretty healthy, sustainable, long-term growth. And we're optimistic but where the brand is, it's the healthiest and most exciting I've seen it since I've been here over eight years and so we feel good about the potential going forward. Thank you. Thanks. Yes, I'll take that one. Again, we haven't given guidance. But I think the way to think about really kind of the back half is you start getting up against the kind of bigger numbers. So Q1, Q2 are huge on a percentage basis, because those tend to be kind of smaller quarters. And now as you get into really the back half, you're up against kind of bigger numbers. So the expansion that you saw in the first half is not necessarily indicative of what you'll see in the second half. Clearly, we're going to have similar impacts from the changing dynamic. The impact will not be as much as what you saw, really, in the first half. Well, I think, you know, it's obviously still founded in core authentic running and continuing to be a leader in that category. In some cases, we're seeing, we're number two, in some cases, number one market share already, but the difference between us and the number one, market share holder, which tends to be Brooks, generally speaking, we could almost double our market share, and still be neck-and-neck with Brooks. So there's still a lot of opportunity in the core run specialty channel. The two things that get me most excited are just the expansion to a broader set of consumers. So it's, more, consumers that aren't just buying it just for running, it's everyday athletics or lifestyle. And we're starting to see, that broad base of consumers being attracted to the brand, for the performance attributes that it provides. We still want to keep our distribution tight. We're focusing on our tight ecosystem of very selected wholesale partners key accounts, and then driving e-commerce. So we can optimize that business for the long term. But I think the real unlocked to the $1 billion is continued acceleration of our EMEA business, particularly online. We've made quite a few investments over the last year to allow the e-commerce business there to flourish, and we seeing positive results on that, but it's still small compared to the US. And then I think when you think beyond $1 billion, it's really Asia Pacific, and we're just getting started in China. Obviously, that's a massive opportunity for us. But, we think we can get to that $1 billion mark with real strong growth continuing in the U.S. and accelerated growth in EMEA and then beyond that is just, even more upside once we get into those territories in Asia Pacific and newer categories. All right, thanks, John. Yep, sure, Sam. So UGG wholesale for the quarter was $292 million, HOKA was $108 million, Teva was $18 million, Sanuk was $6 million all else was call it $28 million and then our DTC was $172 million. Yes, in my sense, it's been obviously challenged because of the COVID situation, both in Europe and Asia Pacific, particularly China. That being said, we have seen some signs of promise with category adoption. So the phenomenon of the Fluff franchise in the U.S. hasn't really hit Europe or China yet. But in the last weeks of the quarter, we're starting to see some excitement around those categories, younger consumers positive strong sell-through of those categories, but also the brand. So, the increased marketing, the focus on PR, and collaborations, the new ambassador that we signed in China, those are all so far showing positive results, not big enough to move the total country needle because we still have some scarcity, work to do as far as resetting the classics business. But people are starting to see these, the UGG brand as a more fashion relevant brand than they have in the past. So I would say you'll start to see return to growth probably next fall in those markets and gives us, an indication of where we can go from there. But I think the work that the teams are doing right now, and the way we're shifting investments in our approach to be tailored to each of those markets, is working well. The teams are doing a great job. And I think you'll start to see, like I said that return to growth probably next fall into the FY '22 and beyond. I don't have, yes, we don't have the exact. Yes, the opening date on that is November 19, Sam. Yes, just so I'm clear on that, Sam when you said Q4, you mean our Q3. Yes, it is. Yes, it is really more just about constraints. So one will be from a, from retail how much traffic is allowed in stores, some of the mall based stores? What do the malls look like? Can people get in? So that's going to be kind of the one constraint. And then I would say, as I mentioned before, just externally, it will be what shipping capacity looks like. So the more we can direct e-commerce, and the more we can capture early is beneficial, right? It helps us navigate, I think some of the what I'll say are macro level constraints that are more out of our control, we're doing the best that we can kind of that's under our control, which is really about inventory management, bringing more product in this year than we did a year ago, and a quarter where we have constraints as we have lower inventory going into Q3. So those are all the things that we're working with, and trying to get to the consumer the demands there. They're showing up online. We are confident in our ability to kind of fulfill that if there are not constraints in place, but we know there's going to be some, so... Yes, so it's more wholesale focus, just be able to get inventory through the pipeline and chasing inventory. DTC, we still think we'll be able to have -- show some growth there. We're up against big numbers last year. If you remember, last year was a very strong quarter for us, particularly in DTC and stores. So that velocity is going to be hard to comp, but we're confident that DTC continued to be strong. And the last thing I'll say, before we end the call, and all this is 15%. growth in this environment is exceptional, but I can't stress enough how hard it is, and how hard people are working to ship to be able to cover this kind of increased demand and our distribution centers and our online businesses and chase this inventory is really hard to do. And I give our teams a ton of credit to be able to do that. And we're heading into, the biggest, you know, in some ways, the demand for our brands has never been stronger, but we're heading into the most uncertainty we've ever faced. And we have more demand on our website in our straining our systems than we've ever seen before. We're handling it extremely well so far. But like I said, when we get into these last few weeks of November into December, and that pinch point, for getting product to consumers, that's the area that we're really cautious about. Because this is hard work and being able to ship this quickly with those kinds of shifts in consumer demand is a strain and we're handling it well. But that's where we're focusing on providing some caution there. Thank you, Sam."

            "name": "Steven Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back at the past six months, we are proud of how our business has performed over the opening half of our fiscal year. In the midst of a global pandemic, while consumer behaviors are rapidly shifting with changing lifestyles, our brands and product offering have been placed in a unique position. And as demonstrated by our results, our product proposition is resonating with consumers, helping to drive an exceptional quarter. In particular, UGG has benefited from consumers working and learning from home, as the brand has been known to provide consumers with a feeling of comfort and security, and at the same time, HOKA benefited from its increasing awareness and positioning within the expanding active category. These trends helped drive attention to the work our brands are doing, and created awareness of our innovative line of products. While much of the current environment remains uncertain, we continue to focus on delivering great products that amplify our brands and meet consumer demands. Now for more detail on our second quarter results, revenue in the second quarter was $623.5 million, up 15% versus the prior year. Performances compared to last year was primarily driven by global HOKA growth of 83%, which experienced balanced gains across all regions and channels, but also benefited from first quarter product launches that were delayed to the second quarter and global UGG growth, which was up 3% versus the prior year to $415 million. This increase for the quarter was driven by robust global direct-to-consumer growth of 69% as well as approximately 25 to 30 million of earlier global shipment of product to wholesale and distributor accounts as we worked to decrease some of the logistical load on Q3. Although as expected, the overall wholesale UGG business experienced lower revenue for the quarter versus last year, as many wholesale partners planned more cautiously this year due to uncertainty at the onset of the pandemic, as well as the impact of our international reset. Gross margins in the second quarter were up 80 basis points over last year to 51.2%. Gross margins increased due to favorable channel mixes, DTC increased as a proportion to the total business, favorable brand mix with the sizeable increase in HOKA volume and benefits from favorable exchange rates. SG&A dollar spend was $190.4 million, up 8% from last year's $175.9 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and warehouse costs that were partially offset by savings from travel and retail expenses. This all resulted in an earnings per share of $3.58, which compares to $2.71 in last year's second quarter. The $0.87 improvement versus last year was primarily driven by a higher proportion of DTC and HOKA business with offsets from lower UGG wholesale revenue in greater marketing spend and warehouse costs. Our balance sheet remained strong and as of September 30, cash and equivalents were $626 million, up from $178 million at September 30 of last year. Inventory was down 13% to $484 million from $559 million at the same time last year. And we had $9 million in short term borrowing under our existing credit line as compared to $13 million last year. Our existing credit lines have an available balance of $463 million and during the quarter we did not repurchase any shares. During this period, we historically provide an update on our sheepskin pricing. We continue to see stable prices in the sheepskin market, and we expect no change in our sheepskin costs for fiscal 2022. Please note, this does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year, as our sheepskin costs are only one component of our gross margins. As we've now completed the first half of fiscal 2021, we remain disciplined in our approach to planning the second half of the year as we are aware of the unique circumstances surrounding the upcoming holiday season. We are mindful of shipping constraints during the upcoming peak, including not only our own operations, but also the operations of third party shipping and logistics services that we utilize. The logistics infrastructure, both internal and external, will continue to be tested by current challenges paired with unknown pandemic developments, which could be significantly impacted by a second wave of the disease, or any impacts from government orders or restrictions. While remaining vigilant, we will tightly manage the business and drive opportunities where we see potential for success, all with our primary focus on the long-term health of our business, and a continuation of driving success through our strong brands and innovative product offering. Looking to the back half of fiscal 2021, we're conscious of the historical size and relevance that our third quarter represents to full year revenue and earnings. In a typical year, the three months representing our third quarter equates to more revenue than we've recognized over the first six months. This dynamic combined with the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic place additional pressure on our third quarter this year, and may lead to reaching capacity thresholds that have yet to be experienced year-to-date. These capacity thresholds will be tested at our retail stores. Given that the October through December in store purchase volume typically represents two to three times the volume of any other three-month period. Additionally, while we are comfortable with current inventory levels in a year where we tempered inventory buys at the outset to reduce risk, we may see demand outpace supply with certain product. In these cases, we will be challenged with meeting the in-season demand, but at the same time, it will continue to drive brand heat, encourage full price selling and result in a clean marketplace for the fourth quarter and beyond. With all that, said and given the continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we will once again not be providing specific guidance for fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will update some of the major themes of our business. For context, we observed complex pandemic impacts in the first half of the year, including some tailwinds from the acceleration of e-commerce, brand heat and attention resulting from changing consumer trends, extended consumer adoption of categories providing the unique comfort of UGG and heightened consumer awareness of HOKA. While we anticipate that some of these trends may continue to provide opportunities, they may be dampened by the headwinds yet to be experienced, that are particularly relevant during our peak season in the back half of the year. Specifically, pressure from shipping constraints with third party providers, higher costs associated with our own warehouse operations in the current environment, product scarcity on key styles that are selling faster than anticipated, and increased marketing cost to capitalize on the momentum of our brands and stay top of mind with consumers. With these considerations in mind, we are approaching the back half of fiscal 2021, with the possibility that UGG revenue may fall below last year levels if the brand is up against potential capacity constraints, some earlier shipments into Q2, retail traffic pressure and continued work with our international business reset. And as Dave mentioned, we continue to see growth with HOKA, but at a lower rate than experienced in the first half, yet on the path to $500 million. And we anticipate higher expenses resulting from marketing spend to keep our brands top of mind, warehouse costs for safety measures and higher wages and increased IT expenses as we build out appropriate support systems for our accelerating e-commerce platform. Before I hand the call back to Dave, I would like to say how pleased we are with the results of our first half. As it gives us confidence that the organization can manage through the current near term challenges, while remaining committed to our long-term vision. Our brands are in a great place. The company is well positioned, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Sure, Camilo. I'll go first and then maybe Dave can jump in. Absolutely kind of what you said we are taking a look at. So with inventory down 13% we are comfortable with where we have inventory. As I said, at the onset of the pandemic, we did make some strategic reductions in styles. What we've seen really over the course of the last six months is an acceleration on certain styles, specifically, kind of slipper/sandal categories, we've done very well. And as a result of that we have run short. Now, in the time since then, we have looked to bring more inventory in and we're in the process of doing that. So, we intend to bring more inventory in this quarter, as well as Q4 that will help kind of fill out some of those shortages on styles, colors, sizes. But if there's disruption that will create some challenges logistically, so we're doing a lot to overcome that. We're bringing things in kind of as quickly as we can with those identified styles and where we may be short, we are steering customers to styles that we have more in stock on. So all of the above, right? We want to take advantage of the brand heat that we have going, the consumer demand that's out there for these styles. We want to use that then as an opportunity where we have scarcity to push him into other products that we do have in style. Yes, exactly. To your question on kind of longer term, we're looking at this right now. We just had a conversation with the Board a few weeks ago. I guess the best way to think about it is we're committed and we've proven that over the last three plus years to this mid teens operating margin. But there is going to have to have to be some investment in the next coming, one to two years to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that we're now seeing. Our long-term strategy through COVID has actually probably been accelerated with the shift to e-commerce, younger consumers coming in, the increase marketing spend. But we're going to need to invest in, further capabilities to optimize that e-commerce engine even more than we already have to provide better dead data and analytics, capabilities, systems improvements, and just continue to fuel the growth of these brands through marketing, our marketing is paying off tremendously right now and we increased our marketing spend over the past quarter by 30%. So this is one of those situations where, the engine is firing on all cylinders, but we need to keep it going. So I would say we're, you can count on us to deliver on mid tier operating margins, whether we get up, above 16%, 17%, 18%. The opportunity is there but it all depends on how fast we're going to have to invest in the mid-short to mid-term to be able to keep the top line going at, what we're shooting for is high single digits, double-digit percent growth over the next few years. Thanks, Camilo. Yes, and I think, Paul, just to add on that, I think the other thing on the constraints is really third party logistics, so we are hearing from third party freight companies logistics constraints. And that's going to be really universal. So that is one thing we're keeping a close eye on. So one is kind of constraints within really what we control, but also what's outside of our control. And we are seeing signals around that. So that's something that we're going to watch carefully, and look to find alternatives to work around some of those situations. Kind of on the marketing, just to add to what Dave said, where we are marketing to certain styles that may be low on inventory, there is an opportunity to shift some of that marketing. So to the first question to Camilo said, we can start to shift some of that marketing to product that we have in stock. So we have an opportunity to kind of move that in stock. And then I think the other important component is really our international reset. We can use money. So this is not just about domestic, it's about how we can accelerate some of our international reset, and deploying some of that marketing money around to kind of repositioning our brands and products and awareness in the international markets. Thanks, Paul. Yes, so Jon, again, we're not giving guidance. What I wanted to call really to attention is, we're dealing -- we're kind of in the middle of a pandemic we're dealing with constraints. And so we have seen growth in the first half. As I mentioned, and mentioned on last call, we're looking and did successfully move some product in Q2 that would traditionally go in Q3. And so it really depends. And again, it kind of this is again, why we're not giving guidance is, it depends on what happens. If it's a clean Q3, but given everything we're seeing, it's hard to see no disruption in Q3, that's how we're kind of looking at UGG and planning for it. So, that's -- I just want to provide a little bit of caution as we think about it, there's been some shifting in product. We have, because of the onset conservative cuts that we made in terms of inventory, we're up against some constraints on inventory. So we're going to do the best that we can, but it's going to be work, and we're working against some external factors that we're going to have little control over. Thanks, John. Thanks, John. The strength of DTC, upside from a percent growth perspective is more dramatic in UGG, HOKA is more just kind of holding steady as the trends that they've been on. But the UGG business from a DTC perspective is super strong. Yes, I'm trying to remember what your first question was. Yes, Dix. Yes, so yes, the 11 store test has been going very well. They're very pleased. The sell-through has been strong. We tested with them, it was like three or four years ago, a small test and the results were not good. It's a whole different ballgame now. So again, we're managing that relationship, closely pleased with the results and what they're selling. We're not looking to expand dramatically with those with that account just yet. Again, it's just very strategical and methodical approach as to how and if we go much bigger in Dix, but so far, the results are very promising. In down the road, we're also exploring opportunities with the Footlocker banner as well, early and ongoing conversations there yet, but still, really cautious about the timing of when we go into those new accounts. Yes. So it's on Fifth Avenue. It's right across from the NBA store on Fifth Avenue. Tremendous location, highly visible two floors, lots of windows, great foot traffic, both local and tourists going by there. It's our largest store ever. Two floors and it's going to showcase all the ready to wear a new store design be much more fashion, focused than we have been in the past, lots of color and excitement. And then some great storytelling an experience for the brand with an elevated service model for omnichannel capabilities and testing a lot there and then a new mobile POS system to go along with that. So there's a lot to be excited about. Obviously, the timing, we wish was better. But this will be a catalyst for the brand globally. And we'll be looking to roll out the new store concept to key partners and other flagship locations, as time permits over for the time is right over the next coming years. But, there's great storytelling that we're going to be able to do and I'm excited for everybody listening and the consumer to go in and experience the other ready to wear collection and a new look for the face of UGG. Go ahead, Sam. Thank you, Sam."

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have devastating effects around the world, we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities where we operate. On our May call, we detailed our strategic approach to managing the business through this pandemic. I believe the work we have done so far this year and over the past few years has created an important foundation. Though we still expect there to be additional hurdles to overcome later this year as we approach the peak season for our largest brand. Before I share our results for the quarter, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their continued commitment to working through these challenging circumstances, helping to deliver a solid first quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, revenue was up 2% versus last year to $283 million, gross margin increased over 300 basis points to 50.3%, and we delivered a loss per share of $0.28. Many of the trends we outlined at our May call remained largely consistent through the balance of the first quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business was robust throughout the quarter, driven by triple-digit online growth in both the UGG and HOKA ONE ONE brands. However, this was mostly offset by the headwinds experienced from both owned retail store closures, as well as some wholesale doors remaining closed during a portion of the quarter. Our first quarter performance benefited greatly from the organizational foundation we've invested in over the past few years. In addition, certain areas of our business benefited from the shift in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic, with our ongoing key strategies amplified and accelerated by some of those trends. Omnichannel capabilities have been a key area of investment. With a distinct focus on bolstering our e-commerce competencies where we've added new targeting efficiencies, analytical tools, upgraded talent and enhanced global accessibility with our online platform. Thanks to these investments, our digital marketing and e-commerce teams are able to efficiently and effectively transition content to authentically realign with the new marketplace realities created by the pandemic, including efforts to engage with consumers to virtual events and programs. UGG was able to adjust its plan for Pride to create a virtual prom for all event in partnership with Tommy Dorfman. HOKA had originally planned a series of in-person events surrounding the launch of the Clifton Edge. But the brand transformed those plans into the virtual challenge in partnership with Strava. As our brands adjusted plans for in-person events to virtual, they also shifted marketing mix towards the top of the funnel in an effort to reach a new and diverse set of consumers. These are just a few examples of how our brands were nimble in optimizing sell-through of the powerful product and narrative by modifying their marketing plans amid changing marketplace conditions. Beyond our investments in digital and PR, another key area of focus has been reducing the company's reliance on core UGG product. UGG has successfully diversified its product mix through investments in innovation and design to build a counter-seasonal assortment that complements the core product offering, while continuing to manage the brand's domestic allocation and segmentation strategy. And lastly, we have invested and will continue to invest in the HOKA brand to drive global growth and build on the brand's momentum to increase brand awareness and consideration. The strength of our e-commerce and digital marketing platforms, fueled by adaptive marketing tactics, created demand for counter seasonal UGG products and continued HOKA momentum, driving Decker's success in the first quarter. Shifting to the brand highlights from the quarter, starting with the Fashion Lifestyle group. Global UGG revenue in the first quarter was down 10% versus the prior year to $125 million, driven by a 49% decline in wholesale, which was primarily caused by the COVID-19-related wholesale door closures. Partially offsetting the decline in wholesale, The UGG brand experienced a 53% increase in its direct-to-consumer business as e-commerce was able to more than make up for the lost volume from our owned retail store closures. Online strength was fueled by an accelerated shift to consumer demand to online platforms and supported by the investments we have put behind our e-commerce business, resulting in a triple-digit increase in both acquired and retained consumers as compared to last year. We understand that some of these newly acquired individuals likely previously engaged with the UGG brand through a brick-and-mortar experience. But we welcome the shift in consumer purchasing to our online platform and will continue investing in the channel. Correlating to the sizable customer acquisition, the brand saw a substantial acceleration of UGG loyalty enrollments in the first quarter as compared to last year. We are especially encouraged by the UGG brand's incremental loyalty additions as members typically purchase the brand more frequently and are more likely to purchase multiple product categories. For the first quarter, loyalty members accounted for nearly 40% of direct-to-consumer revenue, which compares to 28% for the same period last year. From a regional perspective, the domestic UGG business maintained the momentum experienced throughout fiscal year 2020 with revenue growing in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to last year. Domestic performance was fueled by 18 to 34 year-old consumers purchasing online as ugg.com saw a significant increase in consumers within this age group, representing over 40% of total online purchases in the quarter. Internationally, UGG declined versus last year primarily related to COVID-19 store closures, the multiyear marketplace reset in Europe, and the brand having a smaller e-commerce presence relative to the U.S. market, making it more challenging to offset the volume loss from retail stores. In terms of product highlights, the UGG brand experienced global success with its slipper business through innovation of emotional and comfortable product that resonated with a broad range of consumers. We believe the gains in UGG slippers were due in part to COVID-19 related to work-from-home mandates as people seek out casual and comfortable shoes to wear in their homes in addition, the Fluff franchise's continued expansion and momentum. The Fluff Yeah style is the brand's top ranked style in terms of revenue in the first quarter for the second year in a row. And its companion style, Oh Yeah, was number two in its introductory season. Both styles are resonating well in driving meaningful growth in both women's and kids sizing, suggesting somewhat of Mommy and Me trend. In fact, the Fluff and Oh Yeah styles drove nearly half of the total purchases by 18 to 34-year-old consumers. We believe that this hybrid slipper/sandal phenomenon that UGG created is here to stay, as the brand continues its cycle of innovation to deliver authentic product updates for new and existing consumers. Beyond the Fluff franchise, many of the heritage slipper styles such as the Scuff, Coquette and Tasman experienced nice growth, which we believe was both incremental as well as some pull-forward demand from later in the year. We were excited about the UGG brand's recent performance with spring and summer product, especially given the brand has not typically been top of mind for the consumer this time of year. According to Google Trends, UGG experienced a 76% increase in search interest during the first quarter, underscoring the progress the design team has made developing a product that resonates with consumers during the spring and summer months. The UGG team is targeting the conversion of newly acquired consumers to repeat purchases throughout the balance of fiscal 2021. Turning to the Performance Lifestyle Group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk. Beginning with HOKA, global revenue for the first quarter increased 37% versus the prior year to $109 million. HOKA was able to grow both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, primarily due to the size and strength of its domestic e-commerce business as well as the rapid expansion of distributor volume internationally. Expansion of the HOKA brand internationally has been a great indicator of the accelerating consumer appetite for HOKA outside of the U.S., specifically within Europe. We feel the brand is resonating due to the frequent introduction of compelling product and powerful story talent globally. Digital growth in and customer acquisition have been a focal point building the HOKA ecosystem over the past few years. With the accelerated shift to online purchasing, our investments in digital had become even more critical. During the quarter, HOKA direct-to-consumer experienced triple-digit revenue growth, aided by a similar triple-digit increase in customer acquisition as compared to last year. Like UGG, we believe some of the online consumer acquisition may be attributable to consumers who have purchased HOKA before at wholesale, but due to store closures, have now migrated to our website. Given the brand's marketing strategy has traditionally included in-person-based activities, we're thrilled by the HOKA team's ability to accelerate online engagement and further cement the brand's digitally led approach. There have been numerous initiatives to help drive digital engagement with the HOKA brand in the first quarter, including the brand sponsorship of the virtual IRONMAN racing series as well as the HOKA partnership with Strava to create the Ekiden challenge. In continuing its sponsorship at the IRONMAN racing series virtually, HOKA was able to stay connected with its core consumers and potentially reach a new audience who may be following Ironman events while most other sports are on hold. Ekiden is about moving forward together and bringing out the best in each other. It's a relay-style running race that originated in Japan. Over 400,000 people across the globe participated in the Ekiden challenge, which helped create a new method of connection with consumers in the absence of in-person events, and afford HOKA the opportunity to learn more about its consumers. The challenge was designed to coincide with the launch of the Clifton Edge, which is the latest innovation from HOKA, and has seen strong consumer demand since its introduction in early July, particularly in Europe. The HOKA brand proved to be in a position of strength during a period where many brands struggle to grow, proving the brand power it is developing. We'll look to continue fueling the HOKA brand's momentum for the balance of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Moving to Teva. Global revenue in the first quarter was down 8% versus the prior year to $35 million. Teva performance included a notable acceleration of its direct-to-consumer business in the back half of the quarter. For the quarter, DTC represented 39% of the Teva brand's revenue, which was up from 19% in the previous year. And the overall revenue declined in the quarter, the brand experienced global growth with its universal franchise styles that now feature straps made from recycled plastic. For Sanuk, global revenue in the first quarter declined to $13 million. Similar to Teva, Sanuk is amplifying its focus on sustainability. Subsequently, at the end of our first quarter, Sanuk introduced its new SustainaSole collection. The collection is the brand's most eco-friendly shoe to-date, featuring recycled materials throughout the entire construction of the shoe. With respect to channel performance, overall, we saw significant strength with our online channel in the period, while physical retail experienced disruption from the pandemic conditions adversely impacting both owned retail and our wholesale business. Global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 74% versus last year in the quarter. Direct-to-consumer gains in the first quarter were driven by the strong consumer demand of our brands online, in particular with both UGG and HOKA more than doubling e-commerce revenue year-over-year. Again, we believe a portion of this incremental online demand continues to be spurred by consumers actively seeking products that provide comfort for the work-from-home environment, combined with an interest to exercising the outdoors. Due to the meaningful disruption of our retail store base throughout the quarter, we are not reporting a comparable direct-to-consumer sales figure. Global wholesale revenue decreased 27% versus last year for the first quarter. We experienced lower wholesale revenue across all brands in our portfolio, except HOKA, which was able to offset a domestic decline with higher international revenue. The pressure experienced in wholesale was primarily the result of pandemic-induced store closures across the globe. However, despite the decline of wholesale revenue, our partners also experienced growth within their e-commerce channels, which suggest our brands are taking market share from the competition. According to NPD's retail tracking service, for the months of April through June, each of our brand growth rates were more favorable than the overall marketplace. Before handing off the call to Steve, I'd like to give an update on the status of our operations and highlight a few dynamics to consider for the balance of fiscal 2021. Our Moreno Valley distribution center continues to operate at a limited capacity, due to increased social distancing measures, taken as a precaution to maintain employee safety. Our Moreno Valley DC team and third-party logistics partners continued to work through the challenges associated with shipping higher levels of product sold through our e-commerce channel, in addition to the increasing volume of wholesale shipments, as we head into peak season. As a result of these conditions, we anticipate higher costs associated with employee safety and increased payroll costs related to DC employees. We continue to adjust our retail store fleet operations in compliance with updated and ever-changing health and safety standards. To provide some context for our retail store operations during the first quarter, approximately 20% of our stores were open for the entire 90-day period. The average store was open for roughly half the quarter. As of this week, approximately 95% of our global stores are open, but in most cases operating at a limited capacity. Given the ongoing and uncertain pandemic conditions, which include meaningful local and regional differences and restrictions imposed on retail store operations, we foresee potential risk of additional store closures or limitations during peak periods. Similar to our owned retail stores, many of our wholesale partner stores were closed for much of our first quarter, but have since reopened with limited operations. We have continued to work closely with our wholesale partners to identify areas of risk and make the relevant adjustments to our order book. Given the significant portion of business remaining in this fiscal year, as well as the uncertainty around economic conditions and consumer sentiments, we still anticipate cancellations to outweigh the orders. In terms of our sourcing, during the first quarter, we operated with reduced capacity due to the implementation of social distancing measures and we continue to experience travel restrictions between country borders and production facilities. However, these disruptions have been mitigated thus far and at this time, we are not experiencing any major sourcing disruptions. Given the first quarter is historically very different from our other three quarters in terms of channel and brand mix, and the first quarter was especially unique this year due to the marketplace conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that this will not be a typical year. I'd like to take a moment to recognize some of the dynamics we are observing and that should be considered for the balance of fiscal 2021. In the first quarter just completed, approximately 49% of revenue came from direct-to-consumer, heavily weighted towards e-commerce, which is significantly above last year and our typical quarter; 38% of revenue came from HOKA, which is well beyond last year and the average quarter and less than half of the revenue came from UGG, which typically represents over 70% of total company revenue on a full year basis. While we expect direct-to-consumer and HOKA revenue to increase as a proportion of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, we do not expect to repeat the levels of penetration experienced in this first quarter. Additionally, though we're optimistic about the UGG brand's start to fiscal 2021, the brand is a long way from its peak holiday time frame, which we are expecting to be highly competitive and feature increased level of promotional activity across the marketplace. Starting in the second quarter, wholesale is expected to become a more impactful portion of the UGG brand revenue, especially as we move some customer shipments forward to help alleviate potential pressure during the third quarter at our distribution centers. Given the number of unknowns, we continue to approach the UGG brand's peak season with appropriate caution. To summarize, our portfolio of brands delivered an excellent quarter and an exceptionally challenging environment. I'm proud of our teams for their dedication and discipline to achieve our best first quarter result of the past nine years. Despite the first quarter traditionally being our lowest revenue quarter, I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our brand and look forward to building on that momentum for the balance of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The ongoing pandemic will undoubtedly present adversity throughout the year, but I'm confident in our team's ability to manage the effects on our business. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and provide some additional color on our strategy to manage the balance of fiscal 2021.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just detailed, we are extremely pleased with the organization's performance amidst tough marketplace conditions. And as of June 30th, the organization maintained its strong liquidity position above $1 billion aided by the performance of our portfolio of brands that drove positive cash flow for the first quarter and is inclusive of untapped credit revolvers, totaling $470 million. Our strategic approach to managing through the pandemic and its economic impact served us well in the first quarter. We will stay the course and continue managing our business tightly by leaning on our strong operating model, while also fueling our brands to drive competitive gains in market share. Now for our results. First quarter revenue was $283 million, up 2% versus last year, and slightly above the trends we outlined for the first half of the quarter on our May earnings call. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by HOKA, which increased $29 million over the same period last year. Offsetting the HOKA brand growth was a $14 million decline in UGG, a $5 million decline in Sanuk, and a $3 million decline in Teva as compared to last year. Given the difficult marketplace dynamics during the first quarter, we were pleased to see our online channel's ability to capture consumer demand as physical store locations largely remain closed. In addition, our online results benefited from efforts to drive consumers to our compelling product offering in our historically smallest revenue quarter. Gross margins in the first quarter were up 330 basis points over last year to 50.3%. This result was aligned with our view of the business as a favorable shift in channel mix resulted from reduced wholesale volume, including a reduction of closeouts and an increased penetration of e-commerce. We also benefited from the HOKA brand's growth and its corresponding increased mix of total company revenue. Moving to SG&A. Our dollar spend was $150.3 million, down 7% from last year's spend of $161.4 million. The decrease versus last year was driven by variable category reductions with the bulk of the year-over-year savings attributed to reduced travel and shifting a portion of marketing spend to later in the year. The combined effect of these items represent approximately $10 million of reduced operating expense in the quarter. Income tax benefits were lower than last year due to a smaller net loss this year and a discrete tax charge in the current quarter with last year benefiting from a one-time tax refund. Our first quarter performance resulted in a loss per share of $0.28 as compared to last year's loss per share of $0.67. The $0.39 improvement versus last year was driven by higher revenue mix of HOKA including benefits from a greater portion of DTC sales, higher revenue and profitability from our domestic UGG business as DTC performance was able to offset declines in wholesale, variable expense savings primarily related to travel and marketing with partial offsets coming from lower UGG international wholesale revenue, year-over-year declines in Teva and Sanuk, no tax benefit this year, and reduced interest income compared to the same period last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. And as of June 30th, cash and equivalents were $662 million, up from $503 million at June 30th last year, and up from $649 million at March 31st of this year, making the first quarter net cash positive. Inventory was down 8% to $435 million as compared to $473 million last year. Inventory levels were down partially as a result of the intentional phasing of later receipts in order to more closely align with the timing of anticipated demand as we move into later quarters. And we had no material short-term borrowings under our existing credit lines, which have an available balance of $470 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter as we paused share repurchase activity, placing an emphasis on liquidity and cash management. Share repurchase activity remains paused for future periods, although we may commence future repurchase activity under our existing Board authorization as management deems appropriate. Finally, given the continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we will once again not be providing specific guidance for fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will reiterate the major themes of our business and briefly outline our management thinking. We continue to approach fiscal year 2021 with expectations that total company revenue will decline year-over-year, though we believe HOKA will still experience growth, albeit at a lower rate than the brand's 37% increase in the first quarter. The Fashion Lifestyle Group will face headwinds related to further international softness and additional wholesale cancellations. And as our wholesale business approaches our peak period and we begin shipping higher volumes of product, it will be increasingly difficult for our e-commerce business to compensate in the same proportion we saw in Q1 with the continued disruption of the retail landscape. Our gross margins, while we saw a meaningful improvement in the first quarter, we don't anticipate these channel and brand mix dynamics to continue for the balance of fiscal 2021 as the wholesale and distributor proportion of the business will increase. And we may also see promotional pressure in the marketplace as we move into the peak holiday timeframe. Expenses will continue to be managed tightly as we work to preserve liquidity, but we will use the success we are seeing to dial marketing up as appropriate to continue driving consumer engagement. And we will face higher costs related to distribution fulfillment as additional safety measures and higher labor costs will be incurred. So as we look at the remainder of the year, we recognize there will be continued challenges ahead resulting from the new realities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are managing through these challenges that include social distancing measures in place at our Moreno Valley and third-party logistics distribution centers. Our critical focus is on maintaining employee safety as we are addressing increasing demands on our fulfillment capabilities. This will ultimately result in the organization facing higher expenses to ship less product. To help mitigate some of the workload impacts related to these challenges, we are partnering with wholesalers to potentially ship some product earlier, which could result in the cadence of revenue looking different than previous years. Additionally, given the ongoing economic pressure, we do not yet know how our core product will sell in this environment. Consumer sentiment looms large as a tough variable to predict in this uncertain economic environment. With higher unemployment, uncertain government action and the potential for further shutdowns, we remain cautious in our approach to planning the UGG brand peak season. I'd also highlight that UGG is still facing brand heat challenges internationally, and our actions to reset the European marketplace will continue to be a drag on fiscal 2021 revenue. With the first quarter now behind us, we are encouraged with our performance and are still in a position to play offense with our healthy and in-demand brands, but will remain diligent and course correct where necessary. As we stated on our May earnings call, the strategic approach we have outlined to manage our business through this pandemic is expected to result in short-term pressure on operating margins, but we maintain belief that this strategy will best enable our brands to emerge in a position of strength as we move beyond the pandemic. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks Steve. As I reflect on the quarter's performance, I remain encouraged by the power of our brands and their ability to capture consumer demand online. While myself and the management team are aware of the tough road ahead, we believe the foundation of our operating model provides our organization a unique opportunity to build market share as others are forced to take a more defensive approach. We plan to build on the first quarter success of our e-commerce and digital platform to accelerate gains in the channel, continue fueling the HOKA brand momentum, and build awareness through digital engagement with consumers, protect the marketplace management progress we've made in UGG by leaning into key styles and converting newly acquired customers to repeat purchases, and stay true to the Deckers organization values by innovating and developing creative solutions to challenging marketplace conditions. Our company brands and balance sheet are well-positioned to manage through this crisis. We will remain flexible to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisions in the best interest of our brands. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our longest tenured Board member, John M. Gibbons, as he plans to retire in the current quarter. I want to thank John for his 20 years of service on our Board of Directors. John's contributions including his time as our Chairman and his leadership of the Audit Committee have helped build the successful organization that we have today. John's leadership will be missed, and I'm thankful for his continued friendship. As we make this announcement, John asked me to express his gratitude for the trust and support of Deckers' stakeholders throughout his many years of service to the organization. We wish John the best in his retirement. Before I hand off to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to acknowledge the social movement happening across the United States over the past few months. The foundational belief of the Deckers organization is 'Better Together.' Our core values compel the organization to seek an active stance against racism, discrimination, and intolerance of any form. Deckers is an anti-racist organization, and we are actively taking steps to become better allies through continuous evaluation and improvement of internal practices, investments in education, and continuing to build a more inclusive workplace. Thank you to all of our employees for their exceptional efforts and commitment to our strategies. On behalf of Deckers, I hope everyone stays healthy and safe. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Camilo Lyon from BTIG. Go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thank you. Good morning -- good afternoon everyone. How are you?\nDave Powers: Good.\nCamilo Lyon: Doing well. So, thank you for all the details, and nice job on the quarter in a tough environment. I guess I wanted to first focus on last call, you talked about the mid-quarter performance. I believe it was down mid-single-digits. You ended the quarter down 10. And then you also talked about some forward shipments that were moved into this quarter. It sounded like as you're trying to alleviate some of the burden in your DC. Could you just articulate a little bit more around what happened in the quarter? And if at all, that's influencing how retailers are viewing their fall/winters orders with you, particularly domestically in light of the backlog, I think last time being flat.\nDave Powers: Right. Yes. So Camilo, I'll take that one. I think as we look at what happened in Q1 and on the UGG business, we were down. And that was really driven largely by wholesale being closed for the good, good portion of the quarter. And so we saw things really kind of ramp back up in business in terms of what we were seeing. I think that's what led to delivering the quarter a little bit better than kind of where we were at, call it, mid-May. So we finished the second half of the quarter a little bit stronger. The reference that we're making in terms of the second quarter, which is typically a high wholesale selling quarter, the cadence of that quarter tends to be more back half Q2 loaded. So that's really when we see historically the wholesale accounts beginning to take their orders. We've been working with them to -- in light of the social distancing and capability issues that we're going to have at our DCs, to take things earlier. We're beginning to see some of that take hold. So in Q2, we're beginning to see some wholesalers give us signals they're taking product earlier. We expect that to kind of continue through the quarter. And that's where it changes the shape of the quarter a little bit. So we'll see how that -- kind of how that plays out. It is all part of our strategy of taking some of the pressure off the peak period that will allow us to be more focused on fulfillment of our DTC channel as well as potentially if we're able to get follow-up orders on wholesale. So still a work in progress, I think we've seen a strong start to the second quarter. We know this year looks different than last. And we're just trying to smooth that out, where historically again, we see a lot of pressure on the back half of the quarter. We're trying to smooth some of that out to the earlier part of the quarter.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And I guess the second question relates to really the expense management and the shifts on marketing. Similar sort of line of questioning, maybe if you can just highlight how much of that was marketing pushed out? My guess is that that's probably going to be concentrated in the second quarter, the second fiscal quarter or maybe early third quarter. But just a sense as to what that is. And from a higher level, the ability to take expenses down like this, is this something that you've realized that you have become more efficient with, that you can start to carry forward more going -- as we go through the year, this year, next year and years beyond to create a faster leverage point in the business model? \nSteve Fasching: Yes, Camilo, I'll take that one. So a few things just on marketing. The first thing that was really encouraging for us is we found that our demand -- the demand for our brands was very strong, particularly UGG and HOKA. And so we were able to actually pull back on some of the marketing spend as the demand for online business was already there. A couple of other things we did is we -- due to the social distancing, there was a lot of creative work that we would normally do in Q1 that we just weren't able to do in this environment. But we did shift a lot of the marketing dollars to top of funnel and more PR related and user-generated content. So I think the teams have done a phenomenal job being flexible and agile and really managing the efficiency and the effectiveness of our marketing spend. And I think that was demonstrated pretty solidly in Q1 with their ability to shift to be of the moment with the conversation that's going on amongst our consumers, to shift the marketing spend on a daily, sometimes hourly basis to maximize return. And then just be smart with where we're investing it, to make sure we're getting the spend and it's worth our time in Q1. And what we found is there were some opportunities to keep that powder dry for later in the year, particularly Q2 and Q3 with the strength and the demand of our brands during this environment. So we're going to continue to use that as a lever to adjust spend and profitability as we go forward. But as we've said before, we are going to continue to use this opportunity to invest in our brands and drive the power of those brands and growth with the goal of creating more awareness, consideration and acquisition and also taking share.\nDave Powers: And then just also, Camilo, on that point aside from the market, and we indicated that a large portion of the savings in the quarter was related to travel. We'll be able to continue to save that in the current environment, but it will be offset, as we talked about in the prepared remarks with increased costs related to our fulfillment and DC costs. So you're going to see, as Dave said, increases in Q2, Q3 related to marketing as we invest in that and redeploy some of those Q1 dollars. We'll see higher costs related to fulfillment and distribution center costs. And we'll have some savings related to reduced travel.\nCamilo Lyon: Okay. So overall, we should expect to continue to see SG&A dollar growth for the balance of the year?\nSteve Fasching: I think that's a fair way to probably look at it.\nDave Powers: Yes, in line with business trends, but we do have the ability in certain areas to flex depending on the business trend. But the one thing we do need to make sure we spend is on DC to be able to deliver product to our customers and to our accounts.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. And then just a follow-up on my first question, I don't know if it was addressed. Just was there any change to the order book as time unfolded since the last call and stores reopened and your wholesale partners got a little bit better sense of demand, not only in their own stores or their online channels, but demand for your brand?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So I would say, Camilo, first, the demand for the brand still remains very strong. We have seen some cancellations as people are, kind of, getting back to business and seeing selling conditions. We indicated that we expected to see some and we have seen that. So no surprises. The brands are still strong. We have seen some cancellations, which we expected.\nDave Powers: Yes. And just one other thing to be aware of it, lot of our partners sold through lot of inventory in their stores. So, folks that had omnichannel capabilities where they could ship from store. They depleted those store inventories. But since then, they've been slow to reopen those stores and some of them not opened at all yet. They haven't had to refill the inventory at a store level. They're maintaining, obviously their e-commerce business. But that's another dynamic that we're going to have to keep a close eye on as we move through the quarter. \nCamilo Lyon: Got it Thanks so much guys. Good luck.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Camilo.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Hi, thank you. I wanted to start there first on inventory just to follow-up. I want to ask about how you're feeling about the inventory levels across the product lines for UGG and HOKA. UGG maybe looks like a few areas online that are alight today. And just as a follow-up to the order dynamic, are you seeing retailers trying to shift some of the risk back to you in terms of hoping to chase business later in the year? Just any color there would be helpful.\nDave Powers: Yes. Sure, John. As we look at inventory, clearly we're pleased with an 8% kind of reduction coming from UGG, and that's really, as you said, kind of driven by the strong performance that we've seen online. So product resonating with consumers and selling through very well online. We have increases in HOKA as that brand continues to grow very rapidly. We want to make sure we have inventory to support the growing level of sales. So we've seen an increase in inventory related to the HOKA brand. With UGG, kind of in reference of where you're seeing some products in, this year, what we have done is intentionally shift more products to later. Last year, we were receiving products earlier. So from a timing perspective, we're going to see inventory coming in a little bit later this year versus last year. That's contributing to the improvement in lower inventory that we're seeing this year. So from an overall inventory position, we're comfortable with where we're at. We've got inventory to support the level of sales that we're delivering. And it's making sure we're bringing in where we see that pickup in sales. So that's been an area of focus. And in cases, we are bringing more inventory and to support the level of online sales that we've been seeing. So feel good about where we're at and we're continuing to manage it very closely. \nSteve Fasching: Yes. And then just to add in on the whole sale shifting risk to us. I mean we are seeing a bigger demand and drop ship, and that's something we're evaluating closely from a cost and effectiveness perspective. And then wholesalers are also cautious. So they're making sure that they're only bringing in inventory if and when they need it. Certainly, UGG and HOKA and even Teva are strong brands in their portfolios, and there's still a lot of demand. But they are being more cautious overall in managing their inventory levels between stores and warehouse for e-commerce. \nDave Powers: Yes. And related to that, John, just on that too, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're working with wholesale accounts. So to your point, yes, some would like to defer. But given the current environment that we're operating and limited capabilities that we potentially have at DCs, we are encouraging wholesalers to take that product earlier because it will be hard. If they try to push it off to our peak period and we're fulfilling direct-to-consumer sales at the same time, it's going to be hard to do that. So we're working with them. We're getting positive, I would say, response in terms of a willingness to actually take some product earlier this year. \nJonathan Komp: Okay, great. And then maybe more of a product focus for the second half of the calendar year here, just curious first on the core book business. Dave, if you have any thoughts to share on headwinds or tailwinds that you see as you look at the business, and then more broadly for UGG and HOKA, just some of the extensions more important lifestyle that you've talked about in the past on the apparel side. Could you just give an update on plans for both of those and what you're expecting?\nDave Powers: Yes, happy to. It's really interesting to see the shift in categories within the UGG band. And traditionally as you all know, we've been traditionally heavily reliant on the core franchise and obviously this time of year, the business is smaller and particularly driven by core. So we've seen a significant shift with the phenomenon of the Fluff franchise. I do think that UGG has somewhat created this slipper/sandal hybrid category that we're seeing tremendous success in. We're going to continue to drive that. We're chasing inventory in colors, there's an incredible amount of new product iterations and colors, continuing to drop throughout the quarter. We're expanding that into spring and summer next year. So that is a category that we're going to go after it aggressively and continue to dominate in that category. And what's great about it is, we're seeing a younger, more diverse consumer adopting that category, particularly online. So that's very encouraging. As you know, we've been working at spring and summer for some time now. We now have an ownable position in there that's resonating, particularly in the U.S. and starting to gain legs in international. The classics business is still important. What we have done with the back half of the year is reduced inventory in things like fashion boots. We're still expecting people to be working from home and going out less than -- more reliant on comfort at home. We do think that work for home we'll have a -- probably -- could have, I should say, a positive impact on the classics business. But people are more casual, and they just want to get outside. But we're continuing to manage the mix of categories and inventory and feel really good about the trends that you're starting to see within these new developing categories. As far as lifestyle, actually both HOKA and UGG did have good sell-through of their lifestyle product in this quarter, although, both are very, very small for us this time of the year. But we are encouraged by what we saw in HOKA with the catalog drop and the reaction to that and some of the products online. So there's a good sign of opportunity there for the HOKA brand. And then we have a significant -- our mostly significant launch, I would say, ever this fall for UGG with some new product that we think is going to be pretty exciting and compelling. And you'll see that in partnership with Nordstrom and select doors, in our flagship store that we'll be opening in the tail end of the calendar year on Fifth Avenue and certainly on our e-commerce site. So this year is only about test the waters, feel the kind of reaction we get from some of the new products in lifestyle for both HOKA and UGG, and then ramp up from there. But so far, we're optimistic about the potential and what we're seeing in the -- reacting to the consumer.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Nikic from Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nDave Powers: Hi, Tom.\nTom Nikic: I want to ask about HOKA. You said that you would expect the growth for the balance of the year to be slower than what you saw in Q1, which sounds a little counterintuitive, given the pandemic impact in Q1. And I would think that in a -- more normal wholesale environment, you'd be able to do better with wholesale for the balance of the year. So is there any particular reason why you would think that HOKA would slow? And then also, just I want to ask about the test with the exporting good and how that's going so far?\nDave Powers: Yes. So, I think, at this point, we're very pleased, obviously, with the results of HOKA. This quarter performed better than we expected back in May, when we were talking about it. The success of the HOKA ecosystem, which we call it, which is really about balancing strategic access points for our consumer with key accounts and staying focused on a reduced tight distribution at wholesale and then really leveraging that to create awareness and excitement, but ultimately driving consumers to our website that we can cultivate for the long term. We're going to continue on that trend. I think, what you see in the rest of the year is reflected in how we've talked about it, is just the uncertainty that we see out in the environment with regards to wholesale. I still think we can drive excitement and revenue in e-commerce. But on a global scale, the wholesale is still the area that we're still cautious about. The brand has also delayed a couple of the product launches and to make sure that we can execute and keep the marketplace clean due to some of the store closures and wholesale. That's serving us well. So we're still optimistic. We're still planning on having a growth year, but we're just being a little bit cautious with the uncertainty on how things are going to pan out in the back half of the year for that brand. But still certainly, a strong important brand for our wholesalers, those that can open stores and have an online business, but continuing to drive the e-commerce business as a priority. With regards to DICK\u2019S, it's going very well. It's in about 11 stores right now. That's one we're taking slow cautious approach with. We want to focus on high sell-throughs, quality sales with that partner. And again, it's something where you can continue to evaluate, but it's off to a good start. DICK\u2019S is happy, we're happy, and we'll evaluate that within the mix of the ecosystem going forward.\nTom Nikic: Sounds good. Thanks very much and best of luck for the rest of the year.\nDave Powers: You bet. Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sam Poser from Susquehanna. Go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I hope everyone is great. A couple of things, one, can you give us -- you mentioned it was UGG. Can you give us the wholesale for the direct-to-consumer, year-over-year increase by brand, please, for the quarter? And then I have a couple more.\nDave Powers: The wholesale -- you said the UGG brand...\nSam Poser: You gave us the UGG wholesale, you gave us the wholesale increase in your prepared remarks. Could you give us the wholesale revenue increase for the balance of the brand? \nDave Powers: Non-UGG brands is what you're asking for?\nSam Poser: Right. For Teva, HOKA Sanuk and the other and other, yes.\nDave Powers: Yes, sure. So HOKA was up 10% on the wholesale. Teva on wholesale was down 30%, right. Sanuk was down wholesale 50%. And other brands was small, I mean, nothing, small dollars.\nSam Poser: Okay. Thank you. And then can you give us a little more color on this UGG shipping shift? And are you -- and in order to get the retailer, are you having them take not only goods earlier in the quarter, but are you trying to have them shift some receipts from Q3 into Q2 as well? And are you working with them by giving them extended dating on that product in order so they go with it? \nDave Powers: Yes. Yes. So what we're kind of yes to all of the above. What we're doing is within the quarter, we're trying to move things earlier, right, which we're working on and seeing some progress on that front. Additionally, as we get into Q3, we're encouraging them to look at taking deliveries in Q2. That's still work in progress. We're continuing to work on that. And where we're seeing a willingness to take product earlier, we're working with them to help facilitate that. And it really kind of depends on the circumstances in the customers, but where we can get them to take it earlier, we're definitely willing to provide and work with them and accommodating that.\nSam Poser: So if we think about the two quarters separately for UGG wholesale from a -- like from a year-over-year basis, do you expect Q3 to be like better -- like I mean, down because of the shifting down less than Q4 or up less, or however, you want to look at it, then I mean -- or sorry, Q2 up less than Q3 or not? How should we think about that sort of between quarters without telling us -- you don't want to guide. So -- but I mean should you think about Q2 on a year-over-year basis being better than Q3 or vice versa? \nDave Powers: Yes. So, again, looking at the quarter I think without giving guidance, just how we're looking at it because we don't yet know how much traction we're going to get in terms of how much of that product may shift out of Q3 into Q2. Ideally, what we would like to see is more product than say, what you saw a year ago, kind of coming into Q2, which would be then lower for that business Q3. So that October through December quarter, the more we could get moved into Q2, our September ending quarter, we would like to do. We don't know how successful we're going to be at that. Clearly, wholesale customers want their product. We would like them to get it and make sure that they have it and they're ready for the selling season. So, I can't answer that question. That's why we're -- part of the reason we're not giving guidance, but we are trying to move more of that Q3 wholesale into Q2where we can. \nSam Poser: And two more things, that's, one, because you want to make sure you can handle the direct-to-consumer during the holiday, number one. That's number one. And two on a separate issue, can you -- where are you on chasing that very strong slipper and slide business with UGGs right now? And just where are you with that? Because I hear the demand is -- you also talked about the demand there being very good.\nDave Powers: Yes. So just a couple of things on that, Sam. I can't underscore enough the importance of us focusing our Q3 DC efforts on our e-commerce business, despite that we expect to get an e-commerce in a short period of time, the last call it, six to eight weeks of the calendar year is going to be intense. And with social distancing challenges in our DCs, we really needed as many wholesale out quarters out as soon as we can. So, we're hopeful that our partners will be supportive of that, and we're seeing some success there. But this is such a hard year to call with regards to timing and what's going to happen in the quarter. So, we're doing everything we can to make sure that that happens. But we're really trying to make sure that we're ready and able to service the e-commerce business in that peak period because it's so critical and a lot of handling on the individual orders. With regards to the Fluff franchise, I'd say we're in pretty good shape. We were bullish on this from an order perspective. We've been supporting this category, seeing inventory going to buys from our categories into this as well as I said, there's a lot of newness coming in drops that will help fuel the excitement in demand. So, we do feel good about our position on that. Certainly, the demand is very high, and that's super exciting and we see that continuing not just in Q2 and Q3, but also intoQ4 as well.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Continue to success.\nDave Powers: Thanks Sam.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks Sam.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jay Sole from UBS. Go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Dave, I wanted to ask you about HOKA. You mentioned you were pleased with some of the growth you saw in Europe. And some of the storytelling there was sort of a factor in that. Can you just tell us a little bit about those stores you're telling and given the size of HOKA in Europe now? And what you see the prospects are for future growth going forward?\nDave Powers: Yes. Essentially, what we're seeing in Europe is a few things. One is we do have an emerging and strong e-commerce business there, but it's still small. And in comparison to the U.S., e-commerce internationally is something that we're focusing on and really trying to build. The growth percentages there are very strong, but it's still smaller as the total business. We did mention distributors in the script. We have a very strong distributor in the northern part of Europe, and they've been less affected by the COVID situation, so their orders are still strong and helping in the quarter. But the brand is certainly resonating. We launched the Clifton Edge this last month. Europe was very successful with that launch, and there was great demand for that product over there. But essentially what you're seeing, globally really not just Europe, is executing on a playbook that the brand has put together. And what that really is, is reaching a diverse consumer through real-life stories of our users. And so we're championing individual athletes who are making bold statements in the world and in their lives and using HOKA to improve and change their lives. And we're letting them tell their stories, and we're partnering with people who do that for us. And so that's creating a great level of awareness across a broad range of consumers and tapping into an emotional connection that is really powerful. And we've said from day one, we'll let the consumers speak about the product and let them talk about how it's affecting their lives and the performance of it. And that's the formula that is resonating. So we're continuing to do that with Humans of HOKA, storytelling and tapping into the virtual Ironman and some of our athletes, and leveraging even some of the smaller running groups on a local basis to use their content and their storytelling to really spread the word of the brand and create the authentic and meaningful connection with the consumer that we're seeing.\nJay Sole: Got it. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi Research. Go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, guys, Paul Lejuez. Two questions, one, I guess can you talk a little bit about the state of HOKA inventory within the specialty channel and how your retail partners have been able to sell-through product as their stores have reopened? And then second, you did mention you expect further challenges as a result of COVID. Are there any that did not show up in 1Q that you're already seeing in 2Q in terms of challenges? Or was that more of a general statement being cautious? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yes. I'll take the second one first. I think some of the challenges that we thought we would see, we didn't necessarily see it. And I think what we are seeing, we talked about this in the script is I would call it, there's an acceleration to the Fluff franchise and HOKA and also Teva from the work in home -- work-from-home environment where people either from UGG perspective want to be comfortable and are seeking out footwear that is comfortable, but still stylish. But also, they're trying to get outdoors and be healthy again, whether that's running or whether that's hiking or camping or going on family trips and national parks. This has been an accelerator, I think, for both HOKA and Teva at the same time as UGG. So that's a dynamic that we saw emerging, but it prove to be a lot more powerful than we thought. And so I definitely think we're benefiting from that. But certainly, if we didn't have the product that the brand's created and the innovation that we put into the marketplace along with the emotional connection in the marketing, we wouldn't be able to capitalize on that. So I think the brands have done a phenomenal job of taking advantage of the situation, being sensitive to the moment and connecting with consumers on an authentic and personal level, and driving the health of the brand. As far as HOKA inventory in the channel, early on the HOKA team did a great job of pushing out deliveries, so that the wholesale partners could sell-through existing inventories. They wouldn't get stuck with it. And they have been very focused on executing a clean marketplace, high full-price sell-through, very little liquidation in the marketplace. And that is continuing. And I would say, the wholesale inventory situation for HOKA, as well as our other brands as well are very strong, very healthy and not a lot of markdowns. But again, we're cautious going forward because we think the environment is still going to be very uncertain. But right now as it stands, the marketplace wholesale inventory is healthy and strong. \nSteve Fasching: Yes. And Paul, also just to add on to that, I think kind of what we're talking about too, keep in mind the significant increase in volumes that we're starting to talk about. So one difference between Q1and kind of later Q2 and Q3, we start getting into significantly higher volumes. And so that's where we want to make sure we're in a position to be able to fulfill. So when you hear us kind of all the things that we're trying to do is trying to mitigate some of that peak demand period and reducing the load on our DCs. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thanks. \nSteve Fasching: Yes. That's our biggest challenge, for sure. And then the other thing to just keep in mind that's important for everybody to understand is this mix of this quarter versus the rest of the year. It's going to be very different. So it's not only a very different quarter, it's the whole year in the mix of business and how -- and the cadence and flow of it is going to be something that we haven't seen before. But we're feeling good about how we're able to manage through that. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you, guys. Good luck\nSteve Fasching: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thank you. A Few questions for me. First, on the topic of e-commerce business and the social distancing protocols start hitting operations, what are some of the other things you guys are doing to help through core capacity as you get into that peak season? And I'm curious does it make sense to incentivize consumers to purchase earlier as well? \nDave Powers: Yes. We're -- the supply chain teams have been an exceptional job at managing not only the flow of product from a production standpoint, but also working with our partners and the sales teams on D.C. bypass. So the increase that we're seeing in D.C. bypass versus last year has been significant and meaningful, so that's been super helpful. Partners are willing in some cases have shown to be able to take some inventory earlier. And so those are the tactics that we're using. As far as incentivizing consumers to shop earlier, I think with new introductions of product, they're doing that. And I think when we get into kind of core classics business that is real business driver in Q2 and Q3, we can look at that, but we certainly don't want to get promotional or do incentives that are going to damage the brand or margins at the sake of getting people to shop earlier. But I think we'll get creative around it and just use the effective marketing and PR tools that we've developed to be able to drive excitement at the right times and try to get people to shop a little earlier. \nJim Duffy: And then I also wanted to ask a question on HOKA global reach. It sounds like growth has been very strong with international distributors. Historically, international has been about half the global pairs. Are the international pairs is now higher than the U.S.? And then how do you split the mix for HOKA brands of international between Europe and other regions? \nDave Powers: Yes. So from a unit perspective, I think where you're trying to go, Jim, is we're probably looking at equivalent units, right, that we have higher dollar revenue in the U.S. because of the distribution channels that we're using versus distributors internationally. We are seeing growth in both. So the international growth is coming on strong as units are catching up to what we're doing in the U.S. And then the second part of your question again was?\nJim Duffy: The mix of the international business that's from Europe versus other regions.\nDave Powers: Yes. So, Europe is definitely our strongest international region for HOKA. Japan, smaller market, doing very well and really just starting to get into China. So, Europe, by far, on the international front, biggest and most mature, but still growing very rapidly.\nJim Duffy: Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks Erinn and good afternoon, everyone. On behalf of the Deckers organization, I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have devastating effects around the world, we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities where we operate. On our May call, we detailed our strategic approach to managing the business through this pandemic. I believe the work we have done so far this year and over the past few years has created an important foundation. Though we still expect there to be additional hurdles to overcome later this year as we approach the peak season for our largest brand. Before I share our results for the quarter, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their continued commitment to working through these challenging circumstances, helping to deliver a solid first quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, revenue was up 2% versus last year to $283 million, gross margin increased over 300 basis points to 50.3%, and we delivered a loss per share of $0.28. Many of the trends we outlined at our May call remained largely consistent through the balance of the first quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business was robust throughout the quarter, driven by triple-digit online growth in both the UGG and HOKA ONE ONE brands. However, this was mostly offset by the headwinds experienced from both owned retail store closures, as well as some wholesale doors remaining closed during a portion of the quarter. Our first quarter performance benefited greatly from the organizational foundation we've invested in over the past few years. In addition, certain areas of our business benefited from the shift in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic, with our ongoing key strategies amplified and accelerated by some of those trends. Omnichannel capabilities have been a key area of investment. With a distinct focus on bolstering our e-commerce competencies where we've added new targeting efficiencies, analytical tools, upgraded talent and enhanced global accessibility with our online platform. Thanks to these investments, our digital marketing and e-commerce teams are able to efficiently and effectively transition content to authentically realign with the new marketplace realities created by the pandemic, including efforts to engage with consumers to virtual events and programs. UGG was able to adjust its plan for Pride to create a virtual prom for all event in partnership with Tommy Dorfman. HOKA had originally planned a series of in-person events surrounding the launch of the Clifton Edge. But the brand transformed those plans into the virtual challenge in partnership with Strava. As our brands adjusted plans for in-person events to virtual, they also shifted marketing mix towards the top of the funnel in an effort to reach a new and diverse set of consumers. These are just a few examples of how our brands were nimble in optimizing sell-through of the powerful product and narrative by modifying their marketing plans amid changing marketplace conditions. Beyond our investments in digital and PR, another key area of focus has been reducing the company's reliance on core UGG product. UGG has successfully diversified its product mix through investments in innovation and design to build a counter-seasonal assortment that complements the core product offering, while continuing to manage the brand's domestic allocation and segmentation strategy. And lastly, we have invested and will continue to invest in the HOKA brand to drive global growth and build on the brand's momentum to increase brand awareness and consideration. The strength of our e-commerce and digital marketing platforms, fueled by adaptive marketing tactics, created demand for counter seasonal UGG products and continued HOKA momentum, driving Decker's success in the first quarter. Shifting to the brand highlights from the quarter, starting with the Fashion Lifestyle group. Global UGG revenue in the first quarter was down 10% versus the prior year to $125 million, driven by a 49% decline in wholesale, which was primarily caused by the COVID-19-related wholesale door closures. Partially offsetting the decline in wholesale, The UGG brand experienced a 53% increase in its direct-to-consumer business as e-commerce was able to more than make up for the lost volume from our owned retail store closures. Online strength was fueled by an accelerated shift to consumer demand to online platforms and supported by the investments we have put behind our e-commerce business, resulting in a triple-digit increase in both acquired and retained consumers as compared to last year. We understand that some of these newly acquired individuals likely previously engaged with the UGG brand through a brick-and-mortar experience. But we welcome the shift in consumer purchasing to our online platform and will continue investing in the channel. Correlating to the sizable customer acquisition, the brand saw a substantial acceleration of UGG loyalty enrollments in the first quarter as compared to last year. We are especially encouraged by the UGG brand's incremental loyalty additions as members typically purchase the brand more frequently and are more likely to purchase multiple product categories. For the first quarter, loyalty members accounted for nearly 40% of direct-to-consumer revenue, which compares to 28% for the same period last year. From a regional perspective, the domestic UGG business maintained the momentum experienced throughout fiscal year 2020 with revenue growing in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to last year. Domestic performance was fueled by 18 to 34 year-old consumers purchasing online as ugg.com saw a significant increase in consumers within this age group, representing over 40% of total online purchases in the quarter. Internationally, UGG declined versus last year primarily related to COVID-19 store closures, the multiyear marketplace reset in Europe, and the brand having a smaller e-commerce presence relative to the U.S. market, making it more challenging to offset the volume loss from retail stores. In terms of product highlights, the UGG brand experienced global success with its slipper business through innovation of emotional and comfortable product that resonated with a broad range of consumers. We believe the gains in UGG slippers were due in part to COVID-19 related to work-from-home mandates as people seek out casual and comfortable shoes to wear in their homes in addition, the Fluff franchise's continued expansion and momentum. The Fluff Yeah style is the brand's top ranked style in terms of revenue in the first quarter for the second year in a row. And its companion style, Oh Yeah, was number two in its introductory season. Both styles are resonating well in driving meaningful growth in both women's and kids sizing, suggesting somewhat of Mommy and Me trend. In fact, the Fluff and Oh Yeah styles drove nearly half of the total purchases by 18 to 34-year-old consumers. We believe that this hybrid slipper/sandal phenomenon that UGG created is here to stay, as the brand continues its cycle of innovation to deliver authentic product updates for new and existing consumers. Beyond the Fluff franchise, many of the heritage slipper styles such as the Scuff, Coquette and Tasman experienced nice growth, which we believe was both incremental as well as some pull-forward demand from later in the year. We were excited about the UGG brand's recent performance with spring and summer product, especially given the brand has not typically been top of mind for the consumer this time of year. According to Google Trends, UGG experienced a 76% increase in search interest during the first quarter, underscoring the progress the design team has made developing a product that resonates with consumers during the spring and summer months. The UGG team is targeting the conversion of newly acquired consumers to repeat purchases throughout the balance of fiscal 2021. Turning to the Performance Lifestyle Group, which is comprised of HOKA, Teva and Sanuk. Beginning with HOKA, global revenue for the first quarter increased 37% versus the prior year to $109 million. HOKA was able to grow both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, primarily due to the size and strength of its domestic e-commerce business as well as the rapid expansion of distributor volume internationally. Expansion of the HOKA brand internationally has been a great indicator of the accelerating consumer appetite for HOKA outside of the U.S., specifically within Europe. We feel the brand is resonating due to the frequent introduction of compelling product and powerful story talent globally. Digital growth in and customer acquisition have been a focal point building the HOKA ecosystem over the past few years. With the accelerated shift to online purchasing, our investments in digital had become even more critical. During the quarter, HOKA direct-to-consumer experienced triple-digit revenue growth, aided by a similar triple-digit increase in customer acquisition as compared to last year. Like UGG, we believe some of the online consumer acquisition may be attributable to consumers who have purchased HOKA before at wholesale, but due to store closures, have now migrated to our website. Given the brand's marketing strategy has traditionally included in-person-based activities, we're thrilled by the HOKA team's ability to accelerate online engagement and further cement the brand's digitally led approach. There have been numerous initiatives to help drive digital engagement with the HOKA brand in the first quarter, including the brand sponsorship of the virtual IRONMAN racing series as well as the HOKA partnership with Strava to create the Ekiden challenge. In continuing its sponsorship at the IRONMAN racing series virtually, HOKA was able to stay connected with its core consumers and potentially reach a new audience who may be following Ironman events while most other sports are on hold. Ekiden is about moving forward together and bringing out the best in each other. It's a relay-style running race that originated in Japan. Over 400,000 people across the globe participated in the Ekiden challenge, which helped create a new method of connection with consumers in the absence of in-person events, and afford HOKA the opportunity to learn more about its consumers. The challenge was designed to coincide with the launch of the Clifton Edge, which is the latest innovation from HOKA, and has seen strong consumer demand since its introduction in early July, particularly in Europe. The HOKA brand proved to be in a position of strength during a period where many brands struggle to grow, proving the brand power it is developing. We'll look to continue fueling the HOKA brand's momentum for the balance of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Moving to Teva. Global revenue in the first quarter was down 8% versus the prior year to $35 million. Teva performance included a notable acceleration of its direct-to-consumer business in the back half of the quarter. For the quarter, DTC represented 39% of the Teva brand's revenue, which was up from 19% in the previous year. And the overall revenue declined in the quarter, the brand experienced global growth with its universal franchise styles that now feature straps made from recycled plastic. For Sanuk, global revenue in the first quarter declined to $13 million. Similar to Teva, Sanuk is amplifying its focus on sustainability. Subsequently, at the end of our first quarter, Sanuk introduced its new SustainaSole collection. The collection is the brand's most eco-friendly shoe to-date, featuring recycled materials throughout the entire construction of the shoe. With respect to channel performance, overall, we saw significant strength with our online channel in the period, while physical retail experienced disruption from the pandemic conditions adversely impacting both owned retail and our wholesale business. Global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 74% versus last year in the quarter. Direct-to-consumer gains in the first quarter were driven by the strong consumer demand of our brands online, in particular with both UGG and HOKA more than doubling e-commerce revenue year-over-year. Again, we believe a portion of this incremental online demand continues to be spurred by consumers actively seeking products that provide comfort for the work-from-home environment, combined with an interest to exercising the outdoors. Due to the meaningful disruption of our retail store base throughout the quarter, we are not reporting a comparable direct-to-consumer sales figure. Global wholesale revenue decreased 27% versus last year for the first quarter. We experienced lower wholesale revenue across all brands in our portfolio, except HOKA, which was able to offset a domestic decline with higher international revenue. The pressure experienced in wholesale was primarily the result of pandemic-induced store closures across the globe. However, despite the decline of wholesale revenue, our partners also experienced growth within their e-commerce channels, which suggest our brands are taking market share from the competition. According to NPD's retail tracking service, for the months of April through June, each of our brand growth rates were more favorable than the overall marketplace. Before handing off the call to Steve, I'd like to give an update on the status of our operations and highlight a few dynamics to consider for the balance of fiscal 2021. Our Moreno Valley distribution center continues to operate at a limited capacity, due to increased social distancing measures, taken as a precaution to maintain employee safety. Our Moreno Valley DC team and third-party logistics partners continued to work through the challenges associated with shipping higher levels of product sold through our e-commerce channel, in addition to the increasing volume of wholesale shipments, as we head into peak season. As a result of these conditions, we anticipate higher costs associated with employee safety and increased payroll costs related to DC employees. We continue to adjust our retail store fleet operations in compliance with updated and ever-changing health and safety standards. To provide some context for our retail store operations during the first quarter, approximately 20% of our stores were open for the entire 90-day period. The average store was open for roughly half the quarter. As of this week, approximately 95% of our global stores are open, but in most cases operating at a limited capacity. Given the ongoing and uncertain pandemic conditions, which include meaningful local and regional differences and restrictions imposed on retail store operations, we foresee potential risk of additional store closures or limitations during peak periods. Similar to our owned retail stores, many of our wholesale partner stores were closed for much of our first quarter, but have since reopened with limited operations. We have continued to work closely with our wholesale partners to identify areas of risk and make the relevant adjustments to our order book. Given the significant portion of business remaining in this fiscal year, as well as the uncertainty around economic conditions and consumer sentiments, we still anticipate cancellations to outweigh the orders. In terms of our sourcing, during the first quarter, we operated with reduced capacity due to the implementation of social distancing measures and we continue to experience travel restrictions between country borders and production facilities. However, these disruptions have been mitigated thus far and at this time, we are not experiencing any major sourcing disruptions. Given the first quarter is historically very different from our other three quarters in terms of channel and brand mix, and the first quarter was especially unique this year due to the marketplace conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that this will not be a typical year. I'd like to take a moment to recognize some of the dynamics we are observing and that should be considered for the balance of fiscal 2021. In the first quarter just completed, approximately 49% of revenue came from direct-to-consumer, heavily weighted towards e-commerce, which is significantly above last year and our typical quarter; 38% of revenue came from HOKA, which is well beyond last year and the average quarter and less than half of the revenue came from UGG, which typically represents over 70% of total company revenue on a full year basis. While we expect direct-to-consumer and HOKA revenue to increase as a proportion of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, we do not expect to repeat the levels of penetration experienced in this first quarter. Additionally, though we're optimistic about the UGG brand's start to fiscal 2021, the brand is a long way from its peak holiday time frame, which we are expecting to be highly competitive and feature increased level of promotional activity across the marketplace. Starting in the second quarter, wholesale is expected to become a more impactful portion of the UGG brand revenue, especially as we move some customer shipments forward to help alleviate potential pressure during the third quarter at our distribution centers. Given the number of unknowns, we continue to approach the UGG brand's peak season with appropriate caution. To summarize, our portfolio of brands delivered an excellent quarter and an exceptionally challenging environment. I'm proud of our teams for their dedication and discipline to achieve our best first quarter result of the past nine years. Despite the first quarter traditionally being our lowest revenue quarter, I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our brand and look forward to building on that momentum for the balance of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The ongoing pandemic will undoubtedly present adversity throughout the year, but I'm confident in our team's ability to manage the effects on our business. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Steve to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance and provide some additional color on our strategy to manage the balance of fiscal 2021. Thanks Steve. As I reflect on the quarter's performance, I remain encouraged by the power of our brands and their ability to capture consumer demand online. While myself and the management team are aware of the tough road ahead, we believe the foundation of our operating model provides our organization a unique opportunity to build market share as others are forced to take a more defensive approach. We plan to build on the first quarter success of our e-commerce and digital platform to accelerate gains in the channel, continue fueling the HOKA brand momentum, and build awareness through digital engagement with consumers, protect the marketplace management progress we've made in UGG by leaning into key styles and converting newly acquired customers to repeat purchases, and stay true to the Deckers organization values by innovating and developing creative solutions to challenging marketplace conditions. Our company brands and balance sheet are well-positioned to manage through this crisis. We will remain flexible to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisions in the best interest of our brands. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our longest tenured Board member, John M. Gibbons, as he plans to retire in the current quarter. I want to thank John for his 20 years of service on our Board of Directors. John's contributions including his time as our Chairman and his leadership of the Audit Committee have helped build the successful organization that we have today. John's leadership will be missed, and I'm thankful for his continued friendship. As we make this announcement, John asked me to express his gratitude for the trust and support of Deckers' stakeholders throughout his many years of service to the organization. We wish John the best in his retirement. Before I hand off to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to acknowledge the social movement happening across the United States over the past few months. The foundational belief of the Deckers organization is 'Better Together.' Our core values compel the organization to seek an active stance against racism, discrimination, and intolerance of any form. Deckers is an anti-racist organization, and we are actively taking steps to become better allies through continuous evaluation and improvement of internal practices, investments in education, and continuing to build a more inclusive workplace. Thank you to all of our employees for their exceptional efforts and commitment to our strategies. On behalf of Deckers, I hope everyone stays healthy and safe. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Good. Right. Yes. So Camilo, I'll take that one. I think as we look at what happened in Q1 and on the UGG business, we were down. And that was really driven largely by wholesale being closed for the good, good portion of the quarter. And so we saw things really kind of ramp back up in business in terms of what we were seeing. I think that's what led to delivering the quarter a little bit better than kind of where we were at, call it, mid-May. So we finished the second half of the quarter a little bit stronger. The reference that we're making in terms of the second quarter, which is typically a high wholesale selling quarter, the cadence of that quarter tends to be more back half Q2 loaded. So that's really when we see historically the wholesale accounts beginning to take their orders. We've been working with them to -- in light of the social distancing and capability issues that we're going to have at our DCs, to take things earlier. We're beginning to see some of that take hold. So in Q2, we're beginning to see some wholesalers give us signals they're taking product earlier. We expect that to kind of continue through the quarter. And that's where it changes the shape of the quarter a little bit. So we'll see how that -- kind of how that plays out. It is all part of our strategy of taking some of the pressure off the peak period that will allow us to be more focused on fulfillment of our DTC channel as well as potentially if we're able to get follow-up orders on wholesale. So still a work in progress, I think we've seen a strong start to the second quarter. We know this year looks different than last. And we're just trying to smooth that out, where historically again, we see a lot of pressure on the back half of the quarter. We're trying to smooth some of that out to the earlier part of the quarter. And then just also, Camilo, on that point aside from the market, and we indicated that a large portion of the savings in the quarter was related to travel. We'll be able to continue to save that in the current environment, but it will be offset, as we talked about in the prepared remarks with increased costs related to our fulfillment and DC costs. So you're going to see, as Dave said, increases in Q2, Q3 related to marketing as we invest in that and redeploy some of those Q1 dollars. We'll see higher costs related to fulfillment and distribution center costs. And we'll have some savings related to reduced travel. Yes, in line with business trends, but we do have the ability in certain areas to flex depending on the business trend. But the one thing we do need to make sure we spend is on DC to be able to deliver product to our customers and to our accounts. Yes. And just one other thing to be aware of it, lot of our partners sold through lot of inventory in their stores. So, folks that had omnichannel capabilities where they could ship from store. They depleted those store inventories. But since then, they've been slow to reopen those stores and some of them not opened at all yet. They haven't had to refill the inventory at a store level. They're maintaining, obviously their e-commerce business. But that's another dynamic that we're going to have to keep a close eye on as we move through the quarter. Yes. Sure, John. As we look at inventory, clearly we're pleased with an 8% kind of reduction coming from UGG, and that's really, as you said, kind of driven by the strong performance that we've seen online. So product resonating with consumers and selling through very well online. We have increases in HOKA as that brand continues to grow very rapidly. We want to make sure we have inventory to support the growing level of sales. So we've seen an increase in inventory related to the HOKA brand. With UGG, kind of in reference of where you're seeing some products in, this year, what we have done is intentionally shift more products to later. Last year, we were receiving products earlier. So from a timing perspective, we're going to see inventory coming in a little bit later this year versus last year. That's contributing to the improvement in lower inventory that we're seeing this year. So from an overall inventory position, we're comfortable with where we're at. We've got inventory to support the level of sales that we're delivering. And it's making sure we're bringing in where we see that pickup in sales. So that's been an area of focus. And in cases, we are bringing more inventory and to support the level of online sales that we've been seeing. So feel good about where we're at and we're continuing to manage it very closely. Yes. And related to that, John, just on that too, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're working with wholesale accounts. So to your point, yes, some would like to defer. But given the current environment that we're operating and limited capabilities that we potentially have at DCs, we are encouraging wholesalers to take that product earlier because it will be hard. If they try to push it off to our peak period and we're fulfilling direct-to-consumer sales at the same time, it's going to be hard to do that. So we're working with them. We're getting positive, I would say, response in terms of a willingness to actually take some product earlier this year. Yes, happy to. It's really interesting to see the shift in categories within the UGG band. And traditionally as you all know, we've been traditionally heavily reliant on the core franchise and obviously this time of year, the business is smaller and particularly driven by core. So we've seen a significant shift with the phenomenon of the Fluff franchise. I do think that UGG has somewhat created this slipper/sandal hybrid category that we're seeing tremendous success in. We're going to continue to drive that. We're chasing inventory in colors, there's an incredible amount of new product iterations and colors, continuing to drop throughout the quarter. We're expanding that into spring and summer next year. So that is a category that we're going to go after it aggressively and continue to dominate in that category. And what's great about it is, we're seeing a younger, more diverse consumer adopting that category, particularly online. So that's very encouraging. As you know, we've been working at spring and summer for some time now. We now have an ownable position in there that's resonating, particularly in the U.S. and starting to gain legs in international. The classics business is still important. What we have done with the back half of the year is reduced inventory in things like fashion boots. We're still expecting people to be working from home and going out less than -- more reliant on comfort at home. We do think that work for home we'll have a -- probably -- could have, I should say, a positive impact on the classics business. But people are more casual, and they just want to get outside. But we're continuing to manage the mix of categories and inventory and feel really good about the trends that you're starting to see within these new developing categories. As far as lifestyle, actually both HOKA and UGG did have good sell-through of their lifestyle product in this quarter, although, both are very, very small for us this time of the year. But we are encouraged by what we saw in HOKA with the catalog drop and the reaction to that and some of the products online. So there's a good sign of opportunity there for the HOKA brand. And then we have a significant -- our mostly significant launch, I would say, ever this fall for UGG with some new product that we think is going to be pretty exciting and compelling. And you'll see that in partnership with Nordstrom and select doors, in our flagship store that we'll be opening in the tail end of the calendar year on Fifth Avenue and certainly on our e-commerce site. So this year is only about test the waters, feel the kind of reaction we get from some of the new products in lifestyle for both HOKA and UGG, and then ramp up from there. But so far, we're optimistic about the potential and what we're seeing in the -- reacting to the consumer. You bet. Hi, Tom. Yes. So, I think, at this point, we're very pleased, obviously, with the results of HOKA. This quarter performed better than we expected back in May, when we were talking about it. The success of the HOKA ecosystem, which we call it, which is really about balancing strategic access points for our consumer with key accounts and staying focused on a reduced tight distribution at wholesale and then really leveraging that to create awareness and excitement, but ultimately driving consumers to our website that we can cultivate for the long term. We're going to continue on that trend. I think, what you see in the rest of the year is reflected in how we've talked about it, is just the uncertainty that we see out in the environment with regards to wholesale. I still think we can drive excitement and revenue in e-commerce. But on a global scale, the wholesale is still the area that we're still cautious about. The brand has also delayed a couple of the product launches and to make sure that we can execute and keep the marketplace clean due to some of the store closures and wholesale. That's serving us well. So we're still optimistic. We're still planning on having a growth year, but we're just being a little bit cautious with the uncertainty on how things are going to pan out in the back half of the year for that brand. But still certainly, a strong important brand for our wholesalers, those that can open stores and have an online business, but continuing to drive the e-commerce business as a priority. With regards to DICK'S, it's going very well. It's in about 11 stores right now. That's one we're taking slow cautious approach with. We want to focus on high sell-throughs, quality sales with that partner. And again, it's something where you can continue to evaluate, but it's off to a good start. DICK'S is happy, we're happy, and we'll evaluate that within the mix of the ecosystem going forward. You bet. Thanks, Tom. The wholesale -- you said the UGG brand... Non-UGG brands is what you're asking for? Yes, sure. So HOKA was up 10% on the wholesale. Teva on wholesale was down 30%, right. Sanuk was down wholesale 50%. And other brands was small, I mean, nothing, small dollars. Yes. Yes. So what we're kind of yes to all of the above. What we're doing is within the quarter, we're trying to move things earlier, right, which we're working on and seeing some progress on that front. Additionally, as we get into Q3, we're encouraging them to look at taking deliveries in Q2. That's still work in progress. We're continuing to work on that. And where we're seeing a willingness to take product earlier, we're working with them to help facilitate that. And it really kind of depends on the circumstances in the customers, but where we can get them to take it earlier, we're definitely willing to provide and work with them and accommodating that. Yes. So, again, looking at the quarter I think without giving guidance, just how we're looking at it because we don't yet know how much traction we're going to get in terms of how much of that product may shift out of Q3 into Q2. Ideally, what we would like to see is more product than say, what you saw a year ago, kind of coming into Q2, which would be then lower for that business Q3. So that October through December quarter, the more we could get moved into Q2, our September ending quarter, we would like to do. We don't know how successful we're going to be at that. Clearly, wholesale customers want their product. We would like them to get it and make sure that they have it and they're ready for the selling season. So, I can't answer that question. That's why we're -- part of the reason we're not giving guidance, but we are trying to move more of that Q3 wholesale into Q2where we can. Yes. So just a couple of things on that, Sam. I can't underscore enough the importance of us focusing our Q3 DC efforts on our e-commerce business, despite that we expect to get an e-commerce in a short period of time, the last call it, six to eight weeks of the calendar year is going to be intense. And with social distancing challenges in our DCs, we really needed as many wholesale out quarters out as soon as we can. So, we're hopeful that our partners will be supportive of that, and we're seeing some success there. But this is such a hard year to call with regards to timing and what's going to happen in the quarter. So, we're doing everything we can to make sure that that happens. But we're really trying to make sure that we're ready and able to service the e-commerce business in that peak period because it's so critical and a lot of handling on the individual orders. With regards to the Fluff franchise, I'd say we're in pretty good shape. We were bullish on this from an order perspective. We've been supporting this category, seeing inventory going to buys from our categories into this as well as I said, there's a lot of newness coming in drops that will help fuel the excitement in demand. So, we do feel good about our position on that. Certainly, the demand is very high, and that's super exciting and we see that continuing not just in Q2 and Q3, but also intoQ4 as well. Thanks Sam. Yes. Essentially, what we're seeing in Europe is a few things. One is we do have an emerging and strong e-commerce business there, but it's still small. And in comparison to the U.S., e-commerce internationally is something that we're focusing on and really trying to build. The growth percentages there are very strong, but it's still smaller as the total business. We did mention distributors in the script. We have a very strong distributor in the northern part of Europe, and they've been less affected by the COVID situation, so their orders are still strong and helping in the quarter. But the brand is certainly resonating. We launched the Clifton Edge this last month. Europe was very successful with that launch, and there was great demand for that product over there. But essentially what you're seeing, globally really not just Europe, is executing on a playbook that the brand has put together. And what that really is, is reaching a diverse consumer through real-life stories of our users. And so we're championing individual athletes who are making bold statements in the world and in their lives and using HOKA to improve and change their lives. And we're letting them tell their stories, and we're partnering with people who do that for us. And so that's creating a great level of awareness across a broad range of consumers and tapping into an emotional connection that is really powerful. And we've said from day one, we'll let the consumers speak about the product and let them talk about how it's affecting their lives and the performance of it. And that's the formula that is resonating. So we're continuing to do that with Humans of HOKA, storytelling and tapping into the virtual Ironman and some of our athletes, and leveraging even some of the smaller running groups on a local basis to use their content and their storytelling to really spread the word of the brand and create the authentic and meaningful connection with the consumer that we're seeing. You bet. Yes. I'll take the second one first. I think some of the challenges that we thought we would see, we didn't necessarily see it. And I think what we are seeing, we talked about this in the script is I would call it, there's an acceleration to the Fluff franchise and HOKA and also Teva from the work in home -- work-from-home environment where people either from UGG perspective want to be comfortable and are seeking out footwear that is comfortable, but still stylish. But also, they're trying to get outdoors and be healthy again, whether that's running or whether that's hiking or camping or going on family trips and national parks. This has been an accelerator, I think, for both HOKA and Teva at the same time as UGG. So that's a dynamic that we saw emerging, but it prove to be a lot more powerful than we thought. And so I definitely think we're benefiting from that. But certainly, if we didn't have the product that the brand's created and the innovation that we put into the marketplace along with the emotional connection in the marketing, we wouldn't be able to capitalize on that. So I think the brands have done a phenomenal job of taking advantage of the situation, being sensitive to the moment and connecting with consumers on an authentic and personal level, and driving the health of the brand. As far as HOKA inventory in the channel, early on the HOKA team did a great job of pushing out deliveries, so that the wholesale partners could sell-through existing inventories. They wouldn't get stuck with it. And they have been very focused on executing a clean marketplace, high full-price sell-through, very little liquidation in the marketplace. And that is continuing. And I would say, the wholesale inventory situation for HOKA, as well as our other brands as well are very strong, very healthy and not a lot of markdowns. But again, we're cautious going forward because we think the environment is still going to be very uncertain. But right now as it stands, the marketplace wholesale inventory is healthy and strong. Yes. We're -- the supply chain teams have been an exceptional job at managing not only the flow of product from a production standpoint, but also working with our partners and the sales teams on D.C. bypass. So the increase that we're seeing in D.C. bypass versus last year has been significant and meaningful, so that's been super helpful. Partners are willing in some cases have shown to be able to take some inventory earlier. And so those are the tactics that we're using. As far as incentivizing consumers to shop earlier, I think with new introductions of product, they're doing that. And I think when we get into kind of core classics business that is real business driver in Q2 and Q3, we can look at that, but we certainly don't want to get promotional or do incentives that are going to damage the brand or margins at the sake of getting people to shop earlier. But I think we'll get creative around it and just use the effective marketing and PR tools that we've developed to be able to drive excitement at the right times and try to get people to shop a little earlier. Yes. So from a unit perspective, I think where you're trying to go, Jim, is we're probably looking at equivalent units, right, that we have higher dollar revenue in the U.S. because of the distribution channels that we're using versus distributors internationally. We are seeing growth in both. So the international growth is coming on strong as units are catching up to what we're doing in the U.S. And then the second part of your question again was? Yes. So, Europe is definitely our strongest international region for HOKA. Japan, smaller market, doing very well and really just starting to get into China. So, Europe, by far, on the international front, biggest and most mature, but still growing very rapidly. Thanks, Jim."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just detailed, we are extremely pleased with the organization's performance amidst tough marketplace conditions. And as of June 30th, the organization maintained its strong liquidity position above $1 billion aided by the performance of our portfolio of brands that drove positive cash flow for the first quarter and is inclusive of untapped credit revolvers, totaling $470 million. Our strategic approach to managing through the pandemic and its economic impact served us well in the first quarter. We will stay the course and continue managing our business tightly by leaning on our strong operating model, while also fueling our brands to drive competitive gains in market share. Now for our results. First quarter revenue was $283 million, up 2% versus last year, and slightly above the trends we outlined for the first half of the quarter on our May earnings call. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by HOKA, which increased $29 million over the same period last year. Offsetting the HOKA brand growth was a $14 million decline in UGG, a $5 million decline in Sanuk, and a $3 million decline in Teva as compared to last year. Given the difficult marketplace dynamics during the first quarter, we were pleased to see our online channel's ability to capture consumer demand as physical store locations largely remain closed. In addition, our online results benefited from efforts to drive consumers to our compelling product offering in our historically smallest revenue quarter. Gross margins in the first quarter were up 330 basis points over last year to 50.3%. This result was aligned with our view of the business as a favorable shift in channel mix resulted from reduced wholesale volume, including a reduction of closeouts and an increased penetration of e-commerce. We also benefited from the HOKA brand's growth and its corresponding increased mix of total company revenue. Moving to SG&A. Our dollar spend was $150.3 million, down 7% from last year's spend of $161.4 million. The decrease versus last year was driven by variable category reductions with the bulk of the year-over-year savings attributed to reduced travel and shifting a portion of marketing spend to later in the year. The combined effect of these items represent approximately $10 million of reduced operating expense in the quarter. Income tax benefits were lower than last year due to a smaller net loss this year and a discrete tax charge in the current quarter with last year benefiting from a one-time tax refund. Our first quarter performance resulted in a loss per share of $0.28 as compared to last year's loss per share of $0.67. The $0.39 improvement versus last year was driven by higher revenue mix of HOKA including benefits from a greater portion of DTC sales, higher revenue and profitability from our domestic UGG business as DTC performance was able to offset declines in wholesale, variable expense savings primarily related to travel and marketing with partial offsets coming from lower UGG international wholesale revenue, year-over-year declines in Teva and Sanuk, no tax benefit this year, and reduced interest income compared to the same period last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. And as of June 30th, cash and equivalents were $662 million, up from $503 million at June 30th last year, and up from $649 million at March 31st of this year, making the first quarter net cash positive. Inventory was down 8% to $435 million as compared to $473 million last year. Inventory levels were down partially as a result of the intentional phasing of later receipts in order to more closely align with the timing of anticipated demand as we move into later quarters. And we had no material short-term borrowings under our existing credit lines, which have an available balance of $470 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter as we paused share repurchase activity, placing an emphasis on liquidity and cash management. Share repurchase activity remains paused for future periods, although we may commence future repurchase activity under our existing Board authorization as management deems appropriate. Finally, given the continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we will once again not be providing specific guidance for fiscal year 2021 at this time. However, I will reiterate the major themes of our business and briefly outline our management thinking. We continue to approach fiscal year 2021 with expectations that total company revenue will decline year-over-year, though we believe HOKA will still experience growth, albeit at a lower rate than the brand's 37% increase in the first quarter. The Fashion Lifestyle Group will face headwinds related to further international softness and additional wholesale cancellations. And as our wholesale business approaches our peak period and we begin shipping higher volumes of product, it will be increasingly difficult for our e-commerce business to compensate in the same proportion we saw in Q1 with the continued disruption of the retail landscape. Our gross margins, while we saw a meaningful improvement in the first quarter, we don't anticipate these channel and brand mix dynamics to continue for the balance of fiscal 2021 as the wholesale and distributor proportion of the business will increase. And we may also see promotional pressure in the marketplace as we move into the peak holiday timeframe. Expenses will continue to be managed tightly as we work to preserve liquidity, but we will use the success we are seeing to dial marketing up as appropriate to continue driving consumer engagement. And we will face higher costs related to distribution fulfillment as additional safety measures and higher labor costs will be incurred. So as we look at the remainder of the year, we recognize there will be continued challenges ahead resulting from the new realities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are managing through these challenges that include social distancing measures in place at our Moreno Valley and third-party logistics distribution centers. Our critical focus is on maintaining employee safety as we are addressing increasing demands on our fulfillment capabilities. This will ultimately result in the organization facing higher expenses to ship less product. To help mitigate some of the workload impacts related to these challenges, we are partnering with wholesalers to potentially ship some product earlier, which could result in the cadence of revenue looking different than previous years. Additionally, given the ongoing economic pressure, we do not yet know how our core product will sell in this environment. Consumer sentiment looms large as a tough variable to predict in this uncertain economic environment. With higher unemployment, uncertain government action and the potential for further shutdowns, we remain cautious in our approach to planning the UGG brand peak season. I'd also highlight that UGG is still facing brand heat challenges internationally, and our actions to reset the European marketplace will continue to be a drag on fiscal 2021 revenue. With the first quarter now behind us, we are encouraged with our performance and are still in a position to play offense with our healthy and in-demand brands, but will remain diligent and course correct where necessary. As we stated on our May earnings call, the strategic approach we have outlined to manage our business through this pandemic is expected to result in short-term pressure on operating margins, but we maintain belief that this strategy will best enable our brands to emerge in a position of strength as we move beyond the pandemic. Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes, Camilo, I'll take that one. So a few things just on marketing. The first thing that was really encouraging for us is we found that our demand -- the demand for our brands was very strong, particularly UGG and HOKA. And so we were able to actually pull back on some of the marketing spend as the demand for online business was already there. A couple of other things we did is we -- due to the social distancing, there was a lot of creative work that we would normally do in Q1 that we just weren't able to do in this environment. But we did shift a lot of the marketing dollars to top of funnel and more PR related and user-generated content. So I think the teams have done a phenomenal job being flexible and agile and really managing the efficiency and the effectiveness of our marketing spend. And I think that was demonstrated pretty solidly in Q1 with their ability to shift to be of the moment with the conversation that's going on amongst our consumers, to shift the marketing spend on a daily, sometimes hourly basis to maximize return. And then just be smart with where we're investing it, to make sure we're getting the spend and it's worth our time in Q1. And what we found is there were some opportunities to keep that powder dry for later in the year, particularly Q2 and Q3 with the strength and the demand of our brands during this environment. So we're going to continue to use that as a lever to adjust spend and profitability as we go forward. But as we've said before, we are going to continue to use this opportunity to invest in our brands and drive the power of those brands and growth with the goal of creating more awareness, consideration and acquisition and also taking share. I think that's a fair way to probably look at it. Yes. So I would say, Camilo, first, the demand for the brand still remains very strong. We have seen some cancellations as people are, kind of, getting back to business and seeing selling conditions. We indicated that we expected to see some and we have seen that. So no surprises. The brands are still strong. We have seen some cancellations, which we expected. Thanks, Camilo. Yes. And then just to add in on the whole sale shifting risk to us. I mean we are seeing a bigger demand and drop ship, and that's something we're evaluating closely from a cost and effectiveness perspective. And then wholesalers are also cautious. So they're making sure that they're only bringing in inventory if and when they need it. Certainly, UGG and HOKA and even Teva are strong brands in their portfolios, and there's still a lot of demand. But they are being more cautious overall in managing their inventory levels between stores and warehouse for e-commerce. Thanks Sam. Yes. And Paul, also just to add on to that, I think kind of what we're talking about too, keep in mind the significant increase in volumes that we're starting to talk about. So one difference between Q1and kind of later Q2 and Q3, we start getting into significantly higher volumes. And so that's where we want to make sure we're in a position to be able to fulfill. So when you hear us kind of all the things that we're trying to do is trying to mitigate some of that peak demand period and reducing the load on our DCs. Yes. That's our biggest challenge, for sure. And then the other thing to just keep in mind that's important for everybody to understand is this mix of this quarter versus the rest of the year. It's going to be very different. So it's not only a very different quarter, it's the whole year in the mix of business and how -- and the cadence and flow of it is going to be something that we haven't seen before. But we're feeling good about how we're able to manage through that. Thanks Paul."

I'm excited to share our record-breaking fiscal year 2022 results, which include a number of significant achievements. The first time Deckers delivered over $3 billion in annual revenue, and we did so just three years after reaching $2 billion. In total, we delivered fiscal 2022 revenue of $3.15 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year and nearly 50% above two years ago. Aligned with our commitment to driving top line growth and healthy profitability, Deckers delivered an operating margin just shy of 18%. And lastly, we delivered earnings per share of $16.26, which represents a 21% and 69% increase over last year and two years ago, respectively. As I reflect on this incredible expansion and evolution of our business over the past two years I look forward to seeing our brands build up this momentum, and I'm even more excited about the runway ahead. Of course, none of this will be possible without our dedicated employees and exceptional leadership team collaborating to deliver in a difficult supply chain environment while remaining focused on executing to the long term. Because of these efforts, our performance this year was well aligned with our long-term strategies to drive quality HOKA growth, further diversify and elevate the UGG brand, strengthen and build our DTC business and unlock the full potential of our international markets. More specifically, our progress in these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2022 includes: growing HOKA revenue by 56% over the prior year to nearly $900 million, which represents 28% of the total portfolio revenue, up from 22% last year and 17% two years ago, diversifying UGG revenue and highlighting the brand's success around the core with categories outside of women's classics now representing more than 65% of annual brand revenue, up more than 10 percentage points from five years ago, increasing DTC revenue by 14% versus the prior year and 65% versus two years ago; and expanding our international business, which grew 25% versus last year and 34% versus two years ago. Again, I'm proud of our organization for the hard work that enabled accomplishing these exceptional results while navigating an extremely complicated logistics environment. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we are operating from a position of strength and leveraging the lessons learned over the last 18 months. Deckers has incredible growth ahead, and I have the utmost confidence in the consumer demand for our brands and our team's proven ability to deliver on our goals, even amidst a complex macro environment. Steve will provide more details on our forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, I will share some details about fiscal 2022 brand and channel performance as well as some context around strategies propelling us forward in fiscal 2023. Starting with the brand highlights. Global fiscal 2022 revenue increased to 15% versus last year to $1.982 billion. This is the second consecutive year of driving double-digit growth. Success in fiscal 2022 was driven by continued consumer adoption of the Brands' diverse product assortment as all major categories increased double digits over the prior year, men's footwear grew to over $300 million after adding approximately $100 million over the last three years, apparel and accessories combined increased 47% over last year, now representing more than 6% of brand mix at more than $100 million and women's Classics continue to drive incremental dollar growth through newness. Consumers adopting a broader assortment of UGG products is directly related to the brand's ability to develop new franchises while innovating existing franchises. The Ultra Mini is a great example of the latter. First introduced in the second half of 2020 as a companion style related to the Brands' core Classic Media and Classic Short, the Ultra Mini has been viewed as something of a sneaker alternative with its greater year-round wearability as it supports a lower ankle height profile. While still very new to the ag assortment, the Ultra Mini has already become a top five DTC style among both newly acquired and retained consumers, and it was just outside of the top five styles among consumers aged 18 to 34 years old. The Tasman is another bugstyle that younger consumers are wearing as a sneaker alternative. The original Tasman has been around for many years now, but the out product team has developed this heritage style into a burgeoning franchise through the infusion of fresh colors, new prints and logo treatments, adding new lightweight and sustainable material options such as our UGG Plush blend of upcycle roll and plant-based lycocell for the Tasman LTA; the introduction of the TAS, a fashion leading platform version; and most recently, the launch of an innovative rain clog, the Tasman X. We are particularly excited about the initial response of the Tasman X, which was featured as part of a broader rain campaign during the fourth quarter and received positive coverage in a number of fashion publications, including a few organic consumer unboxing viral videos on TikTok. With its versatility, year-round relevance and broad consumer appeal, we believe the Tasman franchise can continue to be a key driver of further diversifying and de-seasonalizing the UGG brand. From an omnichannel marketplace management perspective, the UGG brand strategic priorities for the year played out as expected, with domestic wholesale driving impressive growth through a diverse product assortment while refilling the channel inventories, international regions growth rate exceeding the U.S. growth rate for the first time in four years and global direct-to-consumer increasing mid-single digits on top of the more than 30% increase from the prior year. These results are a testament to UGG omnichannel marketplace management as the brand was able to drive strong growth across all channels despite logistics challenges impacting the timing of deliveries and availability of products. This also speaks to the consumer demand for UGG overall, which remains quite high, as evidenced in the fourth quarter just completed. UGG outperformed well beyond our expectations in the fourth quarter as wholesalers accepted later-than-normal deliveries and DTC shoppers weighted beyond the peak holiday season for availability of key items that have been out of stock. Across the full fiscal year 2022, we saw a number of favorable indicators for UGG demand, including: U.S. search interest increasing 9% over last year and 20% over two years ago, according to Google Trends, 18- to 34-year olds remaining the UGG brand's largest age bracket of consumers, incremental purchases of multiple products at the same time, led by Tasman, Neumel and slipper combinations, highlighting our UGG-for-all mantra and an increase in the brand's loyalty program enrollment across every region with nearly 6 million global members at year-end. As the size and scale of the UGG rewards program continues to grow, I want to highlight a few key metrics that emphasize the value of these loyal consumers, such as that members account for approximately 40% or more of revenue in all regions where the program has existed for more than one year and that members spend approximately 40% to 50% more than nonloyalty consumers. Fiscal 2022 was another strong year for the UGG brand, and I'd like to thank the team for their hard work and dedication to delivering back-to-back years of exceptional growth. On the heels of the growth delivered over the last two years, we are placing an emphasis on maintaining the record levels of brand heat across global markets. To do this, we expect to elevate the brands through disciplined and strategic global marketplace management prioritize the consumer experience at DTC to build loyalty, edit to amplify the assortment, driving fewer but more powerful product stories and attracting new consumers through innovative fashion collaborations. I'm proud of the great work the UGG team has delivered and look forward to continued progress towards our strategic goals in the upcoming year. Moving on to HOKA. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 56% versus last year to $892 million, with improved supply, enabling the delivery of strong growth in the fourth quarter, HOKA drove yet another year of record-breaking results with plenty of exciting runway ahead. The HOKA team continues to build a balanced business across the brand an ecosystem of access points, which has enabled growth in every region across all channels. More specifically, from a channel perspective, for the full year, HOKA Global Wholesale accelerated, increasing 55% versus the prior year, with volume that is now larger than the brand's entire business in fiscal 2021 and global direct-to-consumer increased 58% versus last year with strong gains in acquired and retained consumers. With the rapid growth and consumer adoption of HOKA, distribution management remains a critical component of driving awareness with and attracting new consumers. On the wholesale front, I would note that the majority of growth in fiscal 2022 came from market share expansion with existing run specialty and outdoor retailers versus opening new points of distribution. While HOKA has opened new distribution with strategic partners and even expanded door counts with these accounts in certain instances, the brand continues to be highly disciplined about expansion. HOKA has a superb group of wholesale partners who have continued to support the brand's strategic vision, enhance the brand credibility and awareness with core consumers and help broaden the scope of consumers that HOKA reaches. Further to that point, I'd like to provide a little more context around the HOKA brand's growth opportunity at wholesale in the upcoming year and beyond, which includes core to our brand strategy, building market share and run specialty. While in certain locations, HOKA has grown to the number one or number two brand, we have identified several regional growth opportunities within pockets of the U.S. as well as overseas. Volume expansion with strategic partners that have opened in the last two years with the opportunity to increase door counts over time and opening a select number of doors with new strategic accounts. One of these new strategic relationships, I'd like to highlight is Foot Locker. HOKA and Foot Locker have shown mutual interest for several years now, and over that time, created a distribution plan that aligns the interest of both parties. We are excited to be opening HOKA in a limited number of Foot Locker doors beginning this summer, with the intent to increase the brand's exposure with the young consumers in key markets where HOKA is lacking presence with existing distribution. We know from our experience with UGG that the Foot Locker team has a clear perspective on their consumer and believe this valuable partnership can have a considerable impact on HOKA awareness with the 18- to 34-year-old audience. Complementing the HOKA wholesale business, the brand's direct-to-consumer channel has continued to acquire new consumers as well as drive repeat purchases with existing consumers. In fiscal 2022, HOKA global direct-to-consumer acquisition increased 50% versus the prior year, and retention increased 62% versus the prior year. While acquiring new consumers is an important metric as we expand HOKA awareness, increasing customer retention is a critical component of maintaining brand strength and building loyalty. Ultimately, DDC is where HOKA can best showcase the breadth and newness of the brand's innovative product assortment, including apparel, and provide a convenient consumer experience to drive repeat purchases. Over the last year, HOKA drove a more than 40% increase in the number of consumers making multiple purchases as well as those purchasing across multiple categories. Though wholesale remains the primary acquisition point for new consumers, the HOKA brand's digital marketing activations are also driving DDC acquisition with targeted consumers. The specific focus on the 18- to 34-year-old consumer the HOKA brand's digital tactics have been successful in growing the mix of these consumers by two percentage points over last year and six percentage points over two years ago. HOKA is also seeing a fantastic consumer response of the brand's pop-up retail locations. New York has been our strongest performer, but we're also excited about the recently opened pop-up store in Chicago and a relocation in Los Angeles, where we opened a store in Venice, California. We believe HOKA can deliver a premium experience at retail locations by showcasing the breadth of the brand's product offering and driving community engagement. Over the longer term, we see an opportunity to open a limited number of permanent locations in key cities around the world including our first U.S. location in New York City by the end of fiscal 2023. The HOKA brand's new strategic wholesale distribution, targeted digital marketing activations and pop-up retail stores in key markets are collectively designed to accelerate consumer acquisition around the world through increased awareness. Our integrated approach to managing HOKA distribution continues to serve the brand well in driving balanced global growth across the HOKA ecosystem of access points. On the product front, HOKA continues to develop an assortment designed to ignite the inter athlete within all humans. The brand's inclusive approach to product management includes evolving heritage franchises to be accessible to all types of athletes, elevating performance through new innovations and expanding the consumer audience through new categories. HOKA progress on all three of these strategies in fiscal '22 by introducing the Bondi X, which is both an evolution of the Heritage Bondi style and an elevation of performance with the addition of a propulsive carbon plate to the brand's most cushioned ride. Trail blazing with the all-new SpeakGoat 05, the lightest and most grippy version of the brand's number one trail shoe, reinventing the Mach using a lower profile outsold that delivers soft cushion with an uptempo ride built for speed and capable of being a everyday trainer, disrupting the height category with the AnaCappa franchise, which is a performance hunking shoe that features a sneaker like comfort and launching the all-new Kawana, which is designed to seamlessly transition from gym workouts to daily runs to casual wear. In all, HOKA continues to develop a compelling product assortment that is built with all types of athletes in mind, serving the spectrum of performance fronters to extreme hikers and trail explorers as well as those looking for everyday all-day comfort. I want to congratulate the HOKA team on delivering another phenomenal year of growth, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2023 through continued market share gains with existing wholesale partners, expanded awareness with new consumers that the brand launches its first major global marketing campaign later this summer, driving acquisition and replenishment activity through our direct-to-consumer channel and introducing innovative products with the brand signature HOKA Rod. Turning to Teva. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 17% versus last year to a record $163 million. Growth this year was driven by the brand's leadership in sports sandals and progress building share in closed-toe categories, highlighted by the success of the hurricane and the Rembert franchise. While wholesale drove the majority of growth for Teva in FY '22. The brand was able to comp the exceptional DTC growth experienced in the prior fiscal year. Success at DTC was driven by a significant increase in retained consumers, which the brand will look to replicate in the upcoming year. Shifting to Koolaburra. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 decreased 9% versus last year to $69 million due to the disruption of wholesale deliveries that resulted from pandemic-related bottlenecks. Despite this, the Koolaburra brand's D2C business increased 35% over last year and is now 3x the size of DTC volume two years ago. And finally, Sanuk Global revenue in fiscal year 2022 increased 3% to $43 million. We are pleased with the brand's performance driven by our greater mix of full-price business and an increase in higher price point items. With respect to channel performance in fiscal year 2022, both wholesale and DTC drove double-digit growth over the prior year, reflecting the strength of our omnichannel brand management. For the year, global wholesale revenue increased 31% over last year and 39% over two years ago with four out of five brands posting double-digit increases this year. Wholesale dollar growth was primarily driven by the momentum of global HOKA as the brand continues to gain market share, refilling the marketplace inventories for domestic UGG accounts and the A-brands international markets returning to growth, benefiting from the marketplace reset activities over the past few years that cleaned up distribution in EMEA and localized product and marketing strategies in China. Overall, wholesale revenue represented 61% of total revenue, which is up from 58% last year, but down from 65% two years ago. We expect to drive continued growth through wholesale, working with best-in-class partners who are showcasing our brands and attracting new consumers around the world. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, revenue for the year increased 14% over last year and 65% over two years ago to $1.2 billion. We experienced year-over-year gains in both physical retail as we lap closures during the prior year and online where we have focused our investments to drive new consumer acquisition and increase retention. Importantly, our DTC business is growing globally and across multiple brands as both domestic and international DDC increased double digits over last year, and four out of our five brands experienced growth on top of the exceptional increases achieved in the prior year with HOKA and OG accounting for the vast majority of dollar volume gains. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2023. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, our company's performance in fiscal year 2022 was outstanding as we drove top line growth above 20% and maintain top-tier operating margin in the high teens despite increased costs resulting from global supply chain disruption. Deckers has added just over $1 billion to revenue in two years, driven by the strength of demand for our brands, specifically HOKA, which has grown more than 50% for three consecutive years and UGG, which has increased double digits in back-to-back years. Our long-term strategies have continued to provide a strong foundation for driving profitable growth, and we are proud to maintain exceptional operating margin levels. We believe that with continued investment behind our key strategies, Deckers can drive profitable growth over the long term. We're excited about the year ahead, but first, let's get into our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $736 million, up 31% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by improved HOKA inventory availability that allowed the brand to deliver both record quarterly revenue of $283 million and full year revenue that was above the high end of our guidance range. Better-than-expected outperformance as we saw an extension of the holiday season with consumers willing to wait for delayed DTC shipments of product and high demand and fewer wholesale cancellations due to the continued strength of the UGG brand as accounts showed a preference to hold greater levels of key seasonal inventory as a hedge against future potential supply chain disruption that could occur in the upcoming year. And as a result, we expect this to impact UGG orders in this coming fall. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 48.7%, a 450 basis point decrease from the prior year period. The lower gross margin was primarily related to an approximate 490 basis point freight impact, primarily from increased air usage and higher ocean rates, unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced DTC and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates with partial offsets from HOKA margins benefiting from price increases and favorable brand mix. SG&A for the quarter was $277 million or 37.7% of revenue versus last year's $244 million or 43.5% of revenue. The increased spend was primarily related to higher headcount, marketing and performance-related compensation. These results, along with the lower tax rate and share count, resulted in diluted earnings per share, more than doubling last year's at $2.51. Our fourth quarter results underscore the exceptional performance demonstrated by our brands throughout fiscal year 2022, where Deckers eclipsed $3 billion of revenue for the first time. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue increased 24% versus last year to $3.15 billion. Our company added over $1 billion in top line revenue over the last two years, delivering a nearly 50% increase over fiscal year 2020. As compared to our guidance, revenue was $90 million above the high end, primarily due to outperformance in UGG. Revenue growth versus the prior year was driven by our two largest brands as UGG increased 15% and to $1.982 billion, with growth primarily driven by wholesale refill in the U.S. and a return to growth within the brand's international regions as we signaled at the outset of fiscal year 2022. And HOKA increased 56% to $892 million, with growth driven by all global regions and channels of distribution. Gross margins for the year were down 300 basis points versus last year to 51%. The decrease in gross margin was related to an approximate 370 basis point decrease from freight, primarily due to increased air usage and higher ocean container rates and unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced direct-to-consumer, with partial offsets from a greater mix of HOKA revenue, fewer closeouts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. For the full fiscal year, we incurred freight costs that were more than $100 million above the prior year, excluding the impact of higher volumes. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.043 billion, up 20% versus the prior year, $870 million. SG&A represented 33.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 34.2% in fiscal year 2021. Higher dollar spend was primarily related to increased marketing to build global awareness of the UGG and HOKA brands, increased compensation costs for added headcount to support our scaling organization and higher warehouse costs to support the growth of our brands. This resulted in a full year 2022 operating margin of 17.9%, which is at the high end of our original guidance range of between 17.5% and 18%. Despite the freight cost being well above what we anticipated at the outset of the year, we were able to deliver this operating margin result through disciplined management of variable expenses. For the year, our tax rate was 20%, which compares favorably to last year's 23.7%. Taxes were lower this year, primarily as a result of certain discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter and a higher proportion of international revenue. With these results, Deckers delivered another record diluted earnings per share of $16.26, which compares to $13.47 in fiscal year 2021. This result is more than $1 above the high end of our guidance range due to the strength of our fourth quarter. The $2.79 increase as compared to last year was primarily driven by: global UGG and HOKA revenue growth; net of increased marketing; a lower tax rate; a lower share count, reflecting the benefit of our most aggressive annual share repurchase to date; and favorable foreign currency exchange rates on net revenue, with partial offsets from higher freight costs from both airfreight utilization and climbing ocean rates, higher compensation costs with increased headcount, greater warehouse costs and variable expense growth in line with revenue growth. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2022, we ended the year with $844 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $507 million, up 82% from $278 million at the same point in time last year and up 63% versus two years ago, more closely aligned with the sales growth of 48% for the same period. And due to the significant increase of ocean freight rates in the second half of fiscal year 2022, this inventory includes approximately $50 million of embedded incremental ocean freight. And during the period, we had no short-term borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital above 35%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $90 million worth of shares at an average price of $292.51. For the entire fiscal year 2022, we repurchased over 1 million shares for approximately $357 million at an average price of $341.77. At March 31, 2022, the company still had $454 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before moving to our outlook for fiscal year 2023, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate any macro supply chain impacts on our business. Prolonged transit lead times, port bottlenecks related to trucking scarcity and ocean container shortages were the most material impacts to our business in fiscal year 2022, and we expect some of these pressures will continue as we begin fiscal year 2023. While I'm pleased to report that delays and part backlog have improved, we remain cautious given the scaling size of our business risks that current or future COVID outbreaks or other global events have a domino effect across the supply chain and the potential for port labor disruption to occur later this summer. As such, we continue to prioritize receiving inventory into the country of sale and thus, expect inventory balances to remain elevated during fiscal year 2023. Given the momentum of our brands and our strong balance sheet, we are comfortable carrying higher levels of inventory to ensure demand will be fulfilled. From a factory production standpoint, we have been successful in securing additional production lines with existing partners as well as onboarding new partners. We believe this will support our plan to continue fueling the growth of our brands and anticipate that this new production will allow us to begin to see expanded capabilities and capacities as we ramp into fiscal 2023 and beyond. On the cost front, we continue to see higher prices across the supply chain. But in some cases, we have seen some moderation. From an ocean freight perspective, we anticipate this to be a headwind to the first half gross margins as we lapped last year's first half lower cost. Additionally, we have been monitoring inflationary pressures on materials, but believe that impacts from ocean freight and materials inflation can be mitigated by the price increases we implemented for HOKA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and planned increases for UGG beginning in fall of 2022. Beyond that, we continue to anticipate using airfreight in fiscal 2023, but almost exclusively for the HOKA brand as we will work to fill production gaps caused by factory disruption. While we will experience savings from less air on the outside, we still anticipate using HOKA air freight during the year, which we do not intend to cover through pricing action. With all that in mind, we have taken concrete steps to mitigate the impacts on our business from persistent supply chain disruption, including placing orders and taking possession of inventory earlier for in-demand items, carrying greater levels of inventory on key styles during this disruptive period using airfreight to strategically position HOKA for the global market share gain and improving our supply chain logistics capabilities. While some of these strategies will increase costs and reduce certain efficiencies in the short term, we believe these decisions support driving profitable top line growth over the longer term. Shifting to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect year-over-year top line revenue growth of 10% to 11%, leading to revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, with HOKA growing in the mid- to high 30% range, reaching the $1.2 billion milestone on the low end; UGG growing low single digits, accounting for the wholesale revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that we anticipate will sell through during the upcoming fall season; and wholesale and DTC growth at a similar rate, reflecting the impact of strategic growth initiatives across all brands. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than last year. The increase over last year anticipates less air freight and benefits from select price increases within HOKA and UGG with headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates and continued impacts from higher ocean rates. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue. Higher spend is primarily related to: investments in talent and capabilities to scale the business and remain competitive in the marketplace, increased marketing to build global HOKA awareness and broaden the brand's consumer appeal and increased travel as markets open up. With these gross margins and SG&A expectations, we expect an operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which is similar to fiscal 2022 levels and approximately 150 to 200 basis points above pre-pandemic levels despite persistent cost pressures related to supply chain disruptions and aligns with our commitment to remain top tier among our peer group even as we continue investing behind long-term initiatives. We are projecting a tax rate of approximately 22% to 23%. All of this results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $17.40 to $18.25. The Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, which is elevated versus prior years as we scale infrastructure to align with our growing organization. Key areas of investment include: additional warehouse space, capital IT projects and refreshing certain existing retail stores as well as opening strategic new locations for HOKA and UGG. Our fiscal 2023 guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact for additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and geopolitical tensions. With continued uncertainty in the world and disruptions still impacting the supply chain, we will not be providing quarterly guidance. But similar to last year, we expect to drive full year growth and be profitable in all four quarters, but the quarterly cadence will likely be different than last year as we expect more pressure in the first half of the year compared to last. Some of the items driving quarterly differences year-over-year include: lower gross margins expected in the first half of the year as compared to last year due to higher ocean freight expense, planned increases to marketing investments in the first half to support HOKA launching its first major global campaign alongside new product introductions and higher talent costs related to investing in our workforce and adding headcount. With these impacts and a strengthening U.S. dollar, we expect lower profitability in the first quarter as compared to last year. Thanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2022 represented another phenomenal year for Deckers as our portfolio of brands delivered revenue and earnings growth above 20%. We continue to drive progress towards our long-term vision to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through its strategic investments. These strategies continue to benefit our organization's focus and act as a North Star guiding to continued development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability. Our consistent delivery of exceptional results often overshadows the progress our organization continues to make in doing good and doing great in the communities where we operate. We've made great progress with Deckers Gives, as our employees contributed more than 14,000 volunteer hours in fiscal year 2022; our DAI initiatives as we've improved bipart representation among our leadership teams to 21%, which is up from 12% two years ago. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work that continues to drive Deckers into the future. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. Before I turn over the call, I'd like to acknowledge our announcement earlier that Wendy Yang will be stepping down from her role as President of Performance Lifestyle effective as of the end of this month. On behalf of the entire Deckers team, I want to thank Wendy for her leadership and contributions over the past seven years. With HOKA and Teva in their strongest position to date, I am confident in our ability to continue our positive momentum. I look forward to the future with this talented team and wish Wendy the best. While the company conducts a leadership search, Stefano Caroti, our President of Omnichannel, will assume Wendy's responsibility on an interim basis. Wendy will remain with the company in a consulting role through August 15, 2022, to ensure a smooth transition. As we are now ready to take questions, again, I would like to say how proud I am of the Deckers organization and our accomplishments over the past few years. We have delivered impressive results and have built a strong foundation for the future. Our future opportunities are more exciting than ever, and I look forward to the journey ahead with our team. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. And congrats on such a great finish to the year. Dave, Steve, I wanted to ask about pricing. When we think about the 10% to 11% growth for the year, we're hearing a lot of brands take up pricing. Should we assume that there's high single-digit pricing for this year? Any guardrails on that would be very helpful.\nDavid Powers: Yes, great question. Generally speaking, I would say the best way to think about it is across the board, across all brands globally, there's about a 6% to 8% increase in prices heading into this year. And it's been surgical by brand, by style, by region, but we think that that's right for the brand. It gives us upside to offset some of the headwinds in margin from freight charges and is in line with expectations in the market and still competitive. And we're going to continue to evaluate that and look for opportunities, as we always do. But across the board, it's generally around 6% to 8%.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. And then my follow-up question is with regards to HOKA's growth of high 30s, can you give us any update on how many doors you're currently at DICK'S Sporting Goods? When you said limited number of doors at Foot Locker, can you just give us some guardrails? And on that, like how do we think about wholesale versus direct-to-consumer growth? I think you mentioned right wholesale still be the driver, but just trying to put some guardrails around that after the full year's results.\nDavid Powers: Yes. I would say consistent with the way the HOKA brand has been managed to date, very strategic and very thoughtful on how fast we go and which accounts we grow with. DICK's Sporting Goods, the business there is very, very strong. but we're still in less than 20% of the total doors and not really looking to expand that aggressively anytime soon. And as you heard in the script, we also have this open Foot locker in a handful of stores. as well. So early days, but we want to -- as we said all along, we want to win with sell-through. We want to be in the right locations with the right partners for our consumers and build a quality sustainable business over time. So we are looking to expand wholesale, but it's really more in the accounts we're already in. We still see a lot of upside in the run specialty channel, even though in some cases, we may be the number one running brand and have 20% market share in that channel. There's still a lot of upside there globally. And then the key partners that we've talked about with REI, DICK'S and now Foot Locker, we're going to grow strategically with them in a way that builds a strong sustainable business and targets the right consumers over time. So -- and then DTC is obviously the main focus in. The pop-up stores that we've done with HOKA, we're very excited about those. We see an opportunity for those locations to grow around the globe strategically as well as we look at our marketplace strategy to augment the awareness that we're building in wholesale, but to create a really powerful experience for our consumers and get them to understand the full breadth and the excitement of this brand. So lots of reasons to be excited. We have opportunities in wholesale, e-commerce and retail, and we're going to look holistically across the three of those channels to decide going forward, what's the best way to build this brand in a sustainable and strong way going forward. But I will say we're very proud of the productivity of the doors we're in globally. I think that's a true testament to the strength of the brand, where yes, we're selling in, but the strength of our sell-through is what's really exciting for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Good afternoon. Thank you. I want to maybe ask first on the UGG brand. Just thinking about the low single-digit guidance for the year, can you maybe just quantify the wholesale timing impact that you called out? And whether or not you'd be sort of mid-single-digit underlying? And then when you think of the building blocks for that, could you maybe just share more color given the commentary you had on sort of the brand diversification and strengthening international, what you're seeing to give you confidence in that underlying growth?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, sure, John. This is Steve. I'll go first. So on the UGG, you're right. When you consider what we did in the fourth quarter, again, demonstration of how strong the brand performed, how relevant the brand was. We also did see strategic partners, wholesale accounts who took inventory in knowing that they weren't going to sell it through in the fourth quarter. So as we expect, they'll carry it in knowing that there are supply chain disruptions they're happy to carry it into our fiscal year '23, which we expected to sell through. We do see that more as an impact in kind of Q3, Q4. And you're right, so the underlying growth on that is more mid-single digits versus the low single digits that we were kind of thinking previously.\nDavid Powers: Yes. And there's still a lot to be excited about, UGG. I mean, double-digit growth two years in a row in this environment and some of the supply chain challenges we've had, there's still a lot of upside, but we are taking a little bit more of a cautious approach in the shorter term to kind of make sure that we're resetting appropriately coming out of COVID. But when you look at the UGG brand, I mean, we're attracting a younger and more fashionable and diversified consumer. There is still growth in women's footwear, both in classics and extensions in some of the fashions, particularly in spring and summer. Men's, kids and apparel, those all have double-digit growth opportunities into this year and beyond. We're excited about the reset and the positive results in Europe and Asia. We've got some new leadership in the team in marketing and product management, and we'll be bringing on a new leader soon, ramping up the innovation pipeline. There's just a lot to be excited about, but we want to do this strategically thoughtfully and in partnership with our commercial leaders in the regions to really attack the marketplace in an elevated and consistent manner.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, that's really helpful. And then maybe a broader question on your total top line growth profile. I know before COVID, you talked about several years where you saw, I think it was low double-digit combined revenue growth. Any thoughts as you look out beyond this year. Is that sort of the right algorithm, especially after this year when pricing falls off a bit and then tied into that, is this sort of a 1-year step up in the G&A investment? And what do you expect to get leverage after this year?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Thanks, John. And I think that's a good way to look at it now. Again, we're in a year of a lot of uncertainties, so a lot to work through. But I think we're thinking along those lines. And so yes, this is a year of investment coming on the heels of two years of significant top line growth, kind of we'll work through this year. But I think generally, how you said it is kind of a good way to think about it, and then we'll see how this year progresses.\nDavid Powers: Yes. And there is a lot of investments still to make in the business, too, I mean you think about the international growth, setting up retail footprint to expand into HOKA and elevate our game in UGG apparel resources, IT resources, et cetera. And we've made some investments this year. We're going to continue to do that in line with the growth of the business. So hopefully, the supply chain headwinds, the cost side of that subsides over the next year or two and we can reinvest some of those savings back into the business, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMackenzie Boydston: Hi, this is Mackenzie Boydston on for Camilo. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just more generally, how your wholesale partners are viewing back half orders and if their views have changed at all from, say, 90 days ago, just any thoughts on discussions with your partners would be really helpful.\nDavid Powers: Yes. I mean, the partnerships are still very healthy. We work really hard on these relationships with our key partners, and I think that served us well over the last couple of years with supply chain disruptions and lack of availability or visibility on inventory. I think it's an ongoing challenge, but I'm proud of the way our teams are managing through it. And we haven't heard any real major issues from any of our wholesale partners. Obviously, they want as much product they can get as fast as they can. So that's really what the conversations are about. It's more about how can we get it versus, hey, we want to do cancellations. We're not seeing any of that at all.\nSteve Fasching: Yes.\nMackenzie Boydston: Perfect. That's helpful. And then just on gross margin. I think it compressed a little bit more than we were modeling. So just understanding maybe the puts and takes to gross margin this quarter? And then maybe is it safe to say that Q4 is maybe the trough for gross margin contraction, knowing that it will still be challenged in the first half, but just trying to understand how it how next year gross margins kind of set all versus this year?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So I think on that, Mackenzie, that on the Q4 hit, you're right, a little bit more, and that was really driven by freight. And that -- and within the freight, there was the ocean combination, but there was also more air freight as we used air to bring in the HOKA product, which really helped drive the top line on the HOKA sales for the quarter. So that was an important element to be able to get that product in. As we said going forward, our expectation is we will incur some headwinds with ocean freight in the first half of the year as we're lapping a year that didn't have that freight, and then we do expect to reduce our air freight usage. So sitting on a better inventory position this year going into FY '23, our expectation is that we'll need to use less air freight, which should help margins this year versus last year.\nDavid Powers: Yes. And the other thing I would add just on a little color on HOKA. We're still in a chase mode on demand is still exceeding supply, but our supply teams have done an incredible job finding more capacity for us in Vietnam and beyond for the HOKA brand. And we're going to see the effects of that start to kick in probably in the second half of this fiscal year. which should help us finally get us to the point where we're cut up to the demand. But we're still in chase mode right now, which is great, but we're missing some opportunities because of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Dave, you mentioned Europe and HOKA retail, I want to maybe see if we can dive into those topics a little bit. Specifically on UGG, you've been working really hard, the company has been working really hard on resetting that business. It seems like it's poised to break out this year. And -- but the question is, do you see some of the macro factors disrupting that? And secondly, on HOKA retail, so what's your vision here? It sounds relatively new. What kind of -- just give us sense what kind of store format you see? What the potential is? And what the what the objective is there with HOKA retail?\nDavid Powers: Yes. Great question. Really excited about Marco, the GM of Europe and the progress that he and the team have made around UGG. It has been a multiyear journey. They've done a great job of cleaning up the marketplace and creating a city around classics, introducing styles like the Fluff and that franchise to her consumers. So the playbook, so to speak, that we've been employing in the U.S. is working. It's unfortunate that we've had supply chain challenges last year, and now we have a macroeconomic challenge going on in that region. We're still optimistic. We're still hearing positive responses from our accounts and the fact that there's still leaving an egg and want the inventory, we can get it. But it is going to dampen our opportunities a little bit, and that's embedded into the guidance. But suffice to say, the brand is on a resurgence there. We have work to do in individual markets that was looking to really optimize Germany as an example. We were in the market in December visiting the market. The brand is strong. But we need to raise our game on how we look in front of the consumer and how we show up in DTC a little bit. But the good news is a lot of the trends that we're seeing in the U.S. around a younger consumer gravitating to the brand, we're seeing that there as well. And we think that we have a really strong run for the UGG brand going forward. With regards to HOKA retail, it's definitely early days. we got into retail really is a way to attack the China market. So we opened our first few stores in the China region. We opened pop up here in New York and L.A. and we just opened one in Chicago, all exceeding expectations, all doing great. They're smaller formats by design, but they're giving us great confidence that we can do some meaningful business through retail for HOKA, but the real objective is to just engage with our consumers and create further our ecosystem. So we're driving them into our brands across multiple categories, bringing them online, maximizing lifetime value. So we're not looking at this says, \"Hey, we want 200 HOKA stores overnight.\" But they will play a strategic role in bringing the full breadth of the brand to consumers in key cities that we have identified, and then we're going to maximize the opportunity in some of these key cities and then see where we go from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a phenomenal year.\nDavid Powers: Thank you.\nJohn Kernan: So maybe just step back on the gross margin, for everyone across the whole sector, across the risen here, whether it's raw materials, ocean, air, on the freight side, just wondering how the long-term gross margin outlook? Has it changed at all if some of these costs remain structurally higher on the commodity and transportation and freight side? How do we think about this new inflationary environment that we're in?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I think it's -- this is Steve, John. It's a big question, and I think no one knows for certain how all this plays out. I think and expect is we should see improvement, but I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon, right? And that's really what we've modeled in. So on that, from a gross margin perspective, we're assuming ocean freight does not significantly improve this year versus last. Although last year in the first half, we were not expensing through the inventory at these higher levels of inventory. So FY '23 will be a full year of expensing that higher ocean rate. We're using pricing to offset most of that. So we're able to pick up a little bit through some of the pricing increases. We're not using, as we said in the prepared remarks, using price increases to offset the air. So as we move in and supply chain disruption improves, margins should improve as we reduce our air freight usage. And as we said, again, we're planning to use less airfreight this year than what we used last year. So I think that's kind of one dynamic. Then on inflation, we haven't yet seen too much of that impact, although we know it's coming, right? So we've been anticipating disruption, some inflation. That's why we're bringing more inventory in earlier. That's why you're seeing our inventory sit a little bit higher than where it has been in historic levels. But as we call out on a multiyear comparison, our inventory growth is still in line with sales growth. So that's something that we'll keep an eye on. We're able to benefit a little of that through materials inflation by having the inventory now. But it is something that we're going to keep a close eye on because that is something that we expect could present itself as a headwind. And again, we'll look at pricing structure then. So to answer your question, I think it's too early to know long term how all this plays out. We think the guidance, as best we know today, factors most of this in. And then hopefully, we start to see some improvement longer term, but our expectation isn't that you're going to see anything improve much in our current fiscal year '23.\nDavid Powers: Yes.\nJohn Kernan: I guess maybe one follow-up is, you talked about HOKA becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. I think there's a lot of people that believe in that potential. Can you talk to what it looks like from a channel perspective as you start to get there? Wholesale, it feels like there's more opportunity on the wholesale side. You talked to the DTC piece already. How do we think about wholesale and DTC as HOKA scales to multi-billion dollars in revenue?\nDavid Powers: Yes. I think there's -- well, there's two things to think about. One is the category opportunity. So we really see HOKA as a performance brand and a performance brand across multiple categories. We're obviously rooted in running, and that's where our authenticity comes from, but we're relevant and important trail and hike and getting into fitness and other categories down the road, head to toe. So when you think about the breadth and the shoulders that this brand has, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity. From a channel perspective, listen, we could light up wholesale today and dramatically increase the results of this business overnight. But we want to make sure it's sustainable. And in this environment where first-party data is critical for success. We're doing everything we can to drive healthy DTC business at the same time. So right now, we're looking at probably a 50-50 split because internationally, there's there is more opportunities in wholesale, and that's just depending on the market than DTC today. But we're very conscious of the fact that we're leveraging wholesale to introduce the brand and create awareness and have healthy sell-through in the right accounts. But at the end of the day, we want that traffic to all to end up in our website and in our stores. And we believe that that's the right model. We have the resources. We have the capabilities to make that happen. And we're in this for the long haul. We want to see this to be a multibillion-dollar brand that is meaningful against some of the top performance brands in the world over time.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And I think also, John, on that, as we've said before, brand awareness of HOKA, relatively speaking, is still low.\nDavid Powers: Yes, low.\nSteve Fasching: And so we can strategically use these wholesale accounts to build that brand awareness. And then we do see a high conversion rate down the road where they come to us direct. So this is -- it's a great way to build brand awareness, using these relationships in a strategic partnership to really get the brand out there in front of consumers. Yes. And one other opportunity that we've talked about within the UGG brand is the loyalty program. We have now almost 6 million consumers, I believe, in our loyalty program. Those are our best consumers. They shop most frequently to spend more money than somebody who's not in loyalty program. And this is an emerging opportunity for HOKA as well down the road that we can use to kind of further bolster the strength of our DTC channel.\nJohn Kernan: Awesome. Congrats on a great year and outperforming most of your peers in the industry.\nDavid Powers: Thanks, John.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks guys. The EBIT margin guidance that you gave for the year is similar to what you achieved this past year. I'm curious how you're thinking about each brand and where you expect HOKA versus UGG to shake out versus this prior year? Or if you're looking at both of them as being kind of in line? And then second question, I'm just curious, just from a very high level, which parts of your supply chain right now are getting better, saying the same, getting worse? Any comments along the -- along those lines.\nDavid Powers: Sure, Paul, I'll go first. Just speaking about kind of the gross margin guidance that we've provided similar to what we had in '22. So as we talked about, some improvements on the gross margin, but then also some investment. So as we've always said, we have shifted our operating model to be more variable. So that gives us flexibility in terms of when we see some headwinds to how we can potentially offset some of those headwinds, which is exactly what we did in FY '22 to deliver at the high end of what we gave a year ago. So what we also know is that we tightened our belt. And so going into a year where we can get some -- a little bit of gross margin improvement, it gives us an opportunity to also make some investments in the business. And what we've said and you've heard me say it before, is we are looking at the long-term opportunities for our brand. And so we want to make sure that we're providing the right level of investment. And even with these results, as we say, these are among the best in our peer group. So we're flexible, we're nimble. We've got a nice variable model that allows us to do that. And so we'll take these opportunities then when we can expand a little bit of margin to also make sure we're investing in the business for the long term.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And then, Paul, to answer your questions on supply chain, so just going down the list, I would say our capacity is good, right? We have the factory capacities that we need for all the brands, but particularly HOKA increasing going into the second half of the year. So that's good. Shipping times are still a challenge, right? We've had to put buffers into our lead times for product creation and then when we put our buys in. So there's a level of uncertainty that comes with that, but we're managing that through that well, but it is from the time inventory leaves the factory to our DCs is still longer than we would like, obviously. Port bottlenecks, and particularly in Long Beach, we're seeing a little bit of improvement there. Things are coming in a little bit faster. But I hope I'm wrong, but I personally think there's just a lull before we come into the fall inventory starting to ramp up again. So I'm optimistic that, that will continue, but I'm a little nervous that when we get into peak selling season, that's going to jump up again. Inventory and visibility of that inventory and timing as to when it's going to come in, still a challenge for our teams, their customer experience and the sales team are having to rebalance orders against inventory availability. So that's just a lot of heavy lifting that the teams have to go through. We don't see a lot of improvement on that yet still because the challenge with the port is we don't know which container is going to come in and win. But -- and then on the logistics side of it from a DC perspective, the investments we've made in the last couple of years are paying off. We have a little bit of work to do and just stabilizing some of the newer DCs in Europe and the Midwest, but we're excited that we have these underway and we're gearing up for continued growth. So I think the hope there is that the shipping lead times and the bottlenecks of the port by it a little bit. And I think other than that, we're really in good shape.\nDavid Powers: And then I think just also to add, we are keeping a close eye on the labor contract negotiations with West Coast port workers. So that's just something else that we're very carefully watching. And again, why we're bringing in inventory earlier than what we normally do. So something just to keep a close eye on.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And I do think, and I really believe that bringing this inventory orally and carrying a little bit is going to serve us well because we need the inventory in the marketplace to be able to sell it. And it's a very uncertain environment right now, still probably more uncertain than it was a year and even last year ago -- two years ago. So I'm excited that we have this inventory coming in. We're in good place. We just need to get it out to the marketplace now and just keep going after it.\nPaul Lejuez: Just a quick follow-up on the inventory. Can you just say what entry increases by brand?\nDavid Powers: Yes, we didn't provide that. What we can say is it's consistent with -- the larger brands is consistent with the average. So increasing as we anticipate kind of disruption and bringing more in. But again, on a two and three year comparison to sales is in line with our sales growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Nikic with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, just -- I think earlier you were talking about still being in chase mode for HOKA and expecting inventory availability to be better in the back half of the year. So as we kind of model the year, should we think that the growth is a little bit stronger for HOKA in the second half of the year? Or am I kind of off base here?\nDavid Powers: Yes. I was referring more to Q4 results, we were chasing. That's why we saw the -- we got the inventory and we aired it in, and that got into the marketplace, and we're still getting some of that inventory out to the marketplace. Right now, the teams are still out selling for next spring. So it's -- we're waiting to see what that looks like. But the point I was trying to make is that if the sales increases -- if the sales orders increase, we have the capacity to meet them. But right now, I wouldn't necessarily say that Q2 is going to be that much stronger than Q1. It's early days on that. But we think pegging ourselves a 30% to 35% growth for the year is right. There's potential that could be higher than that. But early in the year in an uncertain environment, we think this is the right way to place the guidance.\nTom Nikic: Understood. And Steve, if I can ask you a quick one, just I think the stock is much lower than it had been, and you've got quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet, and I know that you're investing this year and you said something about like elevated inventory. But like how do we think about buyback and your willingness to sort of maybe get a little bit more aggressive on the buyback in light of the valuation where it is today?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. A good question. And as you know, we don't necessarily comment on current activity. But I can speak to the year we just completed. And as I said, it's the most aggressive share repurchase that we've ever done at prices higher than where we currently sit. So clearly, this is something that we're watching very closely, active discussion on. But yes, we recognize where our price is at and where the company is going. So that is something that we take into account.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference for today. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to share our record-breaking fiscal year 2022 results, which include a number of significant achievements. The first time Deckers delivered over $3 billion in annual revenue, and we did so just three years after reaching $2 billion. In total, we delivered fiscal 2022 revenue of $3.15 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year and nearly 50% above two years ago. Aligned with our commitment to driving top line growth and healthy profitability, Deckers delivered an operating margin just shy of 18%. And lastly, we delivered earnings per share of $16.26, which represents a 21% and 69% increase over last year and two years ago, respectively. As I reflect on this incredible expansion and evolution of our business over the past two years I look forward to seeing our brands build up this momentum, and I'm even more excited about the runway ahead. Of course, none of this will be possible without our dedicated employees and exceptional leadership team collaborating to deliver in a difficult supply chain environment while remaining focused on executing to the long term. Because of these efforts, our performance this year was well aligned with our long-term strategies to drive quality HOKA growth, further diversify and elevate the UGG brand, strengthen and build our DTC business and unlock the full potential of our international markets. More specifically, our progress in these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2022 includes: growing HOKA revenue by 56% over the prior year to nearly $900 million, which represents 28% of the total portfolio revenue, up from 22% last year and 17% two years ago, diversifying UGG revenue and highlighting the brand's success around the core with categories outside of women's classics now representing more than 65% of annual brand revenue, up more than 10 percentage points from five years ago, increasing DTC revenue by 14% versus the prior year and 65% versus two years ago; and expanding our international business, which grew 25% versus last year and 34% versus two years ago. Again, I'm proud of our organization for the hard work that enabled accomplishing these exceptional results while navigating an extremely complicated logistics environment. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we are operating from a position of strength and leveraging the lessons learned over the last 18 months. Deckers has incredible growth ahead, and I have the utmost confidence in the consumer demand for our brands and our team's proven ability to deliver on our goals, even amidst a complex macro environment. Steve will provide more details on our forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, I will share some details about fiscal 2022 brand and channel performance as well as some context around strategies propelling us forward in fiscal 2023. Starting with the brand highlights. Global fiscal 2022 revenue increased to 15% versus last year to $1.982 billion. This is the second consecutive year of driving double-digit growth. Success in fiscal 2022 was driven by continued consumer adoption of the Brands' diverse product assortment as all major categories increased double digits over the prior year, men's footwear grew to over $300 million after adding approximately $100 million over the last three years, apparel and accessories combined increased 47% over last year, now representing more than 6% of brand mix at more than $100 million and women's Classics continue to drive incremental dollar growth through newness. Consumers adopting a broader assortment of UGG products is directly related to the brand's ability to develop new franchises while innovating existing franchises. The Ultra Mini is a great example of the latter. First introduced in the second half of 2020 as a companion style related to the Brands' core Classic Media and Classic Short, the Ultra Mini has been viewed as something of a sneaker alternative with its greater year-round wearability as it supports a lower ankle height profile. While still very new to the ag assortment, the Ultra Mini has already become a top five DTC style among both newly acquired and retained consumers, and it was just outside of the top five styles among consumers aged 18 to 34 years old. The Tasman is another bugstyle that younger consumers are wearing as a sneaker alternative. The original Tasman has been around for many years now, but the out product team has developed this heritage style into a burgeoning franchise through the infusion of fresh colors, new prints and logo treatments, adding new lightweight and sustainable material options such as our UGG Plush blend of upcycle roll and plant-based lycocell for the Tasman LTA; the introduction of the TAS, a fashion leading platform version; and most recently, the launch of an innovative rain clog, the Tasman X. We are particularly excited about the initial response of the Tasman X, which was featured as part of a broader rain campaign during the fourth quarter and received positive coverage in a number of fashion publications, including a few organic consumer unboxing viral videos on TikTok. With its versatility, year-round relevance and broad consumer appeal, we believe the Tasman franchise can continue to be a key driver of further diversifying and de-seasonalizing the UGG brand. From an omnichannel marketplace management perspective, the UGG brand strategic priorities for the year played out as expected, with domestic wholesale driving impressive growth through a diverse product assortment while refilling the channel inventories, international regions growth rate exceeding the U.S. growth rate for the first time in four years and global direct-to-consumer increasing mid-single digits on top of the more than 30% increase from the prior year. These results are a testament to UGG omnichannel marketplace management as the brand was able to drive strong growth across all channels despite logistics challenges impacting the timing of deliveries and availability of products. This also speaks to the consumer demand for UGG overall, which remains quite high, as evidenced in the fourth quarter just completed. UGG outperformed well beyond our expectations in the fourth quarter as wholesalers accepted later-than-normal deliveries and DTC shoppers weighted beyond the peak holiday season for availability of key items that have been out of stock. Across the full fiscal year 2022, we saw a number of favorable indicators for UGG demand, including: U.S. search interest increasing 9% over last year and 20% over two years ago, according to Google Trends, 18- to 34-year olds remaining the UGG brand's largest age bracket of consumers, incremental purchases of multiple products at the same time, led by Tasman, Neumel and slipper combinations, highlighting our UGG-for-all mantra and an increase in the brand's loyalty program enrollment across every region with nearly 6 million global members at year-end. As the size and scale of the UGG rewards program continues to grow, I want to highlight a few key metrics that emphasize the value of these loyal consumers, such as that members account for approximately 40% or more of revenue in all regions where the program has existed for more than one year and that members spend approximately 40% to 50% more than nonloyalty consumers. Fiscal 2022 was another strong year for the UGG brand, and I'd like to thank the team for their hard work and dedication to delivering back-to-back years of exceptional growth. On the heels of the growth delivered over the last two years, we are placing an emphasis on maintaining the record levels of brand heat across global markets. To do this, we expect to elevate the brands through disciplined and strategic global marketplace management prioritize the consumer experience at DTC to build loyalty, edit to amplify the assortment, driving fewer but more powerful product stories and attracting new consumers through innovative fashion collaborations. I'm proud of the great work the UGG team has delivered and look forward to continued progress towards our strategic goals in the upcoming year. Moving on to HOKA. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 56% versus last year to $892 million, with improved supply, enabling the delivery of strong growth in the fourth quarter, HOKA drove yet another year of record-breaking results with plenty of exciting runway ahead. The HOKA team continues to build a balanced business across the brand an ecosystem of access points, which has enabled growth in every region across all channels. More specifically, from a channel perspective, for the full year, HOKA Global Wholesale accelerated, increasing 55% versus the prior year, with volume that is now larger than the brand's entire business in fiscal 2021 and global direct-to-consumer increased 58% versus last year with strong gains in acquired and retained consumers. With the rapid growth and consumer adoption of HOKA, distribution management remains a critical component of driving awareness with and attracting new consumers. On the wholesale front, I would note that the majority of growth in fiscal 2022 came from market share expansion with existing run specialty and outdoor retailers versus opening new points of distribution. While HOKA has opened new distribution with strategic partners and even expanded door counts with these accounts in certain instances, the brand continues to be highly disciplined about expansion. HOKA has a superb group of wholesale partners who have continued to support the brand's strategic vision, enhance the brand credibility and awareness with core consumers and help broaden the scope of consumers that HOKA reaches. Further to that point, I'd like to provide a little more context around the HOKA brand's growth opportunity at wholesale in the upcoming year and beyond, which includes core to our brand strategy, building market share and run specialty. While in certain locations, HOKA has grown to the number one or number two brand, we have identified several regional growth opportunities within pockets of the U.S. as well as overseas. Volume expansion with strategic partners that have opened in the last two years with the opportunity to increase door counts over time and opening a select number of doors with new strategic accounts. One of these new strategic relationships, I'd like to highlight is Foot Locker. HOKA and Foot Locker have shown mutual interest for several years now, and over that time, created a distribution plan that aligns the interest of both parties. We are excited to be opening HOKA in a limited number of Foot Locker doors beginning this summer, with the intent to increase the brand's exposure with the young consumers in key markets where HOKA is lacking presence with existing distribution. We know from our experience with UGG that the Foot Locker team has a clear perspective on their consumer and believe this valuable partnership can have a considerable impact on HOKA awareness with the 18- to 34-year-old audience. Complementing the HOKA wholesale business, the brand's direct-to-consumer channel has continued to acquire new consumers as well as drive repeat purchases with existing consumers. In fiscal 2022, HOKA global direct-to-consumer acquisition increased 50% versus the prior year, and retention increased 62% versus the prior year. While acquiring new consumers is an important metric as we expand HOKA awareness, increasing customer retention is a critical component of maintaining brand strength and building loyalty. Ultimately, DDC is where HOKA can best showcase the breadth and newness of the brand's innovative product assortment, including apparel, and provide a convenient consumer experience to drive repeat purchases. Over the last year, HOKA drove a more than 40% increase in the number of consumers making multiple purchases as well as those purchasing across multiple categories. Though wholesale remains the primary acquisition point for new consumers, the HOKA brand's digital marketing activations are also driving DDC acquisition with targeted consumers. The specific focus on the 18- to 34-year-old consumer the HOKA brand's digital tactics have been successful in growing the mix of these consumers by two percentage points over last year and six percentage points over two years ago. HOKA is also seeing a fantastic consumer response of the brand's pop-up retail locations. New York has been our strongest performer, but we're also excited about the recently opened pop-up store in Chicago and a relocation in Los Angeles, where we opened a store in Venice, California. We believe HOKA can deliver a premium experience at retail locations by showcasing the breadth of the brand's product offering and driving community engagement. Over the longer term, we see an opportunity to open a limited number of permanent locations in key cities around the world including our first U.S. location in New York City by the end of fiscal 2023. The HOKA brand's new strategic wholesale distribution, targeted digital marketing activations and pop-up retail stores in key markets are collectively designed to accelerate consumer acquisition around the world through increased awareness. Our integrated approach to managing HOKA distribution continues to serve the brand well in driving balanced global growth across the HOKA ecosystem of access points. On the product front, HOKA continues to develop an assortment designed to ignite the inter athlete within all humans. The brand's inclusive approach to product management includes evolving heritage franchises to be accessible to all types of athletes, elevating performance through new innovations and expanding the consumer audience through new categories. HOKA progress on all three of these strategies in fiscal '22 by introducing the Bondi X, which is both an evolution of the Heritage Bondi style and an elevation of performance with the addition of a propulsive carbon plate to the brand's most cushioned ride. Trail blazing with the all-new SpeakGoat 05, the lightest and most grippy version of the brand's number one trail shoe, reinventing the Mach using a lower profile outsold that delivers soft cushion with an uptempo ride built for speed and capable of being a everyday trainer, disrupting the height category with the AnaCappa franchise, which is a performance hunking shoe that features a sneaker like comfort and launching the all-new Kawana, which is designed to seamlessly transition from gym workouts to daily runs to casual wear. In all, HOKA continues to develop a compelling product assortment that is built with all types of athletes in mind, serving the spectrum of performance fronters to extreme hikers and trail explorers as well as those looking for everyday all-day comfort. I want to congratulate the HOKA team on delivering another phenomenal year of growth, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2023 through continued market share gains with existing wholesale partners, expanded awareness with new consumers that the brand launches its first major global marketing campaign later this summer, driving acquisition and replenishment activity through our direct-to-consumer channel and introducing innovative products with the brand signature HOKA Rod. Turning to Teva. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 increased 17% versus last year to a record $163 million. Growth this year was driven by the brand's leadership in sports sandals and progress building share in closed-toe categories, highlighted by the success of the hurricane and the Rembert franchise. While wholesale drove the majority of growth for Teva in FY '22. The brand was able to comp the exceptional DTC growth experienced in the prior fiscal year. Success at DTC was driven by a significant increase in retained consumers, which the brand will look to replicate in the upcoming year. Shifting to Koolaburra. Global revenue in fiscal 2022 decreased 9% versus last year to $69 million due to the disruption of wholesale deliveries that resulted from pandemic-related bottlenecks. Despite this, the Koolaburra brand's D2C business increased 35% over last year and is now 3x the size of DTC volume two years ago. And finally, Sanuk Global revenue in fiscal year 2022 increased 3% to $43 million. We are pleased with the brand's performance driven by our greater mix of full-price business and an increase in higher price point items. With respect to channel performance in fiscal year 2022, both wholesale and DTC drove double-digit growth over the prior year, reflecting the strength of our omnichannel brand management. For the year, global wholesale revenue increased 31% over last year and 39% over two years ago with four out of five brands posting double-digit increases this year. Wholesale dollar growth was primarily driven by the momentum of global HOKA as the brand continues to gain market share, refilling the marketplace inventories for domestic UGG accounts and the A-brands international markets returning to growth, benefiting from the marketplace reset activities over the past few years that cleaned up distribution in EMEA and localized product and marketing strategies in China. Overall, wholesale revenue represented 61% of total revenue, which is up from 58% last year, but down from 65% two years ago. We expect to drive continued growth through wholesale, working with best-in-class partners who are showcasing our brands and attracting new consumers around the world. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, revenue for the year increased 14% over last year and 65% over two years ago to $1.2 billion. We experienced year-over-year gains in both physical retail as we lap closures during the prior year and online where we have focused our investments to drive new consumer acquisition and increase retention. Importantly, our DTC business is growing globally and across multiple brands as both domestic and international DDC increased double digits over last year, and four out of our five brands experienced growth on top of the exceptional increases achieved in the prior year with HOKA and OG accounting for the vast majority of dollar volume gains. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 financial results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2023. Steve? Thanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2022 represented another phenomenal year for Deckers as our portfolio of brands delivered revenue and earnings growth above 20%. We continue to drive progress towards our long-term vision to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through its strategic investments. These strategies continue to benefit our organization's focus and act as a North Star guiding to continued development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability. Our consistent delivery of exceptional results often overshadows the progress our organization continues to make in doing good and doing great in the communities where we operate. We've made great progress with Deckers Gives, as our employees contributed more than 14,000 volunteer hours in fiscal year 2022; our DAI initiatives as we've improved bipart representation among our leadership teams to 21%, which is up from 12% two years ago. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work that continues to drive Deckers into the future. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. Before I turn over the call, I'd like to acknowledge our announcement earlier that Wendy Yang will be stepping down from her role as President of Performance Lifestyle effective as of the end of this month. On behalf of the entire Deckers team, I want to thank Wendy for her leadership and contributions over the past seven years. With HOKA and Teva in their strongest position to date, I am confident in our ability to continue our positive momentum. I look forward to the future with this talented team and wish Wendy the best. While the company conducts a leadership search, Stefano Caroti, our President of Omnichannel, will assume Wendy's responsibility on an interim basis. Wendy will remain with the company in a consulting role through August 15, 2022, to ensure a smooth transition. As we are now ready to take questions, again, I would like to say how proud I am of the Deckers organization and our accomplishments over the past few years. We have delivered impressive results and have built a strong foundation for the future. Our future opportunities are more exciting than ever, and I look forward to the journey ahead with our team. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, our company's performance in fiscal year 2022 was outstanding as we drove top line growth above 20% and maintain top-tier operating margin in the high teens despite increased costs resulting from global supply chain disruption. Deckers has added just over $1 billion to revenue in two years, driven by the strength of demand for our brands, specifically HOKA, which has grown more than 50% for three consecutive years and UGG, which has increased double digits in back-to-back years. Our long-term strategies have continued to provide a strong foundation for driving profitable growth, and we are proud to maintain exceptional operating margin levels. We believe that with continued investment behind our key strategies, Deckers can drive profitable growth over the long term. We're excited about the year ahead, but first, let's get into our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $736 million, up 31% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by improved HOKA inventory availability that allowed the brand to deliver both record quarterly revenue of $283 million and full year revenue that was above the high end of our guidance range. Better-than-expected outperformance as we saw an extension of the holiday season with consumers willing to wait for delayed DTC shipments of product and high demand and fewer wholesale cancellations due to the continued strength of the UGG brand as accounts showed a preference to hold greater levels of key seasonal inventory as a hedge against future potential supply chain disruption that could occur in the upcoming year. And as a result, we expect this to impact UGG orders in this coming fall. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 48.7%, a 450 basis point decrease from the prior year period. The lower gross margin was primarily related to an approximate 490 basis point freight impact, primarily from increased air usage and higher ocean rates, unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced DTC and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates with partial offsets from HOKA margins benefiting from price increases and favorable brand mix. SG&A for the quarter was $277 million or 37.7% of revenue versus last year's $244 million or 43.5% of revenue. The increased spend was primarily related to higher headcount, marketing and performance-related compensation. These results, along with the lower tax rate and share count, resulted in diluted earnings per share, more than doubling last year's at $2.51. Our fourth quarter results underscore the exceptional performance demonstrated by our brands throughout fiscal year 2022, where Deckers eclipsed $3 billion of revenue for the first time. For the full fiscal year 2022, revenue increased 24% versus last year to $3.15 billion. Our company added over $1 billion in top line revenue over the last two years, delivering a nearly 50% increase over fiscal year 2020. As compared to our guidance, revenue was $90 million above the high end, primarily due to outperformance in UGG. Revenue growth versus the prior year was driven by our two largest brands as UGG increased 15% and to $1.982 billion, with growth primarily driven by wholesale refill in the U.S. and a return to growth within the brand's international regions as we signaled at the outset of fiscal year 2022. And HOKA increased 56% to $892 million, with growth driven by all global regions and channels of distribution. Gross margins for the year were down 300 basis points versus last year to 51%. The decrease in gross margin was related to an approximate 370 basis point decrease from freight, primarily due to increased air usage and higher ocean container rates and unfavorable channel mix as wholesale growth outpaced direct-to-consumer, with partial offsets from a greater mix of HOKA revenue, fewer closeouts and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. For the full fiscal year, we incurred freight costs that were more than $100 million above the prior year, excluding the impact of higher volumes. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.043 billion, up 20% versus the prior year, $870 million. SG&A represented 33.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2022 as compared to 34.2% in fiscal year 2021. Higher dollar spend was primarily related to increased marketing to build global awareness of the UGG and HOKA brands, increased compensation costs for added headcount to support our scaling organization and higher warehouse costs to support the growth of our brands. This resulted in a full year 2022 operating margin of 17.9%, which is at the high end of our original guidance range of between 17.5% and 18%. Despite the freight cost being well above what we anticipated at the outset of the year, we were able to deliver this operating margin result through disciplined management of variable expenses. For the year, our tax rate was 20%, which compares favorably to last year's 23.7%. Taxes were lower this year, primarily as a result of certain discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter and a higher proportion of international revenue. With these results, Deckers delivered another record diluted earnings per share of $16.26, which compares to $13.47 in fiscal year 2021. This result is more than $1 above the high end of our guidance range due to the strength of our fourth quarter. The $2.79 increase as compared to last year was primarily driven by: global UGG and HOKA revenue growth; net of increased marketing; a lower tax rate; a lower share count, reflecting the benefit of our most aggressive annual share repurchase to date; and favorable foreign currency exchange rates on net revenue, with partial offsets from higher freight costs from both airfreight utilization and climbing ocean rates, higher compensation costs with increased headcount, greater warehouse costs and variable expense growth in line with revenue growth. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2022, we ended the year with $844 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $507 million, up 82% from $278 million at the same point in time last year and up 63% versus two years ago, more closely aligned with the sales growth of 48% for the same period. And due to the significant increase of ocean freight rates in the second half of fiscal year 2022, this inventory includes approximately $50 million of embedded incremental ocean freight. And during the period, we had no short-term borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital above 35%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $90 million worth of shares at an average price of $292.51. For the entire fiscal year 2022, we repurchased over 1 million shares for approximately $357 million at an average price of $341.77. At March 31, 2022, the company still had $454 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before moving to our outlook for fiscal year 2023, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate any macro supply chain impacts on our business. Prolonged transit lead times, port bottlenecks related to trucking scarcity and ocean container shortages were the most material impacts to our business in fiscal year 2022, and we expect some of these pressures will continue as we begin fiscal year 2023. While I'm pleased to report that delays and part backlog have improved, we remain cautious given the scaling size of our business risks that current or future COVID outbreaks or other global events have a domino effect across the supply chain and the potential for port labor disruption to occur later this summer. As such, we continue to prioritize receiving inventory into the country of sale and thus, expect inventory balances to remain elevated during fiscal year 2023. Given the momentum of our brands and our strong balance sheet, we are comfortable carrying higher levels of inventory to ensure demand will be fulfilled. From a factory production standpoint, we have been successful in securing additional production lines with existing partners as well as onboarding new partners. We believe this will support our plan to continue fueling the growth of our brands and anticipate that this new production will allow us to begin to see expanded capabilities and capacities as we ramp into fiscal 2023 and beyond. On the cost front, we continue to see higher prices across the supply chain. But in some cases, we have seen some moderation. From an ocean freight perspective, we anticipate this to be a headwind to the first half gross margins as we lapped last year's first half lower cost. Additionally, we have been monitoring inflationary pressures on materials, but believe that impacts from ocean freight and materials inflation can be mitigated by the price increases we implemented for HOKA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and planned increases for UGG beginning in fall of 2022. Beyond that, we continue to anticipate using airfreight in fiscal 2023, but almost exclusively for the HOKA brand as we will work to fill production gaps caused by factory disruption. While we will experience savings from less air on the outside, we still anticipate using HOKA air freight during the year, which we do not intend to cover through pricing action. With all that in mind, we have taken concrete steps to mitigate the impacts on our business from persistent supply chain disruption, including placing orders and taking possession of inventory earlier for in-demand items, carrying greater levels of inventory on key styles during this disruptive period using airfreight to strategically position HOKA for the global market share gain and improving our supply chain logistics capabilities. While some of these strategies will increase costs and reduce certain efficiencies in the short term, we believe these decisions support driving profitable top line growth over the longer term. Shifting to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect year-over-year top line revenue growth of 10% to 11%, leading to revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, with HOKA growing in the mid- to high 30% range, reaching the $1.2 billion milestone on the low end; UGG growing low single digits, accounting for the wholesale revenue that shifted into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that we anticipate will sell through during the upcoming fall season; and wholesale and DTC growth at a similar rate, reflecting the impact of strategic growth initiatives across all brands. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51.5%, which is 50 basis points higher than last year. The increase over last year anticipates less air freight and benefits from select price increases within HOKA and UGG with headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates and continued impacts from higher ocean rates. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue. Higher spend is primarily related to: investments in talent and capabilities to scale the business and remain competitive in the marketplace, increased marketing to build global HOKA awareness and broaden the brand's consumer appeal and increased travel as markets open up. With these gross margins and SG&A expectations, we expect an operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%, which is similar to fiscal 2022 levels and approximately 150 to 200 basis points above pre-pandemic levels despite persistent cost pressures related to supply chain disruptions and aligns with our commitment to remain top tier among our peer group even as we continue investing behind long-term initiatives. We are projecting a tax rate of approximately 22% to 23%. All of this results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $17.40 to $18.25. The Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, which is elevated versus prior years as we scale infrastructure to align with our growing organization. Key areas of investment include: additional warehouse space, capital IT projects and refreshing certain existing retail stores as well as opening strategic new locations for HOKA and UGG. Our fiscal 2023 guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact for additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and geopolitical tensions. With continued uncertainty in the world and disruptions still impacting the supply chain, we will not be providing quarterly guidance. But similar to last year, we expect to drive full year growth and be profitable in all four quarters, but the quarterly cadence will likely be different than last year as we expect more pressure in the first half of the year compared to last. Some of the items driving quarterly differences year-over-year include: lower gross margins expected in the first half of the year as compared to last year due to higher ocean freight expense, planned increases to marketing investments in the first half to support HOKA launching its first major global campaign alongside new product introductions and higher talent costs related to investing in our workforce and adding headcount. With these impacts and a strengthening U.S. dollar, we expect lower profitability in the first quarter as compared to last year. Thanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yes, sure, John. This is Steve. I'll go first. So on the UGG, you're right. When you consider what we did in the fourth quarter, again, demonstration of how strong the brand performed, how relevant the brand was. We also did see strategic partners, wholesale accounts who took inventory in knowing that they weren't going to sell it through in the fourth quarter. So as we expect, they'll carry it in knowing that there are supply chain disruptions they're happy to carry it into our fiscal year '23, which we expected to sell through. We do see that more as an impact in kind of Q3, Q4. And you're right, so the underlying growth on that is more mid-single digits versus the low single digits that we were kind of thinking previously. Yes. Thanks, John. And I think that's a good way to look at it now. Again, we're in a year of a lot of uncertainties, so a lot to work through. But I think we're thinking along those lines. And so yes, this is a year of investment coming on the heels of two years of significant top line growth, kind of we'll work through this year. But I think generally, how you said it is kind of a good way to think about it, and then we'll see how this year progresses. Yes. Yes. So I think on that, Mackenzie, that on the Q4 hit, you're right, a little bit more, and that was really driven by freight. And that -- and within the freight, there was the ocean combination, but there was also more air freight as we used air to bring in the HOKA product, which really helped drive the top line on the HOKA sales for the quarter. So that was an important element to be able to get that product in. As we said going forward, our expectation is we will incur some headwinds with ocean freight in the first half of the year as we're lapping a year that didn't have that freight, and then we do expect to reduce our air freight usage. So sitting on a better inventory position this year going into FY '23, our expectation is that we'll need to use less air freight, which should help margins this year versus last year. Yes. I think it's -- this is Steve, John. It's a big question, and I think no one knows for certain how all this plays out. I think and expect is we should see improvement, but I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon, right? And that's really what we've modeled in. So on that, from a gross margin perspective, we're assuming ocean freight does not significantly improve this year versus last. Although last year in the first half, we were not expensing through the inventory at these higher levels of inventory. So FY '23 will be a full year of expensing that higher ocean rate. We're using pricing to offset most of that. So we're able to pick up a little bit through some of the pricing increases. We're not using, as we said in the prepared remarks, using price increases to offset the air. So as we move in and supply chain disruption improves, margins should improve as we reduce our air freight usage. And as we said, again, we're planning to use less airfreight this year than what we used last year. So I think that's kind of one dynamic. Then on inflation, we haven't yet seen too much of that impact, although we know it's coming, right? So we've been anticipating disruption, some inflation. That's why we're bringing more inventory in earlier. That's why you're seeing our inventory sit a little bit higher than where it has been in historic levels. But as we call out on a multiyear comparison, our inventory growth is still in line with sales growth. So that's something that we'll keep an eye on. We're able to benefit a little of that through materials inflation by having the inventory now. But it is something that we're going to keep a close eye on because that is something that we expect could present itself as a headwind. And again, we'll look at pricing structure then. So to answer your question, I think it's too early to know long term how all this plays out. We think the guidance, as best we know today, factors most of this in. And then hopefully, we start to see some improvement longer term, but our expectation isn't that you're going to see anything improve much in our current fiscal year '23. Yes. And I think also, John, on that, as we've said before, brand awareness of HOKA, relatively speaking, is still low. And so we can strategically use these wholesale accounts to build that brand awareness. And then we do see a high conversion rate down the road where they come to us direct. So this is -- it's a great way to build brand awareness, using these relationships in a strategic partnership to really get the brand out there in front of consumers. Yes. And one other opportunity that we've talked about within the UGG brand is the loyalty program. We have now almost 6 million consumers, I believe, in our loyalty program. Those are our best consumers. They shop most frequently to spend more money than somebody who's not in loyalty program. And this is an emerging opportunity for HOKA as well down the road that we can use to kind of further bolster the strength of our DTC channel. Thanks, John. Yes. And then, Paul, to answer your questions on supply chain, so just going down the list, I would say our capacity is good, right? We have the factory capacities that we need for all the brands, but particularly HOKA increasing going into the second half of the year. So that's good. Shipping times are still a challenge, right? We've had to put buffers into our lead times for product creation and then when we put our buys in. So there's a level of uncertainty that comes with that, but we're managing that through that well, but it is from the time inventory leaves the factory to our DCs is still longer than we would like, obviously. Port bottlenecks, and particularly in Long Beach, we're seeing a little bit of improvement there. Things are coming in a little bit faster. But I hope I'm wrong, but I personally think there's just a lull before we come into the fall inventory starting to ramp up again. So I'm optimistic that, that will continue, but I'm a little nervous that when we get into peak selling season, that's going to jump up again. Inventory and visibility of that inventory and timing as to when it's going to come in, still a challenge for our teams, their customer experience and the sales team are having to rebalance orders against inventory availability. So that's just a lot of heavy lifting that the teams have to go through. We don't see a lot of improvement on that yet still because the challenge with the port is we don't know which container is going to come in and win. But -- and then on the logistics side of it from a DC perspective, the investments we've made in the last couple of years are paying off. We have a little bit of work to do and just stabilizing some of the newer DCs in Europe and the Midwest, but we're excited that we have these underway and we're gearing up for continued growth. So I think the hope there is that the shipping lead times and the bottlenecks of the port by it a little bit. And I think other than that, we're really in good shape. Yes. And I do think, and I really believe that bringing this inventory orally and carrying a little bit is going to serve us well because we need the inventory in the marketplace to be able to sell it. And it's a very uncertain environment right now, still probably more uncertain than it was a year and even last year ago -- two years ago. So I'm excited that we have this inventory coming in. We're in good place. We just need to get it out to the marketplace now and just keep going after it. Yes. A good question. And as you know, we don't necessarily comment on current activity. But I can speak to the year we just completed. And as I said, it's the most aggressive share repurchase that we've ever done at prices higher than where we currently sit. So clearly, this is something that we're watching very closely, active discussion on. But yes, we recognize where our price is at and where the company is going. So that is something that we take into account."

I'm excited to review our third quarter results that underscore the momentum of our brands and their continued execution of key strategy as we build the future of Deckers brand. As we continue to navigate a challenging logistics environment, I reflect on both the exceptional demand for the UGG and HOKA brands and the added pressure we face to keep pace with their growth in a constrained environment. While we don't currently see signs that elevated logistics costs or supply chain bottlenecks will subside anytime soon, we do see value in supporting our strong brands through expediting key product inventory, giving our brands the opportunity to gain market share. Steve will provide a more detailed update on the status of our supply chain network and the actions we're implementing to provide our brands with the best opportunity to thrive in this challenging marketplace now and into the future. With that said, Decker's third quarter revenue increased 10% over the prior year to $1.188 billion, representing our largest quarter in history. We saw balanced growth across our entire brand portfolio as direct-to-consumer, wholesale and multiple geographies drove impressive results. Performance in the quarter and throughout the year has been the result of our execution on our long-term strategy, including driving HOKA, diversifying UGG, building DTC and developing our international market. More specifically, we have made progress across these key areas as HOKA grew 30% in the quarter despite port congestion and inventory constraint and has grown 54% year-to-date over prior year, contributing half of our total portfolio's incremental revenue. UGG increased 8% over last year in Q3 and has driven double-digit growth year-to-date, propelled by global adoption of the brand's diverse product assortment. Direct-to-consumer growth outpaced wholesale growth, improving DTC mix to 50% of third quarter revenue, up from 48% last year and 44% two years ago. And our international regions contributed a significant portion of global growth year-to-date, increasing 27% over the prior year and outpacing the US increase of 19%. For UGG, our international regions have sold their most diverse offering of UGG products ever, which helped the brand deliver impressive global growth fiscal year-to-date. In addition, with HOKA continuing to expand its share of the global performance market, we believe our portfolio contains two of the strongest brands in the footwear industry with much more promising growth ahead. Now let's get into some of the brand highlights, starting with UGG. Global UGG third quarter revenue was $946 million, reflecting an 8% increase versus last year and a 21% increase versus two years ago in the brand's largest quarter. These results, when combined with the UGG brand's outstanding first half, equate to fiscal year global revenue growth of 13% above last year and 21% above two years ago, reflecting the continued steady growth in the US, which is up high-single-digits on top of last year's mid-teens increase and a strong return to growth within the brand's international region, which have increased north of 20% versus last year and double-digits versus two years ago, all of which has been fueled by a diverse assortment of compelling UGG products across gender and categories that are being embraced by a broader and younger consumer base. In terms of the UGG brand success, year-to-date, the majority of growth has come from categories outside of women's classic food. This includes continued gains across men's and kids footwear, women's slippers and fluff as well as apparel and accessories. While these categories are driving the bulk above growth, it is important to note that women's Classics have also performed very well this year. Fiscal year-to-date, women's Classic boots have driven year-over-year revenue growth, represent a smaller percentage of total brand revenue, and reflect greater style diversity within the category as items outside of the core, such as the Ultra Mini Classic Clear and Neumel have been key drivers of consumer acquisition this year. The Neumel with its broad consumer appeal is this year's largest dollar volume style across the entire UGG assortment. The UGG product and design teams have done a great job developing companion versions to build a franchise which continues to be a large driver of men's growth. Additionally, our consumer data has shown that the adoption of UGG Men\u2019s product skews younger, as the 18 to 34-year age group represents a larger portion as compared to the brand average. And the Neumel remains a top acquisition style amongst these consumers. Our product teams are actively utilizing these insights to design new styles that will allow us to build upon momentum with these target consumers. Turning to kids footwear. UGG has driven impressive gains in kids categories over the past few years. We believe this is a strong indicator of brand health as purchasing patterns reflect consumers buying UGG for the family with the majority of top styles representing popular items from the men's and our women's product range. These bundled purchases are obviously great for increasing current values and wholesale open to buy but also act as a great avenue to introduce UGG to the next generation of consumers. Beyond footwear, UGG has been focused on acquiring new consumers through a compelling apparel assortment. To build awareness in the category, UGG developed it's first-ever apparel dedicated marketing campaign, which helped drive a 40% increase in apparel consumer acquisition year-to-date. Our consumers have responded particularly well to ready-to-wear sportswear and outerwear items that contain visual UGG DNA, logo treatment and deliver on the expected feeling of UGG. This was the first season for a number of retailers carrying UGG apparel, many of whom are concentrated in the youth and sports lifestyle channels. These channels have been driving strong performance with UGG footwear for sometime now. And we're excited that they are on board to expand into a head-to-toe UGG offering. On the domestic front, this is the fourth consecutive year UGG has delivered strong year-to-date growth in the U.S. where brand consideration remains at an all-time high among 18-to-34-year-old according to Hugo. The brand's development of a more youthful and diverse product assortment as well as the ongoing U.S. wholesale marketplace management strategy has helped us strategically expand within youth and sports lifestyle accounts. While UGG has built market share across its account base, the youth and sports lifestyle accounts have significantly outpaced growth with department stores. Additionally, UGG has driven significant gains in DTC acquisition with 18-to-34-year-olds over the past two years, as this age group has grown at a 25% CAGR year-to-date over the same period of fiscal 2020. Critical to this success has been the product adoption among those younger consumers who are purchasing both heritage products like the classic short and mini, but also new franchises like the Neumel, Fluff, Tasman and Classic Clear. From an international standpoint, regions outside of the U.S. have accounted for approximately half of UGG's growth this year, with EMEA and China driving the majority of gains over last year. Approximately three years ago, UGG implemented a marketplace reset strategy in the EMEA region based on the successful strategy that reignited the brand in the U.S. This involved a reduction of wholesale accounts to the tune of approximately 35% over the last three years, allocating and segmenting core product and elevating brand positioning while also working to create demand for complementary UGG products in new categories. Beyond the marketplace activities in EMEA, the UGG marketing team began localizing global content to more effectively connect with consumers living in European and Asian countries. More recently, UGG developed market-specific collaboration and brought on local influencers to help highlight the brand's compelling product. These actions have help to drive the international turnaround of UGG which is now delivering growth in high full price sell-through with the brand's most diverse product assortment effort. Importantly, the return to growth of international UGG regions aligns with our global category growth initiatives, further aiding the brand's diversification into categories outside of women's classic. Fiscal year-to-date, women's core classics and derivatives have moderated to below 40% of international revenue. This is more in line with the U.S. and compares to north of 50% just three years ago. With a tightened supply of core product, international regions are driving healthy growth with popular global styles such as the Fluff franchise, Ultra Mini, Classic Clear and the Neumel. By highlighting new categories, reducing the supply of core product and tailoring marketing campaigns to local consumers, UGG has begun to expand its audience to younger consumers in both Europe and China. In Europe, this has led to new strategic points of distribution in the youth and sports lifestyle channel. The volume generated with these retail partners is still relatively small but growing significantly faster than average. And if the U.S. is any indication, these emerging segments can be a big driver of growth and volume in the future. Similar to the U.S., we believe younger consumers are leading the UGG brand increased popularity among international markets. The brand has worked hard to create localized content that resonates with sub-35 age consumers in their respective markets. In Germany, France and the U.K., this age group is driving over 40% of traffic conversion from paid social. In China, this age group is driving DTC growth in key franchises including global styles such as left and the Classic Clear. The UGG team has a lot to be proud of with the progress it has made as the brand continues to drive global growth with a diverse assortment of in-demand product.  Looking ahead, we were excited for us to build upon this year's head-to-toe demand with a compelling new rainwear proposition that features two new styles, the [indiscernible] and the Tasman which we believe will help the brand further expand its year-round appeal to consumers around the world. We are already receiving great feedback on the sell-through of this collection of rainwear product and are excited to share more on our year-end call. Congratulations to the team on a great fall season, and we look forward to continued success this spring. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue in the third quarter was $185 million, reflecting a 30% increase versus last year and nearly double the volume of two years ago, despite dealing with stockouts and delayed inventory, HOKA performed well in the quarter, driven by global strength in the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased 52% over last year, and continued global wholesale market share gains, particularly among international regions as unit growth outpaced domestic. Fiscal year-to-date global HOKA revenue has increased 54% versus last year, reflecting strength across the brand's ecosystem of Access Point as domestic, international, wholesale and direct-to-consumer continue to drive impressive growth. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, we have seen strong global demand for HOKA year-to-date as US search interest increased 74% over the prior year, according to Google trends. New consumers visiting the European HOKA website during Q3 increased 88% over last year helping the region maintain the highest CDC growth rate thus far in fiscal 2022 and drove a more than 30% increase in conversion rate during China's Double 11 event, demonstrating improved awareness in the region. DTC continues to be a great avenue for HOKA to make connections with consumers, drive replenishment and increased category adoption as it more effectively displays the breadth of the brand's product assortment. We are actively testing and developing the HOKA consumer experience at pop-ups in the US and owned locations in China. In China, we plan to utilize strategic retail locations to continue building HOKA brand awareness as we develop the marketplace further and create a model for future wholesale partners to leverage. In the US, we have seen great engagement from consumers at pop-up locations and are exploring other select cities to test the HOKA experience. At the same time, HOKA is building the experience at DTC, the brand continues to build credibility and awareness with consumers through partnerships with strategic retailers. This spring, HOKA will be strategically expanding with key partners to satisfy incremental demand and further augment the brand's market share. We are pleased that our partners have continued to express excitement about the HOKA brand and their desire to expand further, and we look forward to continuing to grow those relationships. At the same time, we remain disciplined in our approach to steadily and sustainably building HOKA to a multibillion-dollar brand over time.  Shifting to product highlights for the third quarter. We launched the Bondi X at the beginning of October. This innovative style combines the signature cushion of a traditional Bondi with a carbon fiber plate to give athletes a more propulsive and efficient ride. The Bondi X launch drove significant traffic to hoka.com, 65% of which were first-time visitors. The style was even named one of the best running shoes according to GQ's 2021 Fitness Awards. Beyond the Bondi X, the HOKA brand is expanding consumer awareness with two of its newer franchises, the Rincon and the Mach. Both franchises were designed for an audience of consumers under 35 years old. The HOKA team strategically developed Rincon and Mach social content for platforms, possessing a higher concentration of this key demographic. As a result, the Rincon and Mach have been key catalysts for the HOKA brands accelerated acquisition of younger consumers, and these franchises are driving superb growth. On the collaboration front, HOKA partnered with global luxury brand Moncler to release a limited edition of the HOKA [indiscernible]. This was a great opportunity for HOKA build global awareness by partnering with a well-known European fashion luxury brand. The collaboration drove significant positive PR for HOKA and sold out in the first hour of availability. Collaborations like this are a great indicator of the brand's growing appeal beyond its traditional performance roots and into the space of fashion. While fashion is not a top priority for HIKA right now, we see this as an opportunity for the brand to capitalize more broadly in the future. To close HOKA, I'd like to congratulate the entire team for the brand being named Footwear News Brand of the Year. This is a fantastic accomplishment and speaks to the incredible momentum of HOKA as the brand marches closer to $1 billion in revenue and beyond. We have enormous confidence in the brand's ability to continue building share in a highly competitive marketplace. While we continue to operate in this constrained environment, we are prioritizing the fulfillment of HOKA demand, though carefully balancing stringent quality standards as the brand's growth has required adding further manufacturing capacity. Ramping production of this highly technical performance product will require some additional time, but our measured approach will ensure HOKA is built to become a long-term major player in the performance space, while delivering the quality product our consumers expect. With respect to channel performance in the third quarter, global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 13% versus the prior year and plus 42% versus two years ago. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 11% versus last year, fueled by strength in both retail stores and online. UGG and HOKA drove the majority of the year-over-year dollar volume increases, but DTC demand was robust across the portfolio. Facing bottlenecks during the UGG brand historical peak period of demand, we took specific actions that benefited UGG GDC, which included encouraging preorders on key styles to help smooth demand, carrying a broader exclusive assortment that provided the option of alternate in-stock products where there were shortages and offering the option to purchase back order products that had incoming inventory. In the constrained supply environment, we have experienced this year, our omnichannel capabilities proved advantageous in reducing the impact on the UGG brand business. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue in the third quarter increased 7% versus last year and 14% versus two years ago. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by international UGG and global HOKA with slight offset from a reduction in domestic UGG that resulted from earlier shipments of fall products as compared to the prior year. Wholesale comparisons remain unique as macro logistics pressures and bottlenecks continue to alter shipment timing as compared to historical patterns. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our third quarter financial results, status of the dynamic supply chain challenges facing our industry and our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Dave's remarks regarding the success of our key strategies. With three quarters of the year now behind us, including the peak UGG holiday season, we feel great about the strength of our brand portfolio. Throughout the year, UGG has driven global growth with a diverse assortment that is resonating with consumers across multiple categories, including apparel and accessories. At the same time, HOKA continues to build share with compelling performance products across its ecosystem of Access Point. The growth delivered by our two largest brands was achieved despite significant supply chain disruption, that we expect to remain a headwind for the foreseeable future. While this challenge persists, we have a great deal of confidence in the demand for our brands, bolstered by our omni-channel capabilities, flexible operating model and fortified balance sheet. Ultimately, we believe that prioritizing our long-term strategic goals will allow our brands to remain successful and drive continued market share gains. Now for the financial specifics of Q3 results. Third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue was $1.188 billion, representing a 10% increase versus last year and a 27% increase versus two years ago. Q3 growth was driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA, as international UGG increased 29% versus last year, led by a return to growth in our EMEA region and an acceleration in China. And global HOKA increased 30%, aided by a more than 50% increase in DTC. Gross margins for the third quarter were down 470 basis points versus last year to 52.3%. The decrease as compared to last year was due to higher freight costs as ocean container rates have significantly increased. Third-party delivery fees have increased, and we have used a substantial amount of air freight. The increased cost in freight, including all of these components, amounted to approximately $55 million above last year in the quarter. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $328 million, up 15% from last year's $285 million. Increased spend was primarily driven by greater marketing expense to increase localized content highlight new categories and fuel brand heat globally as well as higher warehouse expenses as we grow our logistics network and other variable expenses. Our tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which compares favorably to the 22.2% last year due to discrete tax benefits and a higher proportion of international revenue. This resulted in a diluted earnings per share of $8.42 for the quarter, which compares to $8.99 in last year's third quarter. The $0.57 decrease versus last year was primarily driven by lower gross margins that resulted from higher freight costs, higher marketing, warehouse and variable expenses with partial offsets from the revenue growth of our two largest brands and benefits from a lower tax rate and share count. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, we ended December with $998 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory, including in transit was $551 million, up 80% from $305 million at the same time last year, with the large majority of that increase still in transit and delayed due to port congestion. And we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $131 million worth of shares at an average price of $369.12. Fiscal year-to-date through December, we have repurchased approximately 736,000 shares, spending a total of $267 million. At December 31, 2021, the company still had $544 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before we move into our final outlook update for fiscal year 2022, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate future effects on our business. The most material challenge facing our business continues to be prolonged transit times for items produced overseas to reach our warehouses. This has led to a much higher proportion of inventory classified as in transit. At September quarter end, we noted that approximately 45% of inventory was in transit, which compared to roughly 20% in the prior year at the same point in time. As of December 31, we have not seen improvement as approximately 50% of our inventory remained in transit, which compares to roughly 25% in the prior year at 12/31. We do not expect this issue to be resolved near-term. And as a result, we plan to carry elevated levels of inventory at fiscal 2022 year end and into fiscal year 2023, placing an emphasis on receiving product into the country of sale at the expense of inventory efficiencies in the short-term. We will continue to utilize airfreight where strategically necessary to import products and leapfrog port congestion to maintain share. More specifically, with the rate of growth our brands are experiencing, particularly HOKA, which has more consistent demand throughout the year as well as a greater percentage of at-once business. Aligning sufficient inventory levels with elevated demand has become increasingly difficult. To help offset this issue, we have stepped up our airfreight usage to supplement ocean and port delays, but shipping by air is causing gross margin compression. Our strategy is to prioritize HOKA market share in the ultra competitive performance footwear space. And as such, we are willing to maintain higher air freight usage to fulfill this demand. Meanwhile, the HOKA team is actively working through product launch adjustments to best align with the current logistics environment. On pricing, we spoke last quarter about raising prices on select HOKA styles this spring and taking a look at UGG for the fall of 2022 season. Our product teams have completed a thorough review of their respective brand, price elasticity and are continuing to adjust prices on target styles accordingly. While these changes can help offset some of the inflationary pressures on materials, we still expect elevated freight expense to be a near-term headwind above these pricing adjustments. Please note this does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year as pricing and freight are only a few of the many variables that factor into our gross margin forecast. From a factory production standpoint, we maintain a network of strategic third-party manufacturers and have been actively seeking additional production lines with existing and potential new partners. Despite ongoing activities, we expect some of our growth in the upcoming fiscal year to be limited by manufacturing capacity constraints to ensure product quality and integrity, particularly with HOKA, given the complex nature of the brand's high-performance products, it will take time to ramp-up additional production. These efforts are made more difficult by the existence of the ongoing pandemic. We will provide a more thorough update on our fiscal year 2023 expectations during our year end call in May. Now with that context in mind, and moving to guidance for the full fiscal year 2022 and on revenue, we are narrowing our range to reflect a $20 million increase on the low end and maintaining the high end of our prior guidance, now expecting a range of $3.03 billion to $3.06 billion. This represents growth of approximately 19% to 20% over fiscal year 2021. Gross margin is now expected to be at or slightly below 51.5%. Included in this is our annual spend on freight that is now projected to be $100 million over last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue, and we expect our operating margin to land within the prior range at approximately 17.5% of revenue. We now expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5% for the year. And taking these into account, we are narrowing our prior earnings per share expectation to a range of $14.50 to $15.15 for full fiscal year 2022. At this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate additional significant supply chain disruption beyond what we have covered here today excludes onetime charges and does not contemplate impact from additional share repurchases. We look forward to providing additional updates on next year during our fourth quarter call in May. Thanks, everyone. And I will now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. Our brands have performed exceptionally well this year, notwithstanding logistical challenges facing our industry. Fiscal year-to-date, Deckers has delivered revenue growth of 22% above last year and 37% above two years ago, while maintaining top-tier operating margins among peers. Our impressive margins have been achieved as we continue investing in the long-term future of our organization and prioritize growing the market share of our exceptional brands all while navigating headwinds related to the global pandemic and supply chain disruption. As I said at the opening, our brands are incredibly well positioned across the globe, but demand continues to outpace our current ability to supply it. And we are managing the business to deliver strong results in this uncertain environment. We have continuously evolved our strategies to mitigate the impacts of the dynamic state of the logistics environment. Key actions we are taking include tightening our product assortments to increase SKU efficiency, raising prices selectively based on assessing the competitive landscape of our brands, utilizing the strength of our balance sheet to carry increased levels of inventory in response to supply chain disruption optimizing channel mix to fulfill consumer demand and scaling production to support the growth of our brands. With the realities of the current logistics environment, we recognize that HOKA will remain in chase mode for much of the upcoming year. HOKA has tremendous runway ahead, and we will continue to provide the resources necessary to build HOKA into a major multibillion-dollar player in the performance space. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to recognize and thank our employees for how well they have managed an intense workload, especially as we all continue to deal with the added stress and struggles caused by the ongoing pandemic. We are doing our best to support our employees and their families through this difficult period of uncertainty. Thank you all for joining us today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more on the bright future of Deckers brand. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Camilo Lyon with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And very nice job in a very tough environment.\nDave Powers: Hey, Camilo.\nCamilo Lyon: I wanted to want to start off. Hi. How are you? I wanted to want to start off the conversation on where you left off on HOKA, if we could. You talked, Dave, you just said that it's going to remain in chase mode. Up 30% is certainly nothing to sneeze that for sure it's a fantastic growth rate. But clearly, it seems like you could have done more if you had more product. Can you help us think about what the right run rate is going forward, given everything you said about the lack of inventory availability and the slow build that you expect to see on alternative factory and manufacturing partners to ramp up that production?\nDave Powers: Yes. I appreciate the question. And obviously, it's a pretty dynamic environment. 30%, as you said, we're proud of that result, considering all the challenges we had getting inventory through the bottlenecks. And obviously, we had to spend a little bit more in air freight to mitigate some of those challenges. And what we've seen, quite honestly, in the last six months is the demand for the brand has accelerated from what we thought it was going to be six months ago. And so we are in chase mode. It's a good position to be in. It's challenging in this environment. We think we'd be closer to a 50% growth rate on an annual basis. And that could be higher depending on what inventory we can get into the country and get it out to the marketplace to the consumer. But generally speaking, we're pleased with the makeup of the HOKA business globally. We're seeing great traction in the international markets. North America continues to be very strong. Strong sell-through -- and the challenge is that accelerated demand has put more pressure on the supply chain. So we've had to go secure additional sourcing partners in the Far East. And that doesn't happen overnight, obviously. So with the challenge of slowed inbound into the DC on a regular basis, bringing on new factories to be able to keep up with the increased demand over the next year and beyond. There's a lot going on there, but the bottom line is the demand is exceptional. The teams are doing everything they can to keep the brand heat going and stealing market share. And as you saw in the quarter, in the year, we're spending money to maintain the sales even at 30%. So we are air-freighting a lot of products. That's a headwind that we've absorbed this year while still delivering guidance of a healthy operating margin at the end of the year, and something we're going to continue to evaluate. But we are taking, what I would say is a more cautious, but aggressive stance on the HOKA brand and all of our brands, the goal is continuing to drive top line and steal market share where we can. And we have to pay some more in air freight and short-term to enable that growth and continue the dominant pace that HOKA has, we're comfortable doing that. And we're figuring out how do we absorb that, but still deliver top tier results, which is what we're doing and confident that we can mitigate the challenges going forward.\nCamilo Lyon: Great. Thanks for that Dave, certainly a great position to be in. I guess, on that same sort of broader topic in terms of gross margin and pricing actions that you're taking and layering that into how you're diverting products from wholesale to will -- how do you think about the balance of those inputs to protect the share that you have, but also continue to deliver the growth that you have been experiencing. Is there an added intention to raise price to mitigate the -- what seems to be like well long duration of air freight expenses into next year? And do you expect to favor or prioritize your DTC channel more than you have been, again, to serve that direct customer more so?\nDave Powers: Yes. I mean these are all what you're describing are all the levers that we get to pull in this environment. And the good news is that the strength of the brand gives us the ability to raise prices where we think we can -- and to give you a little bit more clarity on that, HOKO started raising prices in December in our Spring product and on some of the Bondi, Clifton and Rincon. And that a lot of that price increase is hitting right now in this quarter in Q1 roughly around 6% to 8% increase across the board. And the HOKA brand is continuing to look at opportunities going into fall and next spring to continue to do that to offset some of the headwinds in supply costs. From an UGG perspective, we've been raising prices strategically and surgically over the last couple of years. But we are taking a broader look at the assortment for this coming fall and you're going to see some price increases on some of our bigger styles, not the classic short, but you'll see it in Neumel and Classic Mini and other few areas where we are going to be raising prices. We have a good deal of inventory coming in for UGG, which is at the older price, the cost of making that product, which is good for us. So that helps with the logistics headwinds and then some of the price increases that we think we can put in will also help on the margin going forward. But I think I just want to make it super clear. We don't see the challenges with supply chain and the bottlenecks at the port, getting better for quite some time. And so we're taking that stance going forward that what we're experiencing now is going to continue, and we're planning the business going forward. With that in mind, until we see signs that things are opening up, but we have not seen any of those signals yet.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Camilo, this is Steve. Just to add to that. You mentioned increasing price to offset. On air, we're not necessarily seeing or looking to offset the air in.\nDave Powers: Correct? Yes.\nSteve Fasching: So the increases that we have are offsetting material inflation and ocean freight, but we see air more as transitory -- at what point does that get better, we're not certain, but we won't be able to completely offset the air increase.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. UGG growth 8% in the quarter, I'd just say that's pretty impressive considering there was a lot of concerns out there. Dave, Steve, could you may be potentially quantify if there was a material shift into 4Q fiscal? Because I think you talked about 50% of the inventory was in transit.\nDave Powers: Yes. So I think are kind of you're saying is there a shift between quarters. Remember, we haven't talked much about the quarter cadence. So we're really looking at this kind of on a full year basis. I know various models kind of had different scenarios in terms of what kind of what was projected for UGG. As we've said, largely the year is being delivered as we've said and expected from an UGG perspective. So -- as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected that there are going to be shipment timing issues between quarters, which is part of the reason that we haven't given quarterly guidance. I think earlier on, we anticipated more growth in the front half of the year. We've seen some of that drift into the back half. But I think from how we're seeing the cadence of the year from an UGG perspective, we're still on target with kind of what we've said, and we've seen the cadence of the business kind of continue as we expected. So in good shape, I think I agree with you. I think there was some concern on the performance of UGG in the quarter. I think we've demonstrated the brand has performed well, demand is still very strong and consumers are seeking the brand out.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And I would add, if your question was, do we see inventory delivery shift from Q4 into Q3? No, because we were chasing inventory, the majority of the quarter. There was some shift of Q3 in Q2 that we contemplated on the year-to-date results. But I think what's important on the quarter for UGG is just to understand where the growth came from. And a lot of the growth came from international regions, which is something we've been working on in transforming those marketplaces to a younger, more diverse audience and diverse product offering, consolidating wholesale accounts in Europe, the marketplace and attracting and having success with a younger consumer. -- with new product franchises such as the Fluff and the Classic Clear and the Tasman. So I'm excited about the fact that it's right on strategy, what we've been working on in those regions for the past few years. We're starting to see the results of that. It's very exciting. And it just shows the strength and the global appeal of this brand and the fashion product that we're putting into the assortment.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That's great to hear. And then I'd love to hear more about HOKA. One on the product launches. For example, the Kawana. I know it's super early. You just launched on the website. Just love to get some read on that assortment. And then I think a few quarters back, you talked about DTC getting to 50% of the company. How do we think about -- I'd love to hear how the stores, the HOKA stores, the pop-up bid in North America? And how -- what the early reads are on the HOKA store in Shanghai as we think about store expansion over time for the brand?\nDave Powers: Yes. So just on the product launches, obviously, with the supply chain challenges, the brand team has had to adjust on the fly the timing of different launches based on where they can get all the inventory here and time, et cetera. It's early days in the Kawana. We're excited about what that could do from a cross-training perspective and bringing that type of running product to a unique consumer that's looking for that from us. But we'll continue to innovate and expand into different categories as we go forward, but it's early days on that style. I think from a store perspective, we're very pleased with how things have gone so far. The store in New York is far exceeding expectations, and I think that is a good signal when you have awareness of a brand that you can see strong growth the experience that we're seeing in China is good from a traffic perspective, but conversion isn't quite as high as we'd like to be yet. And so that just speaks to people getting familiar with the brand over time. It's early days in China. People are still relatively unfamiliar with the brand. But the experience that our stores are providing for the consumer there and giving confidence to our partners in the marketplace is very strong. And so we're pleased with how things are going. But a heavy lift over time to get China to where it needs to be, but we're off to a good start. And then real optimism around what a store concept could do as we expand into the US and Europe over time as well.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And then -- this is Steve, Laurent. Just on the DTC mix, I think what you'll see in the quarter is we had strong DTC performance and it was especially strong in December. So we benefited with some short supply out in the wholesale channel, consumers coming directly to us. And I think that starts to demonstrate the strength of our DTC and omni capabilities, not necessarily representative of where the mix will be on a full year basis as it's stronger in this quarter, but a good demonstration of the progress that we're making on that front.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Great. Thank you very much for the color.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Laurent.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the UGG business, the performance. Could you maybe share a little more color on the third quarter DTC performance there. And if you could give some color on US versus international and just how we should think about the fourth quarter would be helpful?\nDave Powers: Yes. DTC business for UGG was very strong. As Steve said, particularly in the back half of December. We saw a real uptick in that business, and that continues to be a solid driver for us. And just speaks to the consumers' demand for the product. If they can't find it in wholesale, where they like to shop. They're coming to our website, and we're doing our best to service them. Broadly speaking, I'm very pleased with how the UGG brand is evolving and has evolved away from the core Classics business. We're still -- we still have a robust and healthy business there. But it's much more diverse across Tazz and Ascot and Mini and Tasman and Neumel, et cetera. The Neumel is a runaway story right now. It's the number one style across men's and women's, doing incredibly well, and it's being adopted globally and in sports lifestyle channel that is really driving a lot of business. Men's is on the upside, as we've spoken about. Kids is on the upside. And then when you look at apparel, that business seasons are now starting to contribute to some of the growth -- that business is up 50% year-to-date and with still a lot of upside in that category as well. So when you think about where this brand was a few years ago to where it is now, diversified across gender and category and then head to toe and super pleased with how we're seeing the international regions evolve both in wholesale and e-commerce. So yes, we could have done more business in the quarter with UGG. If we had -- we were able to get our hands on more inventory, and that's slowly coming in Q4. But again, the brand is in a very good place, management of the assortment and the SKUs in the marketplace is very tight and very strong, full price sell-through was there, margins are healthy. A lot of reason to be optimistic for a brand of this size. Certainly not the upside on an annual growth basis that you see with HOKA, but still very strong in the context of the footwear industry.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. That's really helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the freight picture. The $100 million that you called out, Steve, this year, just any thoughts directionally how that could look going forward? And then in the broader context, is the right way to think about it? I mean without that $100 million this year, you'd be north of 20% operating margin. So is that still eventually a level you think you can get to once everything normalizes, understanding there's a lot of uncertainty of when that happens? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Thanks, Jon. It's a good question. And clearly, it's something that we're looking at. We, again, haven't given guidance, but I think the way you're looking at it is right in terms of what the impact is. Now we did in the current year, cut back in other areas. So those are probably things we wouldn't necessarily cut back in a normal year. So you're right in terms of the $100 million, if you add that back, you get to kind of a 20%. But we have course corrected during the year and not spent as much on some other areas of the business that we typically would. So I would say stay tuned, we'll be able to give you a better picture of what that looks like. And then the other thing is it's just trying to determine when all this begins to normalize. I think a big component of the $100 million, it's clearly air freight. We're hopeful that things begin to normalize, and so we wouldn't have to use as much air freight in the future. But still, there's factory disruption, there's still port congestion. And with a brand like HOKA, we're having to use more air than what we even anticipated kind of three months ago. So that's something that we're still watching. I think the other thing just to be aware of is the increase in ocean freight. And so I think that's going to take a lot longer than the air to begin to normalize. So we'll see how all that shakes out. I think we're going to learn more in the next three months, and we'll be able to give you a better perspective of what that looks like in a couple of months on the year-end call.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I think at that point, we'll be able to share. I mean, we still need to make some investments in the business to sustain and afford. And from a logistics standpoint, DCs, infrastructure systems, talent, with this kind of demand and growth ahead of us, there's going to be some additional investments we'll need to make and we'll talk more about that going forward. So yes, to know that we could have done 20% this year with -- if we had taken out the air freight, makes us feel good, and I'm really proud of the team's ability to adjust this year to still deliver on our operating margin guidance. At this point, considering the fact that we had to absorb a $100 million bogey in the year. That just speaks to the flexibility of our model and the capabilities of the leadership team.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Great. Thanks again.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser of Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few, and I'm going to read them all. One, I would love for you to give us the sales by wholesale or DTC, whatever you prefer by brand and update full year guidance by brand, HOKA is expected to hit up 50% plus on the prior guidance, up high single-digit and so on. If you could update that. And I also wanted to know about what the merchandise margin improvements are exing out all the other stuff and inventory by brand and then transit by brand. Thank you very much.\nErinn Kohler: Hi, Sam, it's Erinn. So I'll provide you with the global wholesale and distributor sales for the third quarter just completed. So for UGG, that was $432.1 million, for HOKA $122.6 million; Teva, $16.3 million, Sanuk was $3.1 million and then other -- largely Koolaburra $24.2 million.\nSam Poser: Thanks.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And then just the guidance by brand, Sam, this is Steve. Really not a significant change. We've held the top end of the range. So feel comfortable with what we've given before. We've lowered the -- we -- sorry, increased the bottom end of the range. You can attribute that largely to some improvement in the UGG Q3 performance. So there, again, ranges consistent with what we guided to before and pretty consistent with what we said last time as well. And then \u2013 yes, sorry.\nSam Poser: And then quickly follow-up on that one. Does that mean that we'd expect a sort of a much larger sales in Q4 for HOKA to get it up to around that 70% number that you inferred on the last call, that number is going up and going to accelerate in Q4.\nDave Powers: That's how we're looking at it. Yes. Based on inventory.\nSam Poser: Okay. Good. And then I asked about merch margin and inventory as well.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So merch margins, I mean, generally speaking, the work that the teams are doing is to absorb additional costs that we're starting to see whether those materials or labor embedded into the product cost. So I would say that the margin upside is -- any upside that we see will come in price increases. The regular work that we're doing on merchandise margins is really to maintain the level of margins that we have now versus finding efficiencies and opportunities to increase margin in this environment. And we're taking a long-term view of this. As I said, we're reducing SKU counts. We're being more focused, and we're investing in and eliminating unnecessary products in the line and trying to make more -- this more efficient, but it's really maintaining margins at this point versus looking for upside in this challenging environment.\nSam Poser: And then inventory by brand and in transit by brand?\nDave Powers: Yes. I can give you inventory by brand. I don't have the in-transit rating front of me, but roughly speaking, yes. So as I said, in total, the in-transit is just above 50%. So 50% of the $551 million is in transit. The $551 million, as it roughly breaks out by brand is about $350 million on UGG, $130 million on HOKA, $27 million on Teva, $10 million on Sanuk and a little over $26 million on Koolaburra.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much gents, and continue to success.\nDave Powers: All right. Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks guys. A couple of questions. Curious when this product comes in, when it does come in late, what sort of cancellation rates you're seeing for each of the brands? And also curious have to offer discounts when the product has come in late? Or is it more an environment where your wholesale partners are just taking whatever you've got whenever you get it? That's the first question. Second, you mentioned something earlier, I think, about HOKA new partners. So I just wanted to hear a little bit more detail what's going on there. And on the HOKA wholesale business, curious if you can talk about sales to same customers versus new customers that they've seen in terms of the growth of that business this year? Thanks.\nSteve Fasching: Sure. What was\u2026\nDave Powers: Cancellation.\nSteve Fasching: Sorry, I'll start with cancellations.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nSteve Fasching: Okay, this is Steve. So we're not seeing significant cancellations. I think to the point you made, we're seeing kind of what we -- are lower than what we expected in terms of cancellation. So there -- as the brands continue to remain in demand continue to sell customers are happy to get product. So we're not seeing anything that we didn't expect. So I think from a cancellation perspective, everything is as we anticipated. And the second question was\u2026\nDave Powers: So new partners in Asia. So I think you might be referring to what I said earlier about HOKA retail stores. But the best way to think about that is partners that we have on the distributor model over in Asia. We're seeing very strong demand in those partners outside of China and Japan, we get Australia and some of the Southeast Asia countries. And then in China, what I really meant there is, over time, we will mirror the model that we've established for UGG with a handful of healthy owned retail stores and then third-party wholesale partners in region who can run stores for us. So in China, what I was speaking to is having a retail presence and showing that we are investing in the brand and creating a compelling experience for the consumer, that's all good for the distributors, potential partners that we're evaluating at the moment to see how Deckers is getting behind HOKA and gives them a lot of confidence for this brand going forward.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. The other piece is just the back of the HOKA growth this year, how did it look in terms of sales to existing customers or new doors, new partners? How does that break down?\nDave Powers: Yes. I mean, where we're able to get inventory to our partners, again, sell-through is exceptional, both existing partners, primarily in the run specialty arena. But as we talked about before, DICK'S is continuing to see very strong success. We're continuing to slowly and strategically expand with them as a partner. And so the results and the feedback from all of our wholesale partners, aside from frustration on delivery and timing that the teams had to deal with is very strong, speaking to the product and the demand for the brand and how awareness is increasing. So all good signs there, and that's on a global level. It's just really truly a matter of keeping up the demand right now, which we see accelerating on a regular basis.\nPaul Lejuez: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thank you. Good afternoon.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nJim Duffy: I wanted to start asking a question about the UGG brand and whether North America weather wasn't super cooperative through the selling season. Has the brand been diversified to the point where the weather just isn't a consideration that it used to be? Or are there other kind of changes to the brand and composition. Is it making more insulated to weather impacts?\nDave Powers: Yes, it's a good question. Weather used to be make or break for the UGG brand because we were so reliant on just kind of core products and didn't have a lot of non-weather-related options or fashionable options. So that's changed dramatically. I think weather now is -- it's either a small multi-play or up or down a few percentage points. It's probably the way to think about it. It was warmer than we expected in December, but the strength of the brand and the fashion product even though the classic still performed well, but it's really new mail, Tasman and the flood franchise that was driving the upside. And those tend to be less weather resistant for us. And as weather starting to -- or for the month of January, where weather is coal in the Northeast, we're still continuing to see strong demand for the brand. So we feel really good about the fact that we've kind of mitigated that weather impact and how important it was for our success by having a much more diverse and interesting fashionable product assortment that isn't so weather reliant. And we're going to continue to build on that for sure. And then I think if you look at the rain product that's in now, that's always been a big opportunity for us, and we have finally come to market which, I think, is a very compelling and exciting assortment in that category, we see continued upside there. And so you're going to see us build after that opportunity across men's, women's and kids as well.\nJim Duffy: Understood. Good progress. Steve, a couple of clarifications on your margin commentary. First, the $100 million in freight that you mentioned, is the convention for that comparable to the $40 million that you mentioned with the September quarter report? So effectively, you're planning $60 million incremental. Is that the right way to think about it?\nSteve Fasching: That is. Yes. So in I think you've asked the question a couple of quarters ago. So yes, in terms of -- we have stepped up the incremental amount. The full year is $100 million for all of freight. So not only the additional air freight, but inclusive of the increased rates related to ocean freight.\nJim Duffy: Got it. Okay. And then you made a comment in the prepared remarks, you talked about pricing actions and looking out to fiscal 2023, we should not consider this gross margin guidance, but you talked about pricing, not being able to fully offset the freight expense. What other variables should we be considering as we think out with that? And as part of the uncertainty and the reason you stop short of providing gross margin guidance is you don't know what type of relief you might get on the freight in fiscal 2023?\nDave Powers: Yes, good question, Jim, and thanks kind of for asking because we can provide a little clarification because it is challenging in the current environment, and that is why we're being careful about it. I think -- and we got the before I think John asked just in terms of some of the components of it. We're having to use more airfreight than what we previously anticipated, your first question. And part of that is just with some of the disruption that we're seeing continued port congestion and having in-demand brands and especially with HOKA, we need to air freight that in. So that's going to be a continued kind of headwind until we start to see some normalization around the port congestion. We're not seeing any signs of that yet. So that is a bit of an unknown as to how long that will continue. So we want to be careful about what we're seeing in respect to when we can expect to see that reduce or normalize, right? So -- and I think, as I said in three months, hopefully, we're seeing some improvement, so we can give you a better update. But right now, nothing points to that. I think the other consideration and headwinds that we're dealing with as much of the inventory that we brought in this year has put a headwind pressure related to the ocean freight. So we've been inbounding inventory. The increased expense has largely impacted Q3 and beyond, right? The first two quarters were still at inventory freight levels that were at lower rates. So that will be a continued headwind for us as we go into FY 2023. And again, we'll be able to provide a better perspective on FY 2023 in three months. But those are the headwinds that we're continuing to face. As I said in the prepared remarks, we were hopeful that we would see some improvement. We're still seeing a high level, nearly twice what we saw a year ago with in-transit inventory. So with these costs still where they're at, we're still using air freight and more than what we previously anticipated, it's just really difficult in this environment to be able to give you clear guidance on what that gross margin means. And -- so how that relates to prices is because we know some of this air will reduce in time. We just don't know when. We're not pricing that into our product price increases. So we are increasing prices that are offsetting material increases. We are increasing pricing that's setting, that's helping offset some of the increase in ocean that we expect will continue, but we're not contemplating trying to offset airfreight in that. As we said in the prepared remarks, is a strategic decision on our part to get product in here to meet demand that's in the market. We want to maintain and grow market share. So that's the strategic levers that we're using and it does come at some gross margin compression, but we're willing to take that. And then as that eases off we'll be in a better position where you'll see some gross margin expansion.\nJim Duffy: Understood. Thank you for that clarification. And like part of the point is you'll be consuming inventories brought in at those higher freight rates into fiscal 2023?\nSteve Fasching: That's correct. Correct. Yes.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nJim Duffy: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. And Dave, I just wanted ask about HOKA, you mentioned brand awareness is rising, I believe. Can you just talk about from a marketing standpoint as you look into fourth quarter and a little bit into next fiscal year? what are some of the strategies you have to continue to raise awareness for HOKA, maybe some of the events or some of the opportunities to continue to elevate the brand and raise the were not just in the US but globally?\nDave Powers: Yes. Good question, Jay. The need to continue to market this brand is intense. And I think just -- and it's beyond just the amount of dollars you throw at it. The partnerships are crucial. We're really proud of our Global IRONMAN partnership, and that's having an impact in all the international regions as well. We're looking to expand that where we can into other opportunities, continuing to work with our athletes, both in insights on product, but also expanding the breadth and the awareness of the brand and supporting our community around the globe. Those are all part of the things that we do on a regular basis. That's true to our brand and really important for the continued success. But over the past year, we brought in a new Head of Marketing to the brand. Norman Delaney, who is doing a great job. And she's also embarked on a project where we're looking at bringing on a global -- or we have brought on a global agency of record to take what we're doing from a marketing perspective to the next level. I think we've been very good at events and independent launches of products, but we're looking for \u2013 in this new approach going forward, a much more consistent voice and message and look and feel for the brand going forward on a global scale. So you'll see that to start to happen in Q1, Q2. We're going to be launching a new updated website with the brand and some of that new creative will start showing on that over the summer. And then we'll continue to build on that. But the regional global teams are very excited about the new partner from a marketing and agency perspective. And then I think this is going to just be another boost to the brand to have an elevated, consistent global marketing story that we can create more consistency across all the product launches and in the markets. And then we also signed on in addition to iron Mariner sponsorship of the primary sponsor of the UTMB series going forward. These are very important races in the space, have global reach and they're very -- the Pinnacle positioning for both hardcore runners, but also everyday runner and fitness enthusiasts.\nJay Sole: Got it. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: Thank you Jay.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm excited to review our third quarter results that underscore the momentum of our brands and their continued execution of key strategy as we build the future of Deckers brand. As we continue to navigate a challenging logistics environment, I reflect on both the exceptional demand for the UGG and HOKA brands and the added pressure we face to keep pace with their growth in a constrained environment. While we don't currently see signs that elevated logistics costs or supply chain bottlenecks will subside anytime soon, we do see value in supporting our strong brands through expediting key product inventory, giving our brands the opportunity to gain market share. Steve will provide a more detailed update on the status of our supply chain network and the actions we're implementing to provide our brands with the best opportunity to thrive in this challenging marketplace now and into the future. With that said, Decker's third quarter revenue increased 10% over the prior year to $1.188 billion, representing our largest quarter in history. We saw balanced growth across our entire brand portfolio as direct-to-consumer, wholesale and multiple geographies drove impressive results. Performance in the quarter and throughout the year has been the result of our execution on our long-term strategy, including driving HOKA, diversifying UGG, building DTC and developing our international market. More specifically, we have made progress across these key areas as HOKA grew 30% in the quarter despite port congestion and inventory constraint and has grown 54% year-to-date over prior year, contributing half of our total portfolio's incremental revenue. UGG increased 8% over last year in Q3 and has driven double-digit growth year-to-date, propelled by global adoption of the brand's diverse product assortment. Direct-to-consumer growth outpaced wholesale growth, improving DTC mix to 50% of third quarter revenue, up from 48% last year and 44% two years ago. And our international regions contributed a significant portion of global growth year-to-date, increasing 27% over the prior year and outpacing the US increase of 19%. For UGG, our international regions have sold their most diverse offering of UGG products ever, which helped the brand deliver impressive global growth fiscal year-to-date. In addition, with HOKA continuing to expand its share of the global performance market, we believe our portfolio contains two of the strongest brands in the footwear industry with much more promising growth ahead. Now let's get into some of the brand highlights, starting with UGG. Global UGG third quarter revenue was $946 million, reflecting an 8% increase versus last year and a 21% increase versus two years ago in the brand's largest quarter. These results, when combined with the UGG brand's outstanding first half, equate to fiscal year global revenue growth of 13% above last year and 21% above two years ago, reflecting the continued steady growth in the US, which is up high-single-digits on top of last year's mid-teens increase and a strong return to growth within the brand's international region, which have increased north of 20% versus last year and double-digits versus two years ago, all of which has been fueled by a diverse assortment of compelling UGG products across gender and categories that are being embraced by a broader and younger consumer base. In terms of the UGG brand success, year-to-date, the majority of growth has come from categories outside of women's classic food. This includes continued gains across men's and kids footwear, women's slippers and fluff as well as apparel and accessories. While these categories are driving the bulk above growth, it is important to note that women's Classics have also performed very well this year. Fiscal year-to-date, women's Classic boots have driven year-over-year revenue growth, represent a smaller percentage of total brand revenue, and reflect greater style diversity within the category as items outside of the core, such as the Ultra Mini Classic Clear and Neumel have been key drivers of consumer acquisition this year. The Neumel with its broad consumer appeal is this year's largest dollar volume style across the entire UGG assortment. The UGG product and design teams have done a great job developing companion versions to build a franchise which continues to be a large driver of men's growth. Additionally, our consumer data has shown that the adoption of UGG Men's product skews younger, as the 18 to 34-year age group represents a larger portion as compared to the brand average. And the Neumel remains a top acquisition style amongst these consumers. Our product teams are actively utilizing these insights to design new styles that will allow us to build upon momentum with these target consumers. Turning to kids footwear. UGG has driven impressive gains in kids categories over the past few years. We believe this is a strong indicator of brand health as purchasing patterns reflect consumers buying UGG for the family with the majority of top styles representing popular items from the men's and our women's product range. These bundled purchases are obviously great for increasing current values and wholesale open to buy but also act as a great avenue to introduce UGG to the next generation of consumers. Beyond footwear, UGG has been focused on acquiring new consumers through a compelling apparel assortment. To build awareness in the category, UGG developed it's first-ever apparel dedicated marketing campaign, which helped drive a 40% increase in apparel consumer acquisition year-to-date. Our consumers have responded particularly well to ready-to-wear sportswear and outerwear items that contain visual UGG DNA, logo treatment and deliver on the expected feeling of UGG. This was the first season for a number of retailers carrying UGG apparel, many of whom are concentrated in the youth and sports lifestyle channels. These channels have been driving strong performance with UGG footwear for sometime now. And we're excited that they are on board to expand into a head-to-toe UGG offering. On the domestic front, this is the fourth consecutive year UGG has delivered strong year-to-date growth in the U.S. where brand consideration remains at an all-time high among 18-to-34-year-old according to Hugo. The brand's development of a more youthful and diverse product assortment as well as the ongoing U.S. wholesale marketplace management strategy has helped us strategically expand within youth and sports lifestyle accounts. While UGG has built market share across its account base, the youth and sports lifestyle accounts have significantly outpaced growth with department stores. Additionally, UGG has driven significant gains in DTC acquisition with 18-to-34-year-olds over the past two years, as this age group has grown at a 25% CAGR year-to-date over the same period of fiscal 2020. Critical to this success has been the product adoption among those younger consumers who are purchasing both heritage products like the classic short and mini, but also new franchises like the Neumel, Fluff, Tasman and Classic Clear. From an international standpoint, regions outside of the U.S. have accounted for approximately half of UGG's growth this year, with EMEA and China driving the majority of gains over last year. Approximately three years ago, UGG implemented a marketplace reset strategy in the EMEA region based on the successful strategy that reignited the brand in the U.S. This involved a reduction of wholesale accounts to the tune of approximately 35% over the last three years, allocating and segmenting core product and elevating brand positioning while also working to create demand for complementary UGG products in new categories. Beyond the marketplace activities in EMEA, the UGG marketing team began localizing global content to more effectively connect with consumers living in European and Asian countries. More recently, UGG developed market-specific collaboration and brought on local influencers to help highlight the brand's compelling product. These actions have help to drive the international turnaround of UGG which is now delivering growth in high full price sell-through with the brand's most diverse product assortment effort. Importantly, the return to growth of international UGG regions aligns with our global category growth initiatives, further aiding the brand's diversification into categories outside of women's classic. Fiscal year-to-date, women's core classics and derivatives have moderated to below 40% of international revenue. This is more in line with the U.S. and compares to north of 50% just three years ago. With a tightened supply of core product, international regions are driving healthy growth with popular global styles such as the Fluff franchise, Ultra Mini, Classic Clear and the Neumel. By highlighting new categories, reducing the supply of core product and tailoring marketing campaigns to local consumers, UGG has begun to expand its audience to younger consumers in both Europe and China. In Europe, this has led to new strategic points of distribution in the youth and sports lifestyle channel. The volume generated with these retail partners is still relatively small but growing significantly faster than average. And if the U.S. is any indication, these emerging segments can be a big driver of growth and volume in the future. Similar to the U.S., we believe younger consumers are leading the UGG brand increased popularity among international markets. The brand has worked hard to create localized content that resonates with sub-35 age consumers in their respective markets. In Germany, France and the U.K., this age group is driving over 40% of traffic conversion from paid social. In China, this age group is driving DTC growth in key franchises including global styles such as left and the Classic Clear. The UGG team has a lot to be proud of with the progress it has made as the brand continues to drive global growth with a diverse assortment of in-demand product.  Looking ahead, we were excited for us to build upon this year's head-to-toe demand with a compelling new rainwear proposition that features two new styles, the [indiscernible] and the Tasman which we believe will help the brand further expand its year-round appeal to consumers around the world. We are already receiving great feedback on the sell-through of this collection of rainwear product and are excited to share more on our year-end call. Congratulations to the team on a great fall season, and we look forward to continued success this spring. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue in the third quarter was $185 million, reflecting a 30% increase versus last year and nearly double the volume of two years ago, despite dealing with stockouts and delayed inventory, HOKA performed well in the quarter, driven by global strength in the direct-to-consumer channel, which increased 52% over last year, and continued global wholesale market share gains, particularly among international regions as unit growth outpaced domestic. Fiscal year-to-date global HOKA revenue has increased 54% versus last year, reflecting strength across the brand's ecosystem of Access Point as domestic, international, wholesale and direct-to-consumer continue to drive impressive growth. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, we have seen strong global demand for HOKA year-to-date as US search interest increased 74% over the prior year, according to Google trends. New consumers visiting the European HOKA website during Q3 increased 88% over last year helping the region maintain the highest CDC growth rate thus far in fiscal 2022 and drove a more than 30% increase in conversion rate during China's Double 11 event, demonstrating improved awareness in the region. DTC continues to be a great avenue for HOKA to make connections with consumers, drive replenishment and increased category adoption as it more effectively displays the breadth of the brand's product assortment. We are actively testing and developing the HOKA consumer experience at pop-ups in the US and owned locations in China. In China, we plan to utilize strategic retail locations to continue building HOKA brand awareness as we develop the marketplace further and create a model for future wholesale partners to leverage. In the US, we have seen great engagement from consumers at pop-up locations and are exploring other select cities to test the HOKA experience. At the same time, HOKA is building the experience at DTC, the brand continues to build credibility and awareness with consumers through partnerships with strategic retailers. This spring, HOKA will be strategically expanding with key partners to satisfy incremental demand and further augment the brand's market share. We are pleased that our partners have continued to express excitement about the HOKA brand and their desire to expand further, and we look forward to continuing to grow those relationships. At the same time, we remain disciplined in our approach to steadily and sustainably building HOKA to a multibillion-dollar brand over time.  Shifting to product highlights for the third quarter. We launched the Bondi X at the beginning of October. This innovative style combines the signature cushion of a traditional Bondi with a carbon fiber plate to give athletes a more propulsive and efficient ride. The Bondi X launch drove significant traffic to hoka.com, 65% of which were first-time visitors. The style was even named one of the best running shoes according to GQ's 2021 Fitness Awards. Beyond the Bondi X, the HOKA brand is expanding consumer awareness with two of its newer franchises, the Rincon and the Mach. Both franchises were designed for an audience of consumers under 35 years old. The HOKA team strategically developed Rincon and Mach social content for platforms, possessing a higher concentration of this key demographic. As a result, the Rincon and Mach have been key catalysts for the HOKA brands accelerated acquisition of younger consumers, and these franchises are driving superb growth. On the collaboration front, HOKA partnered with global luxury brand Moncler to release a limited edition of the HOKA [indiscernible]. This was a great opportunity for HOKA build global awareness by partnering with a well-known European fashion luxury brand. The collaboration drove significant positive PR for HOKA and sold out in the first hour of availability. Collaborations like this are a great indicator of the brand's growing appeal beyond its traditional performance roots and into the space of fashion. While fashion is not a top priority for HIKA right now, we see this as an opportunity for the brand to capitalize more broadly in the future. To close HOKA, I'd like to congratulate the entire team for the brand being named Footwear News Brand of the Year. This is a fantastic accomplishment and speaks to the incredible momentum of HOKA as the brand marches closer to $1 billion in revenue and beyond. We have enormous confidence in the brand's ability to continue building share in a highly competitive marketplace. While we continue to operate in this constrained environment, we are prioritizing the fulfillment of HOKA demand, though carefully balancing stringent quality standards as the brand's growth has required adding further manufacturing capacity. Ramping production of this highly technical performance product will require some additional time, but our measured approach will ensure HOKA is built to become a long-term major player in the performance space, while delivering the quality product our consumers expect. With respect to channel performance in the third quarter, global direct-to-consumer revenue increased 13% versus the prior year and plus 42% versus two years ago. From a comparable sales perspective, direct-to-consumer increased 11% versus last year, fueled by strength in both retail stores and online. UGG and HOKA drove the majority of the year-over-year dollar volume increases, but DTC demand was robust across the portfolio. Facing bottlenecks during the UGG brand historical peak period of demand, we took specific actions that benefited UGG GDC, which included encouraging preorders on key styles to help smooth demand, carrying a broader exclusive assortment that provided the option of alternate in-stock products where there were shortages and offering the option to purchase back order products that had incoming inventory. In the constrained supply environment, we have experienced this year, our omnichannel capabilities proved advantageous in reducing the impact on the UGG brand business. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue in the third quarter increased 7% versus last year and 14% versus two years ago. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by international UGG and global HOKA with slight offset from a reduction in domestic UGG that resulted from earlier shipments of fall products as compared to the prior year. Wholesale comparisons remain unique as macro logistics pressures and bottlenecks continue to alter shipment timing as compared to historical patterns. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our third quarter financial results, status of the dynamic supply chain challenges facing our industry and our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook. Steve? Thanks, Steve. Our brands have performed exceptionally well this year, notwithstanding logistical challenges facing our industry. Fiscal year-to-date, Deckers has delivered revenue growth of 22% above last year and 37% above two years ago, while maintaining top-tier operating margins among peers. Our impressive margins have been achieved as we continue investing in the long-term future of our organization and prioritize growing the market share of our exceptional brands all while navigating headwinds related to the global pandemic and supply chain disruption. As I said at the opening, our brands are incredibly well positioned across the globe, but demand continues to outpace our current ability to supply it. And we are managing the business to deliver strong results in this uncertain environment. We have continuously evolved our strategies to mitigate the impacts of the dynamic state of the logistics environment. Key actions we are taking include tightening our product assortments to increase SKU efficiency, raising prices selectively based on assessing the competitive landscape of our brands, utilizing the strength of our balance sheet to carry increased levels of inventory in response to supply chain disruption optimizing channel mix to fulfill consumer demand and scaling production to support the growth of our brands. With the realities of the current logistics environment, we recognize that HOKA will remain in chase mode for much of the upcoming year. HOKA has tremendous runway ahead, and we will continue to provide the resources necessary to build HOKA into a major multibillion-dollar player in the performance space. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to recognize and thank our employees for how well they have managed an intense workload, especially as we all continue to deal with the added stress and struggles caused by the ongoing pandemic. We are doing our best to support our employees and their families through this difficult period of uncertainty. Thank you all for joining us today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more on the bright future of Deckers brand. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Hey, Camilo. Yes. I appreciate the question. And obviously, it's a pretty dynamic environment. 30%, as you said, we're proud of that result, considering all the challenges we had getting inventory through the bottlenecks. And obviously, we had to spend a little bit more in air freight to mitigate some of those challenges. And what we've seen, quite honestly, in the last six months is the demand for the brand has accelerated from what we thought it was going to be six months ago. And so we are in chase mode. It's a good position to be in. It's challenging in this environment. We think we'd be closer to a 50% growth rate on an annual basis. And that could be higher depending on what inventory we can get into the country and get it out to the marketplace to the consumer. But generally speaking, we're pleased with the makeup of the HOKA business globally. We're seeing great traction in the international markets. North America continues to be very strong. Strong sell-through -- and the challenge is that accelerated demand has put more pressure on the supply chain. So we've had to go secure additional sourcing partners in the Far East. And that doesn't happen overnight, obviously. So with the challenge of slowed inbound into the DC on a regular basis, bringing on new factories to be able to keep up with the increased demand over the next year and beyond. There's a lot going on there, but the bottom line is the demand is exceptional. The teams are doing everything they can to keep the brand heat going and stealing market share. And as you saw in the quarter, in the year, we're spending money to maintain the sales even at 30%. So we are air-freighting a lot of products. That's a headwind that we've absorbed this year while still delivering guidance of a healthy operating margin at the end of the year, and something we're going to continue to evaluate. But we are taking, what I would say is a more cautious, but aggressive stance on the HOKA brand and all of our brands, the goal is continuing to drive top line and steal market share where we can. And we have to pay some more in air freight and short-term to enable that growth and continue the dominant pace that HOKA has, we're comfortable doing that. And we're figuring out how do we absorb that, but still deliver top tier results, which is what we're doing and confident that we can mitigate the challenges going forward. Yes. I mean these are all what you're describing are all the levers that we get to pull in this environment. And the good news is that the strength of the brand gives us the ability to raise prices where we think we can -- and to give you a little bit more clarity on that, HOKO started raising prices in December in our Spring product and on some of the Bondi, Clifton and Rincon. And that a lot of that price increase is hitting right now in this quarter in Q1 roughly around 6% to 8% increase across the board. And the HOKA brand is continuing to look at opportunities going into fall and next spring to continue to do that to offset some of the headwinds in supply costs. From an UGG perspective, we've been raising prices strategically and surgically over the last couple of years. But we are taking a broader look at the assortment for this coming fall and you're going to see some price increases on some of our bigger styles, not the classic short, but you'll see it in Neumel and Classic Mini and other few areas where we are going to be raising prices. We have a good deal of inventory coming in for UGG, which is at the older price, the cost of making that product, which is good for us. So that helps with the logistics headwinds and then some of the price increases that we think we can put in will also help on the margin going forward. But I think I just want to make it super clear. We don't see the challenges with supply chain and the bottlenecks at the port, getting better for quite some time. And so we're taking that stance going forward that what we're experiencing now is going to continue, and we're planning the business going forward. With that in mind, until we see signs that things are opening up, but we have not seen any of those signals yet. Correct? Yes. Yes. So I think are kind of you're saying is there a shift between quarters. Remember, we haven't talked much about the quarter cadence. So we're really looking at this kind of on a full year basis. I know various models kind of had different scenarios in terms of what kind of what was projected for UGG. As we've said, largely the year is being delivered as we've said and expected from an UGG perspective. So -- as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected that there are going to be shipment timing issues between quarters, which is part of the reason that we haven't given quarterly guidance. I think earlier on, we anticipated more growth in the front half of the year. We've seen some of that drift into the back half. But I think from how we're seeing the cadence of the year from an UGG perspective, we're still on target with kind of what we've said, and we've seen the cadence of the business kind of continue as we expected. So in good shape, I think I agree with you. I think there was some concern on the performance of UGG in the quarter. I think we've demonstrated the brand has performed well, demand is still very strong and consumers are seeking the brand out. Yes. So just on the product launches, obviously, with the supply chain challenges, the brand team has had to adjust on the fly the timing of different launches based on where they can get all the inventory here and time, et cetera. It's early days in the Kawana. We're excited about what that could do from a cross-training perspective and bringing that type of running product to a unique consumer that's looking for that from us. But we'll continue to innovate and expand into different categories as we go forward, but it's early days on that style. I think from a store perspective, we're very pleased with how things have gone so far. The store in New York is far exceeding expectations, and I think that is a good signal when you have awareness of a brand that you can see strong growth the experience that we're seeing in China is good from a traffic perspective, but conversion isn't quite as high as we'd like to be yet. And so that just speaks to people getting familiar with the brand over time. It's early days in China. People are still relatively unfamiliar with the brand. But the experience that our stores are providing for the consumer there and giving confidence to our partners in the marketplace is very strong. And so we're pleased with how things are going. But a heavy lift over time to get China to where it needs to be, but we're off to a good start. And then real optimism around what a store concept could do as we expand into the US and Europe over time as well. Thanks, Laurent. Yes. DTC business for UGG was very strong. As Steve said, particularly in the back half of December. We saw a real uptick in that business, and that continues to be a solid driver for us. And just speaks to the consumers' demand for the product. If they can't find it in wholesale, where they like to shop. They're coming to our website, and we're doing our best to service them. Broadly speaking, I'm very pleased with how the UGG brand is evolving and has evolved away from the core Classics business. We're still -- we still have a robust and healthy business there. But it's much more diverse across Tazz and Ascot and Mini and Tasman and Neumel, et cetera. The Neumel is a runaway story right now. It's the number one style across men's and women's, doing incredibly well, and it's being adopted globally and in sports lifestyle channel that is really driving a lot of business. Men's is on the upside, as we've spoken about. Kids is on the upside. And then when you look at apparel, that business seasons are now starting to contribute to some of the growth -- that business is up 50% year-to-date and with still a lot of upside in that category as well. So when you think about where this brand was a few years ago to where it is now, diversified across gender and category and then head to toe and super pleased with how we're seeing the international regions evolve both in wholesale and e-commerce. So yes, we could have done more business in the quarter with UGG. If we had -- we were able to get our hands on more inventory, and that's slowly coming in Q4. But again, the brand is in a very good place, management of the assortment and the SKUs in the marketplace is very tight and very strong, full price sell-through was there, margins are healthy. A lot of reason to be optimistic for a brand of this size. Certainly not the upside on an annual growth basis that you see with HOKA, but still very strong in the context of the footwear industry. Yes. And I think at that point, we'll be able to share. I mean, we still need to make some investments in the business to sustain and afford. And from a logistics standpoint, DCs, infrastructure systems, talent, with this kind of demand and growth ahead of us, there's going to be some additional investments we'll need to make and we'll talk more about that going forward. So yes, to know that we could have done 20% this year with -- if we had taken out the air freight, makes us feel good, and I'm really proud of the team's ability to adjust this year to still deliver on our operating margin guidance. At this point, considering the fact that we had to absorb a $100 million bogey in the year. That just speaks to the flexibility of our model and the capabilities of the leadership team. That's how we're looking at it. Yes. Based on inventory. Yes. I can give you inventory by brand. I don't have the in-transit rating front of me, but roughly speaking, yes. So as I said, in total, the in-transit is just above 50%. So 50% of the $551 million is in transit. The $551 million, as it roughly breaks out by brand is about $350 million on UGG, $130 million on HOKA, $27 million on Teva, $10 million on Sanuk and a little over $26 million on Koolaburra. All right. Thanks, Sam. Cancellation. Yes. So new partners in Asia. So I think you might be referring to what I said earlier about HOKA retail stores. But the best way to think about that is partners that we have on the distributor model over in Asia. We're seeing very strong demand in those partners outside of China and Japan, we get Australia and some of the Southeast Asia countries. And then in China, what I really meant there is, over time, we will mirror the model that we've established for UGG with a handful of healthy owned retail stores and then third-party wholesale partners in region who can run stores for us. So in China, what I was speaking to is having a retail presence and showing that we are investing in the brand and creating a compelling experience for the consumer, that's all good for the distributors, potential partners that we're evaluating at the moment to see how Deckers is getting behind HOKA and gives them a lot of confidence for this brand going forward. Yes. I mean, where we're able to get inventory to our partners, again, sell-through is exceptional, both existing partners, primarily in the run specialty arena. But as we talked about before, DICK'S is continuing to see very strong success. We're continuing to slowly and strategically expand with them as a partner. And so the results and the feedback from all of our wholesale partners, aside from frustration on delivery and timing that the teams had to deal with is very strong, speaking to the product and the demand for the brand and how awareness is increasing. So all good signs there, and that's on a global level. It's just really truly a matter of keeping up the demand right now, which we see accelerating on a regular basis. Thank you. Yes. Yes, it's a good question. Weather used to be make or break for the UGG brand because we were so reliant on just kind of core products and didn't have a lot of non-weather-related options or fashionable options. So that's changed dramatically. I think weather now is -- it's either a small multi-play or up or down a few percentage points. It's probably the way to think about it. It was warmer than we expected in December, but the strength of the brand and the fashion product even though the classic still performed well, but it's really new mail, Tasman and the flood franchise that was driving the upside. And those tend to be less weather resistant for us. And as weather starting to -- or for the month of January, where weather is coal in the Northeast, we're still continuing to see strong demand for the brand. So we feel really good about the fact that we've kind of mitigated that weather impact and how important it was for our success by having a much more diverse and interesting fashionable product assortment that isn't so weather reliant. And we're going to continue to build on that for sure. And then I think if you look at the rain product that's in now, that's always been a big opportunity for us, and we have finally come to market which, I think, is a very compelling and exciting assortment in that category, we see continued upside there. And so you're going to see us build after that opportunity across men's, women's and kids as well. Yes, good question, Jim, and thanks kind of for asking because we can provide a little clarification because it is challenging in the current environment, and that is why we're being careful about it. I think -- and we got the before I think John asked just in terms of some of the components of it. We're having to use more airfreight than what we previously anticipated, your first question. And part of that is just with some of the disruption that we're seeing continued port congestion and having in-demand brands and especially with HOKA, we need to air freight that in. So that's going to be a continued kind of headwind until we start to see some normalization around the port congestion. We're not seeing any signs of that yet. So that is a bit of an unknown as to how long that will continue. So we want to be careful about what we're seeing in respect to when we can expect to see that reduce or normalize, right? So -- and I think, as I said in three months, hopefully, we're seeing some improvement, so we can give you a better update. But right now, nothing points to that. I think the other consideration and headwinds that we're dealing with as much of the inventory that we brought in this year has put a headwind pressure related to the ocean freight. So we've been inbounding inventory. The increased expense has largely impacted Q3 and beyond, right? The first two quarters were still at inventory freight levels that were at lower rates. So that will be a continued headwind for us as we go into FY 2023. And again, we'll be able to provide a better perspective on FY 2023 in three months. But those are the headwinds that we're continuing to face. As I said in the prepared remarks, we were hopeful that we would see some improvement. We're still seeing a high level, nearly twice what we saw a year ago with in-transit inventory. So with these costs still where they're at, we're still using air freight and more than what we previously anticipated, it's just really difficult in this environment to be able to give you clear guidance on what that gross margin means. And -- so how that relates to prices is because we know some of this air will reduce in time. We just don't know when. We're not pricing that into our product price increases. So we are increasing prices that are offsetting material increases. We are increasing pricing that's setting, that's helping offset some of the increase in ocean that we expect will continue, but we're not contemplating trying to offset airfreight in that. As we said in the prepared remarks, is a strategic decision on our part to get product in here to meet demand that's in the market. We want to maintain and grow market share. So that's the strategic levers that we're using and it does come at some gross margin compression, but we're willing to take that. And then as that eases off we'll be in a better position where you'll see some gross margin expansion. Yes. Yes. Good question, Jay. The need to continue to market this brand is intense. And I think just -- and it's beyond just the amount of dollars you throw at it. The partnerships are crucial. We're really proud of our Global IRONMAN partnership, and that's having an impact in all the international regions as well. We're looking to expand that where we can into other opportunities, continuing to work with our athletes, both in insights on product, but also expanding the breadth and the awareness of the brand and supporting our community around the globe. Those are all part of the things that we do on a regular basis. That's true to our brand and really important for the continued success. But over the past year, we brought in a new Head of Marketing to the brand. Norman Delaney, who is doing a great job. And she's also embarked on a project where we're looking at bringing on a global -- or we have brought on a global agency of record to take what we're doing from a marketing perspective to the next level. I think we've been very good at events and independent launches of products, but we're looking for \u2013 in this new approach going forward, a much more consistent voice and message and look and feel for the brand going forward on a global scale. So you'll see that to start to happen in Q1, Q2. We're going to be launching a new updated website with the brand and some of that new creative will start showing on that over the summer. And then we'll continue to build on that. But the regional global teams are very excited about the new partner from a marketing and agency perspective. And then I think this is going to just be another boost to the brand to have an elevated, consistent global marketing story that we can create more consistency across all the product launches and in the markets. And then we also signed on in addition to iron Mariner sponsorship of the primary sponsor of the UTMB series going forward. These are very important races in the space, have global reach and they're very -- the Pinnacle positioning for both hardcore runners, but also everyday runner and fitness enthusiasts. Thank you Jay."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Dave's remarks regarding the success of our key strategies. With three quarters of the year now behind us, including the peak UGG holiday season, we feel great about the strength of our brand portfolio. Throughout the year, UGG has driven global growth with a diverse assortment that is resonating with consumers across multiple categories, including apparel and accessories. At the same time, HOKA continues to build share with compelling performance products across its ecosystem of Access Point. The growth delivered by our two largest brands was achieved despite significant supply chain disruption, that we expect to remain a headwind for the foreseeable future. While this challenge persists, we have a great deal of confidence in the demand for our brands, bolstered by our omni-channel capabilities, flexible operating model and fortified balance sheet. Ultimately, we believe that prioritizing our long-term strategic goals will allow our brands to remain successful and drive continued market share gains. Now for the financial specifics of Q3 results. Third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue was $1.188 billion, representing a 10% increase versus last year and a 27% increase versus two years ago. Q3 growth was driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA, as international UGG increased 29% versus last year, led by a return to growth in our EMEA region and an acceleration in China. And global HOKA increased 30%, aided by a more than 50% increase in DTC. Gross margins for the third quarter were down 470 basis points versus last year to 52.3%. The decrease as compared to last year was due to higher freight costs as ocean container rates have significantly increased. Third-party delivery fees have increased, and we have used a substantial amount of air freight. The increased cost in freight, including all of these components, amounted to approximately $55 million above last year in the quarter. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $328 million, up 15% from last year's $285 million. Increased spend was primarily driven by greater marketing expense to increase localized content highlight new categories and fuel brand heat globally as well as higher warehouse expenses as we grow our logistics network and other variable expenses. Our tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which compares favorably to the 22.2% last year due to discrete tax benefits and a higher proportion of international revenue. This resulted in a diluted earnings per share of $8.42 for the quarter, which compares to $8.99 in last year's third quarter. The $0.57 decrease versus last year was primarily driven by lower gross margins that resulted from higher freight costs, higher marketing, warehouse and variable expenses with partial offsets from the revenue growth of our two largest brands and benefits from a lower tax rate and share count. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, we ended December with $998 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory, including in transit was $551 million, up 80% from $305 million at the same time last year, with the large majority of that increase still in transit and delayed due to port congestion. And we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $131 million worth of shares at an average price of $369.12. Fiscal year-to-date through December, we have repurchased approximately 736,000 shares, spending a total of $267 million. At December 31, 2021, the company still had $544 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before we move into our final outlook update for fiscal year 2022, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our logistics network and the actions we are taking to mitigate future effects on our business. The most material challenge facing our business continues to be prolonged transit times for items produced overseas to reach our warehouses. This has led to a much higher proportion of inventory classified as in transit. At September quarter end, we noted that approximately 45% of inventory was in transit, which compared to roughly 20% in the prior year at the same point in time. As of December 31, we have not seen improvement as approximately 50% of our inventory remained in transit, which compares to roughly 25% in the prior year at 12/31. We do not expect this issue to be resolved near-term. And as a result, we plan to carry elevated levels of inventory at fiscal 2022 year end and into fiscal year 2023, placing an emphasis on receiving product into the country of sale at the expense of inventory efficiencies in the short-term. We will continue to utilize airfreight where strategically necessary to import products and leapfrog port congestion to maintain share. More specifically, with the rate of growth our brands are experiencing, particularly HOKA, which has more consistent demand throughout the year as well as a greater percentage of at-once business. Aligning sufficient inventory levels with elevated demand has become increasingly difficult. To help offset this issue, we have stepped up our airfreight usage to supplement ocean and port delays, but shipping by air is causing gross margin compression. Our strategy is to prioritize HOKA market share in the ultra competitive performance footwear space. And as such, we are willing to maintain higher air freight usage to fulfill this demand. Meanwhile, the HOKA team is actively working through product launch adjustments to best align with the current logistics environment. On pricing, we spoke last quarter about raising prices on select HOKA styles this spring and taking a look at UGG for the fall of 2022 season. Our product teams have completed a thorough review of their respective brand, price elasticity and are continuing to adjust prices on target styles accordingly. While these changes can help offset some of the inflationary pressures on materials, we still expect elevated freight expense to be a near-term headwind above these pricing adjustments. Please note this does not constitute gross margin guidance for next year as pricing and freight are only a few of the many variables that factor into our gross margin forecast. From a factory production standpoint, we maintain a network of strategic third-party manufacturers and have been actively seeking additional production lines with existing and potential new partners. Despite ongoing activities, we expect some of our growth in the upcoming fiscal year to be limited by manufacturing capacity constraints to ensure product quality and integrity, particularly with HOKA, given the complex nature of the brand's high-performance products, it will take time to ramp-up additional production. These efforts are made more difficult by the existence of the ongoing pandemic. We will provide a more thorough update on our fiscal year 2023 expectations during our year end call in May. Now with that context in mind, and moving to guidance for the full fiscal year 2022 and on revenue, we are narrowing our range to reflect a $20 million increase on the low end and maintaining the high end of our prior guidance, now expecting a range of $3.03 billion to $3.06 billion. This represents growth of approximately 19% to 20% over fiscal year 2021. Gross margin is now expected to be at or slightly below 51.5%. Included in this is our annual spend on freight that is now projected to be $100 million over last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue, and we expect our operating margin to land within the prior range at approximately 17.5% of revenue. We now expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5% for the year. And taking these into account, we are narrowing our prior earnings per share expectation to a range of $14.50 to $15.15 for full fiscal year 2022. At this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate additional significant supply chain disruption beyond what we have covered here today excludes onetime charges and does not contemplate impact from additional share repurchases. We look forward to providing additional updates on next year during our fourth quarter call in May. Thanks, everyone. And I will now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yes. Camilo, this is Steve. Just to add to that. You mentioned increasing price to offset. On air, we're not necessarily seeing or looking to offset the air in. So the increases that we have are offsetting material inflation and ocean freight, but we see air more as transitory -- at what point does that get better, we're not certain, but we won't be able to completely offset the air increase. Yes. And I would add, if your question was, do we see inventory delivery shift from Q4 into Q3? No, because we were chasing inventory, the majority of the quarter. There was some shift of Q3 in Q2 that we contemplated on the year-to-date results. But I think what's important on the quarter for UGG is just to understand where the growth came from. And a lot of the growth came from international regions, which is something we've been working on in transforming those marketplaces to a younger, more diverse audience and diverse product offering, consolidating wholesale accounts in Europe, the marketplace and attracting and having success with a younger consumer. -- with new product franchises such as the Fluff and the Classic Clear and the Tasman. So I'm excited about the fact that it's right on strategy, what we've been working on in those regions for the past few years. We're starting to see the results of that. It's very exciting. And it just shows the strength and the global appeal of this brand and the fashion product that we're putting into the assortment. Yes. And then -- this is Steve, Laurent. Just on the DTC mix, I think what you'll see in the quarter is we had strong DTC performance and it was especially strong in December. So we benefited with some short supply out in the wholesale channel, consumers coming directly to us. And I think that starts to demonstrate the strength of our DTC and omni capabilities, not necessarily representative of where the mix will be on a full year basis as it's stronger in this quarter, but a good demonstration of the progress that we're making on that front. Yes. Thanks, Jon. It's a good question. And clearly, it's something that we're looking at. We, again, haven't given guidance, but I think the way you're looking at it is right in terms of what the impact is. Now we did in the current year, cut back in other areas. So those are probably things we wouldn't necessarily cut back in a normal year. So you're right in terms of the $100 million, if you add that back, you get to kind of a 20%. But we have course corrected during the year and not spent as much on some other areas of the business that we typically would. So I would say stay tuned, we'll be able to give you a better picture of what that looks like. And then the other thing is it's just trying to determine when all this begins to normalize. I think a big component of the $100 million, it's clearly air freight. We're hopeful that things begin to normalize, and so we wouldn't have to use as much air freight in the future. But still, there's factory disruption, there's still port congestion. And with a brand like HOKA, we're having to use more air than what we even anticipated kind of three months ago. So that's something that we're still watching. I think the other thing just to be aware of is the increase in ocean freight. And so I think that's going to take a lot longer than the air to begin to normalize. So we'll see how all that shakes out. I think we're going to learn more in the next three months, and we'll be able to give you a better perspective of what that looks like in a couple of months on the year-end call. Yes. And then just the guidance by brand, Sam, this is Steve. Really not a significant change. We've held the top end of the range. So feel comfortable with what we've given before. We've lowered the -- we -- sorry, increased the bottom end of the range. You can attribute that largely to some improvement in the UGG Q3 performance. So there, again, ranges consistent with what we guided to before and pretty consistent with what we said last time as well. And then \u2013 yes, sorry. Yes. So merch margins, I mean, generally speaking, the work that the teams are doing is to absorb additional costs that we're starting to see whether those materials or labor embedded into the product cost. So I would say that the margin upside is -- any upside that we see will come in price increases. The regular work that we're doing on merchandise margins is really to maintain the level of margins that we have now versus finding efficiencies and opportunities to increase margin in this environment. And we're taking a long-term view of this. As I said, we're reducing SKU counts. We're being more focused, and we're investing in and eliminating unnecessary products in the line and trying to make more -- this more efficient, but it's really maintaining margins at this point versus looking for upside in this challenging environment. Sure. What was... Sorry, I'll start with cancellations. Okay, this is Steve. So we're not seeing significant cancellations. I think to the point you made, we're seeing kind of what we -- are lower than what we expected in terms of cancellation. So there -- as the brands continue to remain in demand continue to sell customers are happy to get product. So we're not seeing anything that we didn't expect. So I think from a cancellation perspective, everything is as we anticipated. And the second question was... That is. Yes. So in I think you've asked the question a couple of quarters ago. So yes, in terms of -- we have stepped up the incremental amount. The full year is $100 million for all of freight. So not only the additional air freight, but inclusive of the increased rates related to ocean freight. That's correct. Correct. Yes."

Deckers delivered another quarter of strong top-line growth made further progress towards key strategies and continued investing to support long-term growth opportunities. Second quarter revenue of $722 million represents an increase of 16% versus the prior year and 33% over the second quarter, two years ago.  Steve will provide additional second quarter context later in the call. But for now, I'd like to highlight the strength of our first half as we build towards delivering an exceptional fiscal year 2022. Six months into this fiscal year, Deckers has driven revenue growth of 35% over last year and earnings per share of $5.37 compared to $3.30 in the previous year. Performance in the first half exemplified the execution of key strategies as HOKA achieved exceptional global growth, delivering back-to-back quarters above $200 million contributing 35% of total revenue, up from 28% last year. And UGG continued to diversify its product portfolio growing double digits across Men's, Kids', and noncore Women's footwear as well as apparel and accessories further establishing itself as a globally relevant lifestyle brand. The increasing global footprint of HOKA, as well as the UGG brand's expansion beyond women's footwear are driving factors of Deckers evolution to a portfolio of powerful lifestyle brands. While we are building towards a bright future, Deckers is not immune to growing pains and global logistics pressures. Like everyone else we have been experiencing logistics bottlenecks that have led to large volumes of our product in transit as of September 30, but currently view ourselves as less vulnerable than others due to our lower exposure to Southern Vietnam production. Our bottlenecks are largely related to import congestion, which has primarily affected the UGG brand as the second quarter historically represents peak levels of fall product arriving from overseas factories. While we successfully shifted more UGG shipments into the first half in response to anticipated logistic issues, we experienced significant delays in containers being processed and released at the ports during the second quarter. We are working diligently with our logistics partners to process these shipments and we'll continue to do so. Steve will provide more details on the global logistical challenges we're experiencing and the actions we've taken to mitigate our risks later in the call. As we navigate through these challenges is we will leverage our omnichannel organization to ensure our brands are getting in front of target consumers with every opportunity to gain a share of closet with a prioritization of high quality, full price sales. Moving to the brand highlights, Global UGG second quarter revenue increased 8% versus last year to $448 million. Performance was driven by the brand's diversified product assortment, reflecting a growing penetration of men's, kids' and non-core women's footwear, as well as growth in apparel and accessories. Direct-to-consumer mix remains well above pre pandemic levels. However, the second quarter still primarily reflected fall product selling to UGG wholesale accounts. As you may recall, sell through of UGG products during last year's fall season was robust, which resulted in depleted marketplace inventories. This provided the opportunity for UGG to leverage its marketplace management strategy and reset wholesale inventories with its most diverse product assortment to date. One of the key drivers of UGG product diversification and acquisition of new and younger consumers has been the brand's fluff franchise. Fluff has been a leading element of brand diversification in the us over the past few years. The UGG product team has continued to infuse excitement and newness into the franchise with additional font colors and patterns of the original Fluff Yeah, which remained the number one DDC acquisition style in Q2, and new outdoor versions, such as the Oh Fluffita and Disco Slide. We're excited to see the franchise begin to resonate internationally as well with over 40% of franchise growth being generated outside of the U.S. in the second quarter. Another area of strength this year has been men's footwear, which increased revenue north of 20% in the second quarter. We have been encouraged by the steady increase in consumer adoption of the men's product line as we invest to build awareness and consideration among male consumers. Development of the UGG Men's business is most prevalent in the U.S. where the brand continues to drive record high levels of consideration among 18- to 34-year-olds with popular products, such as the Tasman, logo versions of the Scuff and colorful versions of the Neumel.  The Tasman, in particular, with its hybrid slipper sneaker attributes is evolving into a very popular style, experiencing considerable growth and helping to make a UGG a brand for the whole family. During the second quarter, the Tasman was a top five style with newly acquired male and female consumers. With its increased adoption and relevance among younger consumers, the UGG team introduced a companion style to the Tasman known as the Tazz. As a platform version of the Tasman, the Tazz is already gaining the attention of consumers and was recently pictured on several high-profile models attending New York Fashion Week. Beyond footwear, the UUG brand is entering its second fall season with its expanded, Ready to Wear apparel collection. The team has done a fantastic job, designing an apparel assortment featuring Cozy Fleece, Sherpa, Full Fur, and Sherling wardrobe items at compelling price points that offer value to the UUG consumer. In support of our commitment to building the lifestyle appeal bug this September, the brand launched its first ever apparel dedicated marketing campaign and influencer program to drive category awareness. The campaign is already generated over $500 million press impressions, including coverage on UGG and in style. In addition to the brand\u2019s strategic category marketing investments, UGG is expecting to further enhance its apparel accessories relevance with the second and third product drops of the Telfar collaboration. These upcoming product drops feature hats, hoodies, robes, and other exciting products. These items will be featured online as well as that self-regist pop-up shop in the United Kingdom, which speaks to the UGG brand successful repositioning and increased adoption in Europe, as well as greater acceptance of UGG as a head-to-toe brand. UGG is making great headway attracting new consumers in a EMEA as just under half of the brand second quarter online purchases were new to the brand. Key styles driving consumer acquisition in the region were the Classic Mini, Classic Clear and the men\u2019s Ascot. Moving on to China. I\u2019m pleased report that UGG is making excellent progress as the region posted the highest growth rate across the globe during the second quarter. Beyond significant revenue growth, UGG is experiencing success on a number of fronts in China, including launching a second regional specific collaboration with designer Feng Chen Wang, which is helping UGG reconnect with the Chinese fashion consumer using a broader and more inclusive community of influencers to create a greater frequency of consumer touch points. Building the DTC business by driving increased traffic and conversion at stores and generating consumer excitement with bold new product offerings, including key styles such as the Classic Clear, Ultra Mini and the Oh Fluffita. Looking towards the second half of fiscal 2022 for UGG, we expect to drive sell through with the brand\u2019s diversified product assortment, both with our wholesale partners and through our direct-to-consumer channels. We have confidence in the continued strong demand for the UGG brand and are actively working to mitigate macro supply chain challenges to deliver peak holiday season sales. Lastly, on the UGG front, you may have seen a recent release that UGG brand President, Andrea O\u2019Donnell left the company to pursue a tremendous career opportunity, and we wish her, her the best. Fortunately, we have a strong UGG team in place, which was recently bolstered by the addition of two Vice Presidents that will be leading the marketing and women\u2019s product teams. While we identify a new permanent leader for the brand, I\u2019m excited to be overseeing the talented UGG team and build on their establishment of UGG as a global leading lifestyle brand. That creates bold, exciting and luxurious products for passionate consumers. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue in the second quarter increased 47% versus last year to $210 million. The HOKA ecosystem continues to experience exceptionally balanced growth across the brand\u2019s global points of distribution and portfolio of products. HOKA has maintained a strategic and thoughtful approach to distribution management. Our goal is to build an audience of consumers through authentic performance driven product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing, and a premium consumer experience across all the brands access points. The brand continues its highly selective approach to distribution expansion and remains focused on building market share through avenues that have the resources to educate consumers on the benefits and differentiators of HOKA. With that in mind and a focus on increasing brand awareness and key markets, HOKA recently opened pop-up retail stores in New York, in Los Angeles, as well as the brands first owned and operated stores in China. The HOKA retail strategy is in the infancy stage. The brand is testing multiple strategies and learning from our results and feedback to provide the ultimate consumer experience, which currently features community events and workshops designed to bring HOKA consumers together. Though too soon to make any definitive statements on HOKA stores, we have been very pleased with the initial response from a foot traffic, sales and service perspective. HOKA is already benefiting from Deckers organizational retail expertise developed in connection with the UGG brand. This wealth of experience is proving valuable in the early days of establishing HOKA store operations and highlighting the synergies gained by operating a portfolio of brands. Once we land on the optimum consumer experience and concept for HOKA stores will look to open additional locations in China first to serve that model brand market and then begin exploring longer-term opportunities in North America and Europe. A key piece of our long-term retail strategy is a development of a compelling apparel product line that can provide a broader consumer experience at our HOKA stores. Conversion to apparel purchasing is proving to be more successful in our stores than online. As HOKA has sold a higher percentage of apparel at retail compared to e-commerce since the stores have opened. While we are still very early in developing the HOKA apparel strategy and product line, we are actively building an exceptional team to support this phenomenal brand\u2019s long-term opportunities, so stay tuned. On the digital front, HOKA was able to grow its consumer audience through a 97% increase in global acquisition online during the quarter. The brand has been prioritizing digital marketing avenues that target 18- to 34-year-old consumers. As a result, HOKA DTC acquisitions significantly over indexes toward these younger consumers. We are pleased to see that the younger consumers are adopting the HOKA brand both through its heritage Clifton and Bondi styles, as well as through newer styles aimed at the demographic such as the Mach 4 and the Rincon 3. From an international perspective, DTC remains a much smaller proportion of the business, but HOKA is scaling its DTC mix very quickly, as DTC growth is significantly outpacing wholesale. Considerable gains and consumer acquisition and retention in the UK and Germany, two of the HOKA brands key focus markets are driving the exceptional growth rate of EMEA DTC. The EMEA region continues to be the HOKA brand\u2019s largest international region. Worldwide HOKA is gaining momentum. And through the first half of this year, every global region has posted double-digit growth as compared to last year. I also want to highlight the HOKA brand\u2019s recent announcement of a multi-year sponsorship for the UTMB World Series. The Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc or UTMB for short is the world\u2019s ultimate running trail circuit, which includes over 20 events on six continents in 2022. Sponsoring the UTMB as the premier technical footwear and apparel partner is a big marketing and promotional opportunity for HOKA. We will leverage this partnership to build awareness of the brand\u2019s globally relevant performance driven products, a big thank you to the HOKA marketing team for making this sponsorship a reality. Heading into the final months of 2021, the HOKA team has been reviewing consumer insights, market research and product launch calendar for spring 2022 and input cost pressures to determine if there are strategic actions, we can take to navigate this dynamic environment. As we\u2019ve done with our other brands, HOKA has identified specific products for which there is opportunity to increase price to in better align with competitive offerings, partially offset macro input cost pressures, and maintain the brand\u2019s premium positioning and relative margin strength versus peers. The HOKA team also continues to review planned product launch dates and will make strategic adjustments to ensure healthy full price sell through of existing and future models just has the brand has done in the past. HOKA is well-positioned to gain greater market share globally as the brand expands consumer awareness through strategic marketing activations, including event sponsorships, pop-up retail, digital targeting, and forthcoming brand campaigns. Congratulations to the entire HOKA team on another stellar quarter. We look forward to continued brand execution for the second half of fiscal year 2022 and beyond, as HOKA builds to a multi-billion-dollar leader in the performance lifestyle space. With respect to channel performance in the second quarter, global wholesale revenue increased 21% versus prior year and plus 23% versus two years ago. Wholesale comparisons continue to be unique as we\u2019re lapping some disruption in the prior year and currently facing macro logistics pressures and bottlenecks that have altered shipment timing as compared to historical patterns. UGG and HOKA drove wholesale growth as UGG is refilling depleted marketplace inventories, while gaining incremental volume in new categories and HOKA continues to gain market share globally. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, global revenue increased 3% versus last year and plus 79% versus two years ago. HOKA drove the majority of DTC growth as UGG remained pressured by exceptional demand last year that resulted from pandemic tailwinds, benefiting the brand online. Line while UGG DTC declined as compared to last year, the brand is still plus 37% above pre-pandemic second quarter DTC volume. HOKA DTC increased 81% versus last year, which is on top of the prior year\u2019s triple digit increase, reflecting the brand\u2019s consumer acquisition gains in greater repeat purchasing from existing consumers. Before handing off to Steve, I want to take a moment to recognize our company, brands and employees, recent activities on the sustainability ESG and DEI fronts, which we believe are a positive contributor to our company culture, local communities, and consumer passions for our brand. A few key highlights from our recent achievements, include UGG introducing its icon impact collection, which was thoughtfully designed using low impact materials in combination with offsets to make the collection carbon neutral. Teva launching the ReEmber collection that features 100% recycled ripstop upper material. All of our brands reducing their per pair emissions in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and our employees around the globe participating in another art of kindness week, during which we collectively donated over 4,300 hours contributing to 317 organizations around the world. A big thanks to our employees for their continued dedication to giving back. Additionally, I\u2019m excited to announce that our 2021 corporate responsibility report will be released next week. The report contains a great deal of information on Deckers corporate social responsibility journey, including the filing and approval of science-based targets and the setting of robust carbon reduction targets. I\u2019d encourage you all to take a look, as this report, highlights the passion and commitment of our company and our employees to do good and do great. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our second quarter financial results, status of the dynamic supply chain challenges the industry is facing, as well as our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re excited by the demand. Our brands continue to exhibit through the first half of this fiscal year. As Dave covered, UGG is setting up the holiday season with its most diverse product assortment today. And HOKA is delivering exceptionally balanced, strong growth and market share gains across regions, channels and categories. While the supply chain remains a headwind to overcome. The performance of our brands thus far is the result of our team\u2019s dedication to executing Deckers long term strategies, as we manage through near-term disruption. The strength of our brand portfolio, our flexible operating model and robust balance sheet gives us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate the evolving marketplace. Now let me get into the second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue was $722 million, representing a 16% increase versus last year and a 33% increase versus two years ago. Q2 growth versus last year was driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA. As UGG wholesale increased 19% versus last year, as we ship more product into the channel, though, we did experience pressures from port delays and HOKA continued to deliver and press of growth across all channels with an increase of 47%. Gross margins for the second quarter were down 30 basis points versus last year to 50.9%. The decreases compared to last year was related to increased usage of air freight for the UGG wholesale brands and higher than prior year proportion of wholesale shipments. As we refill marketplace inventories and lap disruption from the prior year. With positive offsets coming from favorable brand mix, as HOKA continues to increase as a percentage of total company sales, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and fewer closeouts at a higher margin rate. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $239 million up 25% from last year\u2019s 190 million, higher spend was primarily driven by greater marketing expense to fuel brand heat, highlight new categories and increased localized content, increased compensation costs as we onboard new talent to support our growing organization and higher variable expenses related to increased volume for our warehouse logistics and IT. Our tax rate was 20.1%, which compares to 20.6% last year. This all resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.66 per the quarter, which compares to $3.58 in last year\u2019s second quarter. The $0.08 increase versus last year was primarily driven by revenue growth of the UGG and HOKA brands with offsets from increased SG&A spend primarily related to increased marketing and headcount supporting the growth of the business. Turning to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2021, we ended September with $746 million of cash and equivalent. Inventory, including units in-transit with $636 million, up 31% from $484 at the same time last year and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $54 million worth of shares at an average price of $406. That brings the year-to-date total share purchase as of September 30 to $136 million at an average share price of $356.08. And as of September 30, 2021, the company had $675 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before discussing our updated outlook for fiscal year 2022, I\u2019d like to provide some context on the current state of our supply chain, our disruption mitigation efforts and trends we are seeing. Starting with footwear production. I can confirm the majority of our products are produced in Vietnam. However, due to the location of our factories, which are primarily in Northern Vietnam, as well as the seasonality of our business and strategic product prioritization. We do not expect factory shutdowns that occurred in the second quarter to cause a material negative top line effect on our full year fiscal 2022 guidance. To put this in perspective, less than 10% of our Vietnam production today is done in the Southern region, which experienced shutdowns during the second quarter. However, our team successfully shifted a material portion of this production to alternative existing partner factories by leveraging our dual sourcing strategy, which allows us to manufacture same styles in multiple factories. While we were able to nimbly shift production locations, the expected timing of these receipts will be later than we previously planned, those still expected within the current year. As part of our ongoing sourcing strategy to support the growth of our brands and in an effort to further mitigate impacts into fiscal year 2023, we have secured additional production lines in new geographic locations with our existing partners and have also on-boarded long-term strategic factory partners. In addition, we plan to carry more inventory this year and into next year as we do not anticipate any near-term resolution to the global supply chain disruption, and it will also act as a hedge to inflationary pressures expected in FY23. From a logistics standpoint, we are not unique in that we are deal with significant delays at ports related to not only prolonged processing times for ship cargo, but also a shortage of trucks, chassis, and drivers. While the challenges at the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been widely reported, the issue is not isolated to those ports and port constraints have postponed shipments to our warehouses in Q2. In a typical year roughly 20% of inventory is in transit at the end of September. But this year with the bottlenecks that we've experienced, approximately 45% of our inventory was in transit. Even with product beginning to move off the water, as well as packed and staged at the warehouse. Some of our wholesale partners are experiencing labor shortages and logistic constraints in their own operations, which is further hindering our ability to deliver shipments in a timely manner. Additionally, on the international front we've experienced numerous startup challenges during our 3PL distribution center transition in Europe and expect there will be continued pressures as they refine their systems and delivery levels. While the transition has been difficult, especially in light of the challenging global logistics environment, this is a critical investment to create long-term capacity that will facilitate anticipated growth in the UGG and HOKA brands for years to come. We will continue to work closely with our provider to assist with improving throughput as their operations come up to speed. From a freight expense standpoint, the entire industry continues to face higher costs for ocean containers. In addition, as production and port delays persist on top of delays arising from production shifts in Vietnam, we will continue to utilize elevated levels of air freight, which is considerably more expensive whenever it is needed to maintain strategic product launches. As Dave mentioned, the HOKA brand is implementing targeted price increases for specific products, which will help partially offset higher air freight costs, but we will still expect, there will be some level of gross margin compression. As with the rest of our peers and industry we're dealing with a number of challenges, but I have the utmost confidence in our employees and their resilience to overcome these hurdles. With that context in mind, we are adjusting our outlook to reflect these supply side risks. For the full fiscal year 2022 we are reiterating our expected top line revenue growth of 18% to 20%, which equates to revenue in the range of $3.01 billion to $3.06 billion, including expectations of HOKA growing 50-plus percent over last year with confidence the brand can include $875 million of revenue. UGG growing high single digits, reflecting pressure on the prior high end of the range due to shipment disruption, Teva's still growing in the high-teens range and Koolaburra and Sanuk expected to be approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is now expected to approximately 51.5%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to further pressures from increasing costs related to ocean containers and greater utilization of air freight as port congestion and trucking scarcity has worsened. SG&A is now expected to be approximately 34% of revenue reflecting our operating models, agility in this dynamic environment to flex our variable spend with targeted temporary reductions. We anticipate these expense adjustments will help offset further gross margin pressure allowing us to maintain the prior high end of our operating margin range at 18%. We are lowering the bottom end of the operating margin to 17% to reflect current port congestion conditions that may necessitate more air freight. We still expect a tax rate of approximately 23%. Taking into account the risk factors I have mentioned along with the share repurchase executed in the second quarter, we are expanding our earnings per share guidance range for fiscal year 2022 to now be in the range of $14.15 to $15.15. While we have tried to incorporate what we know at this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate any further significant supply chain disruption excludes one-time charges and does not contemplate impact from additional share purchases. Although supply chain pressures have grown across the entire industry. We remain confident in maintaining our prior top line revenue guidance as our brands continue to experience exceptional marketplace demand. Actions our teams have taken to preserve this outlook include bringing greater levels of inventory earlier to mitigate delays and inflationary cost pressures. Utilizing our dual sourcing network to offset factory closures and disruption, adding production capacity and further diversifying our country level exposure of factories and partners, increasing air freight usage to ensure our brands are opportunistically gaining market share in this competitive environment, strategically evaluating and leveraging our brands, price, elasticity and remaining nimble in responding to new challenges as they arise. A combination of these efforts has enabled us to maintain the top end of our operating margin outlook, while expanding the range of our earnings guidance to reflect the current challenges of the supply chain environment. Deckers continues to deliver strong growth with excellent levels of profitability and is operating from a position of strength. Thanks everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks Steve. The company's performance over the past six months highlights the strength of our brand portfolio and value of our operating model. Our largest brands, UGG and HOKA are delivering compelling growth in the midst of historic levels of supply chain disruption. In spite of this turmoil, the company continues to generate strong cash flow that enables our leadership team to continue making key strategic investments that will contribute to Deckers long-term growth and success. Our focus remains to increase global awareness and adoption of HOKA as we work towards building a powerful multi-billion-dollar performance brand, build the global adoption of UGG across a diverse set of consumers, categories, seasons and regions, and acquire consumers direct into our ecosystem with the goal of scaling our DTC mix of business to 50% of revenue over time. We are proud of our employees continued progress on these key initiatives and appreciate their buy-in to make our collective organizational success a reality. In the last 18 plus months, which are unprecedented in modern history, our employees have proven the value of our collaborative and winning culture. This reflects in both our financial performance, but also in the progress we continue to make on the ESG and DEI fronts. I'm delighted to share that the culture of Deckers is being recognized outside of our organization as well. Earlier this month, Deckers was ranked six on Newsweek's list of the 100 most loved workplaces. On behalf of the board and the management team I am extremely proud of this distinction as we continue to live our values by fostering a positive environment that allows employees to come as you are. Recognition like this matters a great deal, especially when we are building our workforce for the future. For more on our global efforts supporting Deckers culture and values, I would want again encourage everyone to take a look at our 2021 corporate responsibility report that will be released next week. I'd like to thank you all for joining us here today and to thank all of our stakeholder for your continued support. We look forward to sharing Deckers continued bright future with you. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon, everyone. And definitely tricky navigating everything, it seems like you're moving through it. As you think about the navigation of this supply chain headwinds, and you mentioned the percentage of goods in transit was 45% at the end of September. What does that cadence look like going forward? How do you see that developing? And how much is pressure from the wholesale partners impacting your inventory levels and getting goods? Then I just have a follow up.\nSteve Fasching: Sure. Dana, this is Steve. I'll take a first stab and then Dave can jump in. I think in terms of cadence, how we're looking at is, as we've said in the script, we're going to be buying more inventory this year because, while we don't know exact timing and we're focused on the year. We do want to make sure that we have goods in place to sell. So, as we see it, our ending position at Q2 we had about the same amount of inventory in the way warehouse a year ago, even though we had that in 30% increase. So, we're going to continue to process that inventory. There is a bit of a domino effect that the delays are going to impact other inbound inventory. So, we're very focused on processing what we can through the port congestion. We will supplement it with air freight were appropriate, especially around product launches. And so, we're going to continue to do that. I think the strategy of buying more inventory early on at the beginning of this year was the right strategy. And so, the inventory's not the issue. Demand is not the issue. It's just our ability to process inventory work through, port congestion, and as we said trucks and chassis, as well as working with our wholesale customers to get them to pick it up because they're experiencing similar challenges with arranging trucks and drivers. So overall would've liked to have done more, but we're dealing with what we have and I think we've good a good strategy to approach it.\nDave Powers: Yes. I would echo that, and I think as Steve said, we were proactive in getting ahead of this with increasing our production at the end of last year, going into the beginning of this year. Making sure we had plenty of goods to sell, knowing that prices are going to go up and that the supply chain challenges could persist. That's proven to be true. The good news is the inventories on its way. We have a large number on the water in transit. And we feel confident that we'll have the inventory particularly as it relates to UGG in Q3 in the marketplace, going into peak season, whether that's at wholesaler or DTC, we'll be prepared for the busy season of UGG. And then the other, the next piece of that is just preparing for Q4 for UGG, but also really HOKA when this starts ripping up. So, if the day-by-day navigation of when it's going to be here? How it's going to get here, but we have incredible relationships with our factory partners. We have incredible relationships with our wholesale partners and we're all in this together to get to the inventory out to the consumer's passes and best positioned as we can.\nDana Telsey: Thank you. And then pricing?\nSteve Fasching: The follow-up.\nDana Telsey: Yes. The follow-up is about pricing. Are you taking price on HOKA and UGG and if so, how much, how do you see that evolving?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So, we didn't do a lot of price increases, generally speaking for this current fall. HOKA has taken prices up surgically, I would say with their big styles starting in spring introductions and that's embedded in the guidance. And then for fall 2022, we will be taking prices up for the UGG brand. And I'm confident that based on the strength of the brand and the consumer sentiment in the market, we have the ability to do that. And fortunately, a lot of the inventory that we have coming in the pipeline is on a lower cost basis than it will be next year. So that works to our advantage, but we will be taking price increases going into FY23, starting in the fall with UGG.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Hi. Thank you. First question, just on the UGG, the update to the UGG sales guidance for the year in bringing down the top end. Can you maybe just comment how that looks across channels wholesale versus D to C. And you're not looking for guidance into next year, but how long do you expect some of these challenges to continue as we think into next year?\nDave Powers: Yes. I\u2019ll let Steve answer that. The challenges with UGG really, it's not a demand challenge at all. We still have very strong demand from our consumer and our wholesaler accounts are telling us that they generally speaking still wanted the product. So, it's more about the ability for us to product out of the distribution network due to the bottlenecks in Q2, but the demand is very strong. So, it's just a matter of getting caught up. With Steve you detailed...\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think Jon, yes, in terms of the guidance, how we're looking at UGG, we shaved a little off the top end and I think that has to do, as we said around the disruption that we're seeing and the port congestion, so inability to get some product on time, we think is going to put some pressure on our ability to sell to that high end. That's going to be, I think equally felt as we look at it now. The dynamics that we don't know yet is really how the selling season plays out. So, assuming things improve from where we were at the end of Q2, and we were able to get more product to process through our warehouse we'll be able to process those wholesale orders. Again, then depending on what happens there we'll determine how we handle DTC business. So, we could see an increase in our DTC business with improvement and product, but that'll be dependent to on how much honestly, we ship really in the next kind of month and a half. So hard to say kind of how the channels work out, but we're going to be prepared that if there is some disruption to shipping in our wholesale customers, we'll pick that up through our DTC channels. So, we're remaining pretty flexible on that, hard to say exactly how that plays out. Just a little bit of caution because of the disruption that we've seen, again the domino effective of when that's going to, and how that's going to play out, but we will be you prepared to pick up any of those wholesale sales that may get missed with our own DTC business.\nDave Powers: Yes. We saw that last year when there was scarcity in the marketplace for wholesale, we saw consumers going direct to our DTC channels, mostly our website at the time, hence the challenge on the comp this year in that channel. But I think as I said, going into November, December, we have the inventory and we'll be ready depending on how the consumer wants to shop.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. That's very helpful. And then one follow-up on gross margin, the full year outlook, the change is that all related to freight? And could you may be further quantify what you are embedding now? And then when we look at the implied second half gross and it looks maybe 150 basis points or more below the second half of fiscal 2020. So just want to maybe ask how you're thinking about the pricing that you are planning, how that might offset the expected inflation and what's the right way to think about the baseline for gross and going forward?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, sure Jon. So, before we got into just under, I think, 53, we're now about 51.5, that difference is really increased ocean freight as well as more air freight. And so, if you look at the first half of the year, the first half of the year, a lot of that inventory was transported before we're seeing the increases around ocean freight. So, we're anticipating a much bigger hit in the second half related to ocean freight increases. So, the inventory that's in transit and flowing in now is coming in at a higher freight cost, then also supplementing it with more air freight that we expect to experience in the second half. So, the price increases that we're implementing with HOKA will help offset, but it's still relatively small in the big scheme of things.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. \nSteve Fasching: So yes, it's able to help mitigate it to a very small extent and that less than 150 basis point margin hit on the year that we're now projecting is really ocean freight increases largely that we expect to experience in the second half, as well as some supplemental air freight that we did do and will do more of in the second half.\nDave Powers: Yes. And we've taken a conservative approach on it. So, it could improve, but right now, from where we stand today, calling the ball, this is what we think is prudent.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. And just to clarify your pricing strategy throughout next year, is it \u2013 do you think it's enough to trend more back towards your 2021 levels of gross margin or should we be thinking back towards 2020 more sort of the baseline going forward?\nSteve Fasching: That's the goal is to get it back. And so, the price increases discussions that we're having in the brand are pretty broad based, including some kind of core classics in the mix still early days, but that's how we're thinking about it, get back to normalized levels.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I think Jon on that early to tell, right, and it's going to be dependent on when we begin to see normalized freight around containers. So, what we're experiencing this year, hopefully we aren't going to necessarily see on an ongoing basis. So, the sooner we can get back to a more normalized level that will be tailwind on the margin front. And then on the air freight, additionally, with the extra inventory that we're are bringing in this year should provide a tailwind for us. But I want to be a little careful about getting too far ahead of ourselves on how much margin takeback we get next year.\nSteve Fasching: Yes.\nJonathan Komp: Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks. Okay.\nSteve Fasching: Okay.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: The next question comes from Camilo Lyon from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a clarifying question first on the Q2 revenue number that you reported, it looks from our math that you had about $75 million to$100 million of that delay in shipments. Is that about the right ballpark to think about out in terms of what you experienced from a supply chain transit perspective?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think again, we're looking at the whole year, haven't given guidance, but if you look at what we were expecting in terms of inbound inventory that remained in transit yes, you're right in terms of how much you could probably extrapolate of what we thought we could have turned on that inbound inventory. That got really hung up in transit during the quarter.\nCamilo Lyon: Okay, great. And then I guess the question is it sounds like that's still in transit there that has not shipped out to wholesale, is that the right assumption there?\nSteve Fasching: Correct. So, when we say in transit, it means it has not arrived at our warehouse. So, it's in the process. So, either on containers or in the ports or on their way to the warehouse. [Indiscernible].\nDave Powers: Months, yes.\nCamilo Lyon: Yes. So, is it fair to say that that Q2 shift will be absorbed in Q3, or is that still uncertain?\nSteve Fasching: No, I would say, back to my earlier comment about a domino effect, we won't be able to make all that up. So, there is a bit of a trickle down. So, I wouldn't add that myth back into Q3 because we're experiencing a domino effect. And as we're seeing, right, there's a continued backlog at the ports.\nCamilo Lyon: Yes. No, definitely. It's pretty pervasive and I think it's gotten worse with each data passes. Okay, so you talked about taking on more inventory and you've said a few different times on the call that you're not concerned about demand trends. Can you just give us some examples of the demand signals that you have been seen probably most importantly at wholesale? And then secondarily, as we think about the comments around taking on more inventory to alleviate any further disruptions how do you feel about or what are the discussions, I should say, with your wholesale partners in terms of any cancellations that may have been discussed? And if that inventory does come back reinstatement of those cancellations, or using your own DTC as the preferred mechanism to satisfy demand, as you get deeper and deeper into the holiday season?\nSteve Fasching: Sure, I'll start and then I'll let Dave go. I think again, from a demand perspective, there's more to demand out there then we can ship to. And, the build-in inventory that you're seeing and our ability to get product to wholesale customers. As a part of that port congestion and delay, we have had conversations with our customers and said kind of here our new expected dates, do you still want product or not? In most cases, absolutely. And they recognize how important both UGG and HOKA are to their businesses. And so, people aren't walking away from orders because they recognize their need to have that product on their shelf. So, we're working through that with them. If they feel it's too late known we'll take some cancellations and then that's our opportunity to fulfill those sales through DTC. And we'll take that at a higher margin. So that's how our approach is.\nDave Powers: Yes. And the signals from wholesale continued to be healthy. Hence that's why they're saying we want the product as soon as we can get it. We'll work with you. And we're getting creative on how we get product to these accounts. But the sell-throughs are healthy across the board for both brands. And as Steve said, there's more demand that we can fulfill at the moment. But we're confident that they're going to converge coming into the busy season. So, we'll have inventory depending on what the channel is, where the consumer wants to shop.\nCamilo Lyon: That sounds great, especially with the weather forecast being for [indiscernible] winter and cold and snowy one. So, it should be good. Last question, just on that inventory composition that you're taking on a bigger bet on, what are the styles that you're thinking about? You're taking a bigger bet on just the core classics or is it a broader array of a product?\nDave Powers: It\u2019s some classics, that it big part of it is product that we can carry over if necessary. So, it\u2019s not liability product generally speaking. And then some obviously the big seasonal sell is like the fluff and the clear \u2013 Tasman, those styles, that\u2019s where the meat of the inventory is and heading into spring, some new fluff introductions evolving into outdoor sandals. And then in HOKA, it\u2019s again driven by Clifton and Bondi, Rincon, top five styles that are doing the business, a lot of the initial drops are kind of one and done until they get a new delivery coming in. So again, it\u2019s product that we know the consumers are going to want when they can get it. And then if we need to carry a little bit over, it sets us up with a bit of a margin tailwind going into next year, because it\u2019s at a lower cost basis and its product that we know we can sell later on in heading into FY2023 if necessary.\nCamilo Lyon: Excellent, best of luck guys.\nDave Powers: I think the bottom line there Camilo, we want the inventory in the country. You wouldn\u2019t want it on a transit or in a factory. And so that\u2019s been our stance and staying aggressive on getting it here.\nCamilo Lyon: I think this might be the first time I\u2019ll ever say, get as much inventory as you possibly can.\nDave Powers: Yes, exactly. Thanks.\nCamilo Lyon: Good luck guys.\nDave Powers: Thank you. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Thank you, guys, for taking my questions. Some of the questions have sort of been answered. So first of all, before we get started, can you give us the wholesale revenue or the direct-to-consumer revenue by brand this way I ask it on the call, which I didn\u2019t do last time, this was coming.\nDave Powers: Sure. Erinn?\nErinn Kohler: Yes. Hi Sam.\nSam Poser: Hi.\nErinn Kohler: So, for a global wholesale and distributor combined for each of the brands for UGG $349 million, for HOKA $147 million, for Teva $19 million, for Sanuk $7 million and others $23 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you. And then the \u2013 I just want to follow-up on the inventory and I concur with Camilo right now, which is shocking, but the question really is what does the inventory look like today, like if you took your inventory as that was $636 million now, how much of that is actually left the building and what does that number look like today? Both from a total and then in transit like if you just as of today.\nDave Powers: Yes. So, I\u2019ve been, that\u2019s right, follow exactly what you\u2019re trying to get at Sam, let me try to answer and you can follow-up.\nSteve Fasching: I think he\u2019s asking of that inventory that was in transit and sitting in the DC since in November.\nSam Poser: No, I mean, I\u2019m just saying you have $636 million less, 45% of that\u2019s on the water, but today, what is your total inventory and how much of that is in transit? So just exactly the same number, but as of today.\nDave Powers: Yes. I think we\u2019ll not give that. What I think your question is the in transit that we had at end of September being processed and the answer is, yes, we are processing some of that. Do we still have a higher proportion of in transit today than we did a year ago? Yes. There is some improvement, so clearly with the seasonality of UGG, this is the time we\u2019re bringing in a lot of inventory, right. And that\u2019s what got caught up in some of this port congestion. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to clear that, and we\u2019re not seeing the improvements to move through that inventory at the port. That\u2019s why you\u2019re still hearing about ships lined up outside the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. So, we are \u2013 where we\u2019re at in our business cycle and the seasonality of the UGG business, there is improvement, but we still have ways to go with in transit 45% compared to 20%. There\u2019s a lot of inventory to work through and because we\u2019re not unique in this, everybody else is I think battling a similar issue. So, we\u2019ll be able to share more later. But hopefully, we\u2019re going to start to see some improvements. We are seeing some just due to where we\u2019re at in line. But there are still some pretty significant congestions in the port.\nSam Poser: And then one last thing, just when you think about the $349 million that you did in a wholesale in the quarter, can we as \u2013 how should we think, I mean, if \u2013 are you \u2013 is a $400 million wholesale number or in that let\u2019s call it Florida, four to slightly higher number for Q3. Is that a reasonable number to think about given the movements around and so on? Or is that \u2013 can you give us some help there?\nDave Powers: Yes. I think the way you\u2019re asking it somewhat to how Camilo asked his question was given how much inventory we had in transit. Had we been able to process that in Q2, would that have driven our UGG number north to a number you\u2019re talking about? Yes, we would\u2019ve. But we\u2019ll see what normal cadence is. Some of that\u2019s being us driving that wholesale replenishment in Q2. So that was a bigger number that we\u2019re working toward and continuing to work toward. But yes, to answer your question, could we have done more, had we had more inventory? Yes.\nSam Poser: I\u2019m really talking about Q3. Am I thinking about $400 million to call it $420 million? Is that a range that is reasonable of sort of within where you\u2019re thinking about your wholesale business for the full year is. Am I in the ballpark on that number? Are we \u2013 it\u2019s a big number, it\u2019s an important quarter? We can\u2019t really guesstimate DTC, but you sort of know what\u2019s where, and you sort of know what you\u2019re thinking can get through.\nDave Powers: Yes. I mean, I think, yes, again, a potential, we\u2019re not giving guidance on the quarter. And we\u2019re still working through congestion at the port, but yes.\nSteve Fasching: We could do that.\nDave Powers: We could do that. We could have done that last quarter. Yes. It\u2019s all dependent on ability to get inventory in and processed and out to our customers.\nSam Poser: Yes. How much have you gotten in and processed in the last three weeks?\nDave Powers: Yes. Well, we haven\u2019t gotten into that, but we\u2019re processing more. Yes.\nSam Poser: All right.\nDave Powers: But again, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 yes.\nSam Poser: I understand. I \u2013 look, I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around the whole thing. So, I mean, you definitely have plenty of ammunition. It\u2019s just a matter of getting it through the process.\nSteve Fasching: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Yes.\nDave Powers: And we\u2019re doing everything we can. And like I said, based on the guidance for the year, we think we can deliver what we said last quarter. And the mix might change between UGG and HOKA little bit, but based off how the trends are continuing and the demand being strong we felt confident we can deliver the year.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much and good luck.\nSteve Fasching: Great.\nSam Poser: Happy holidays.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thanks. Hello. Thank you for taking my question.\nSteve Fasching: Hey Jim.\nDave Powers: Hey Jim.\nJim Duffy: I hope you guys are hanging in there doing well. I wanted to start just by asking, you\u2019ve got a fairly narrow selling window for UGG. What\u2019s the risk that UGG product gets delivered too late in that selling window and becomes carryover inventory. That\u2019s a burden on next year. What can you do to try to prevent that?\nDave Powers: Well, I think we\u2019re doing everything we can to prevent that scenario of happening. The good news is, we know from what we saw last year, when there was lack of inventory in the wholesale channel that people came running to our DTC channel. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence and we\u2019re gearing up for that in November, December, should that be the case? For some reason, we can\u2019t get all the inventory that we want out into the marketplace to the consumers and there\u2019s carryover. We do think that January and February is still going to be strong months for UGG. And I think, in a lot of ways, Christmas is going to be late this year for people. So, I think there will be still an opportunity in Q4 to sell some of that product. But as I said, a lot of this is kind of core carryover product in the UGG brand that we can sell next year. And the benefit of that is that it\u2019ll be a lower cost basis than any new inventory we start producing today for next year. So, it\u2019s a missed litigation plan, where we said, hey, we want to get as much inventory as we can in the pipeline. The demand continues to be super strong. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make Q3 in the year with UGG. And if we don\u2019t, we have carryover inventory, we\u2019re willing to do that, so that we have inventory to go into next fall, and as I said, at a better cost basis.\nSteve Fasching: Just to add on that, Jim, it\u2019s a good question. I think a couple things I\u2019ll add. One, as Dave kind of said is, as everybody knows with all the supply chain constraints going on this year that the holiday selling seasons probably extended on both ends, right. People are being told, buy more early. We\u2019re encouraging people to buy more early as well. They\u2019ll continue to buy up to the holiday season. And for those areas, where people didn\u2019t get what they want, we expect that there will be demand in January. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at that today\u2019s point. We\u2019re happy to fulfill that through DTC, if our wholesale customers want to do that too, we\u2019re happy to provide inventory. You can tell by our inventory number, we\u2019ve got it coming in. We\u2019re going to be able to deal with it. So, I think that\u2019s our approach. The other component, I think that\u2019s important on the inventory is that we\u2019re looking at carryover style. So, as we knew, we were going to buy more inventory this year. We were careful with the inventory that we selected, that we were buying more up. So that if we did have to carry some over, it would be limited in terms of seasonal styles or specific non-carryover styles that we wanted to limit. So again, we\u2019ve been careful, I think, again, the right approach in terms of bringing more on to navigate some of the disruption that we\u2019re seeing, but that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re seeing it play out and then we\u2019ll see what happens.\nJim Duffy: Great. Thanks for that. I wanted to ask a quick one on HOKA, if I may. What we\u2019re hearing from some other players in the athletic category, they are going to be in a position of inventory deficiency in that March quarter, suggesting HOKA has great opportunity for market share gains. How will you think about market share gains in revenue versus margin and the trade off from using expedited freight and so forth to capitalize on that opportunity?\nDave Powers: Well, I think, certainly Q4 for us, our Q4 ending in March is a big opportunity for HOKA. The order book is strong. Hence, you see our guidance maintaining. We have inventory on the way. We had minimal disruptions due to Vietnam production, but we\u2019ve been dual sourcing that. So, the product is being made. It\u2019s just a little bit behind. Our priority is to maintain strength in the marketplace and steal share. And if we have to spend a little money to do that and protect Q4 top line. We think that\u2019s the right approach to do both short-term and long term.\nSteve Fasching: And I think, Jim, also on that, we are buying more, we\u2019re more confident with HOKA, we\u2019re buying more inventory. That is one area that we are willing to spend more on air freight to expedite that in. So that is absolutely a trend if we see in Q4, we are going to be prepared to try to capitalize on.\nDave Powers: Yes. We\u2019re going to continue to stay super aggressive on HOKA. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace. We have newcomers coming in, including ourselves that are stealing share from some of the heritage running brands. It\u2019s continuing to have incredible momentum for us. We do see this as a long term multi-billion-dollar play. And we\u2019re not taking this quarter-to-quarter, but we don\u2019t want to miss any opportunity to steal share and get in on the feet of consumers globally.\nJim Duffy: Excellent. Thank you, guys. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about Europe. It sounds like the adoption there of the fluff franchise has really picked up. Just curious, what ending you think you\u2019re in. And if you feel like, it\u2019s following a similar path, the recovery we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. And then secondarily just wanted to check on sheepskin costs. Have you loss those in for next year yet? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Good question. So, yes, we are seeing good momentum in both Europe and in Asia with the fluff franchise being picked up this year more so than it was last year. So, the trend that started in U.S. is expanding globally. That\u2019s good news for us. And we do think that that franchise is going to continue to be a key part of the brand going forward, including iterations that are in the pipeline to expand into a little bit more outdoor usage, but that is a new leg of the stool, so to speak for the UGG brand going forward. As far as Europe goes, it\u2019s great that we are seeing that adoption. We\u2019re also seeing younger consumers coming into the brand, which is fantastic. And we\u2019ve been working on that for a long time. The unfortunate piece is that this year, the demand is going to be higher than the supply and that challenges the growth opportunity that we were hoping for in the transition and turn around in that marketplace. So, it might take a little bit of longer till we return to full-time consistent growth. We were hopeful that we could do it this year, but I think some of the bottlenecks are going to slow that down, but it\u2019s definitely not because the demand is slow. It\u2019s really driven by the port congestion.\nSteve Fasching: And then Janine, this is Steve. On the sheepskin, we are not seeing a material increase cost in sheepskin. And I think just one important note to also make is that, as Deckers becomes bigger and bigger and the UGG product is much more diversified and HOKA becomes a bigger product are dependence on sheepskin is a lot less than where it was historically. So, we\u2019re moving away with the proportion of sheepskin, makeup of our COGS. But at this point, as we look out at next year, we are not seeing a material increase in our sheepskin costs.\nJanine Stichter: Great. Thank you very much.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thanks so much. My questions just about thinking about gross margins for next year, given the comments you just made about sheepskin. But given the pricing that you\u2019re taking lapping air freight and some of the extra costs that have been in the P&L this year. Does it favorably change the way you\u2019re thinking about margins for next year?\nDave Powers: On the normalized basis, No. It doesn\u2019t. I think this year, we\u2019re getting hit with some headwinds that should not reoccur in future, although, we don\u2019t know the duration of this yet. So, I think that\u2019s going to be a dependent factor that we don\u2019t yet know. I would say, removing all the noise of the current year, we\u2019re not thinking about margins different. So, in terms of product margins, really no change, where we have opportunity is increased proportion of our DTC business. And then I think we\u2019ll see how the current situation plays out. And then when freight rates begin to normalize and I think we\u2019ll then be in a better to provide some outlook next year.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And what sort of the team is don\u2019t think of this as a short-term headwind, meaning the increased cost in the supply chain. This is here to stay. I think it\u2019s going to be with us for, at least a year or two. It may never go back to normal levels due to wage increases, material increases, shipping cost. So, we are planning our business as though those new levels are going to remain. The good news is, if things improve next year, then we have opportunity. And we\u2019re taking price increases to give us the margins that we need going forward, despite the cost increase. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. Again, we\u2019re staying aggressive and if things start to ease up a bit on pricing, we\u2019ll be in better shape. And that\u2019s a combination of price increases that we\u2019re taking and also having some carryover inventory at a lower margin. And then we\u2019ll be spending less than air freight and other cost. And we can reinvest back into the business. It\u2019s not all going fall to the bottom line. We\u2019re focused on the long-term and investing in our key strategic growth priorities. And so that\u2019s really priority number one, is talent, capabilities and awareness for our brands. And then we\u2019ll manage through that.\nJay Sole: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as the conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Deckers delivered another quarter of strong top-line growth made further progress towards key strategies and continued investing to support long-term growth opportunities. Second quarter revenue of $722 million represents an increase of 16% versus the prior year and 33% over the second quarter, two years ago.  Steve will provide additional second quarter context later in the call. But for now, I'd like to highlight the strength of our first half as we build towards delivering an exceptional fiscal year 2022. Six months into this fiscal year, Deckers has driven revenue growth of 35% over last year and earnings per share of $5.37 compared to $3.30 in the previous year. Performance in the first half exemplified the execution of key strategies as HOKA achieved exceptional global growth, delivering back-to-back quarters above $200 million contributing 35% of total revenue, up from 28% last year. And UGG continued to diversify its product portfolio growing double digits across Men's, Kids', and noncore Women's footwear as well as apparel and accessories further establishing itself as a globally relevant lifestyle brand. The increasing global footprint of HOKA, as well as the UGG brand's expansion beyond women's footwear are driving factors of Deckers evolution to a portfolio of powerful lifestyle brands. While we are building towards a bright future, Deckers is not immune to growing pains and global logistics pressures. Like everyone else we have been experiencing logistics bottlenecks that have led to large volumes of our product in transit as of September 30, but currently view ourselves as less vulnerable than others due to our lower exposure to Southern Vietnam production. Our bottlenecks are largely related to import congestion, which has primarily affected the UGG brand as the second quarter historically represents peak levels of fall product arriving from overseas factories. While we successfully shifted more UGG shipments into the first half in response to anticipated logistic issues, we experienced significant delays in containers being processed and released at the ports during the second quarter. We are working diligently with our logistics partners to process these shipments and we'll continue to do so. Steve will provide more details on the global logistical challenges we're experiencing and the actions we've taken to mitigate our risks later in the call. As we navigate through these challenges is we will leverage our omnichannel organization to ensure our brands are getting in front of target consumers with every opportunity to gain a share of closet with a prioritization of high quality, full price sales. Moving to the brand highlights, Global UGG second quarter revenue increased 8% versus last year to $448 million. Performance was driven by the brand's diversified product assortment, reflecting a growing penetration of men's, kids' and non-core women's footwear, as well as growth in apparel and accessories. Direct-to-consumer mix remains well above pre pandemic levels. However, the second quarter still primarily reflected fall product selling to UGG wholesale accounts. As you may recall, sell through of UGG products during last year's fall season was robust, which resulted in depleted marketplace inventories. This provided the opportunity for UGG to leverage its marketplace management strategy and reset wholesale inventories with its most diverse product assortment to date. One of the key drivers of UGG product diversification and acquisition of new and younger consumers has been the brand's fluff franchise. Fluff has been a leading element of brand diversification in the us over the past few years. The UGG product team has continued to infuse excitement and newness into the franchise with additional font colors and patterns of the original Fluff Yeah, which remained the number one DDC acquisition style in Q2, and new outdoor versions, such as the Oh Fluffita and Disco Slide. We're excited to see the franchise begin to resonate internationally as well with over 40% of franchise growth being generated outside of the U.S. in the second quarter. Another area of strength this year has been men's footwear, which increased revenue north of 20% in the second quarter. We have been encouraged by the steady increase in consumer adoption of the men's product line as we invest to build awareness and consideration among male consumers. Development of the UGG Men's business is most prevalent in the U.S. where the brand continues to drive record high levels of consideration among 18- to 34-year-olds with popular products, such as the Tasman, logo versions of the Scuff and colorful versions of the Neumel.  The Tasman, in particular, with its hybrid slipper sneaker attributes is evolving into a very popular style, experiencing considerable growth and helping to make a UGG a brand for the whole family. During the second quarter, the Tasman was a top five style with newly acquired male and female consumers. With its increased adoption and relevance among younger consumers, the UGG team introduced a companion style to the Tasman known as the Tazz. As a platform version of the Tasman, the Tazz is already gaining the attention of consumers and was recently pictured on several high-profile models attending New York Fashion Week. Beyond footwear, the UUG brand is entering its second fall season with its expanded, Ready to Wear apparel collection. The team has done a fantastic job, designing an apparel assortment featuring Cozy Fleece, Sherpa, Full Fur, and Sherling wardrobe items at compelling price points that offer value to the UUG consumer. In support of our commitment to building the lifestyle appeal bug this September, the brand launched its first ever apparel dedicated marketing campaign and influencer program to drive category awareness. The campaign is already generated over $500 million press impressions, including coverage on UGG and in style. In addition to the brand's strategic category marketing investments, UGG is expecting to further enhance its apparel accessories relevance with the second and third product drops of the Telfar collaboration. These upcoming product drops feature hats, hoodies, robes, and other exciting products. These items will be featured online as well as that self-regist pop-up shop in the United Kingdom, which speaks to the UGG brand successful repositioning and increased adoption in Europe, as well as greater acceptance of UGG as a head-to-toe brand. UGG is making great headway attracting new consumers in a EMEA as just under half of the brand second quarter online purchases were new to the brand. Key styles driving consumer acquisition in the region were the Classic Mini, Classic Clear and the men's Ascot. Moving on to China. I'm pleased report that UGG is making excellent progress as the region posted the highest growth rate across the globe during the second quarter. Beyond significant revenue growth, UGG is experiencing success on a number of fronts in China, including launching a second regional specific collaboration with designer Feng Chen Wang, which is helping UGG reconnect with the Chinese fashion consumer using a broader and more inclusive community of influencers to create a greater frequency of consumer touch points. Building the DTC business by driving increased traffic and conversion at stores and generating consumer excitement with bold new product offerings, including key styles such as the Classic Clear, Ultra Mini and the Oh Fluffita. Looking towards the second half of fiscal 2022 for UGG, we expect to drive sell through with the brand's diversified product assortment, both with our wholesale partners and through our direct-to-consumer channels. We have confidence in the continued strong demand for the UGG brand and are actively working to mitigate macro supply chain challenges to deliver peak holiday season sales. Lastly, on the UGG front, you may have seen a recent release that UGG brand President, Andrea O'Donnell left the company to pursue a tremendous career opportunity, and we wish her, her the best. Fortunately, we have a strong UGG team in place, which was recently bolstered by the addition of two Vice Presidents that will be leading the marketing and women's product teams. While we identify a new permanent leader for the brand, I'm excited to be overseeing the talented UGG team and build on their establishment of UGG as a global leading lifestyle brand. That creates bold, exciting and luxurious products for passionate consumers. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue in the second quarter increased 47% versus last year to $210 million. The HOKA ecosystem continues to experience exceptionally balanced growth across the brand's global points of distribution and portfolio of products. HOKA has maintained a strategic and thoughtful approach to distribution management. Our goal is to build an audience of consumers through authentic performance driven product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing, and a premium consumer experience across all the brands access points. The brand continues its highly selective approach to distribution expansion and remains focused on building market share through avenues that have the resources to educate consumers on the benefits and differentiators of HOKA. With that in mind and a focus on increasing brand awareness and key markets, HOKA recently opened pop-up retail stores in New York, in Los Angeles, as well as the brands first owned and operated stores in China. The HOKA retail strategy is in the infancy stage. The brand is testing multiple strategies and learning from our results and feedback to provide the ultimate consumer experience, which currently features community events and workshops designed to bring HOKA consumers together. Though too soon to make any definitive statements on HOKA stores, we have been very pleased with the initial response from a foot traffic, sales and service perspective. HOKA is already benefiting from Deckers organizational retail expertise developed in connection with the UGG brand. This wealth of experience is proving valuable in the early days of establishing HOKA store operations and highlighting the synergies gained by operating a portfolio of brands. Once we land on the optimum consumer experience and concept for HOKA stores will look to open additional locations in China first to serve that model brand market and then begin exploring longer-term opportunities in North America and Europe. A key piece of our long-term retail strategy is a development of a compelling apparel product line that can provide a broader consumer experience at our HOKA stores. Conversion to apparel purchasing is proving to be more successful in our stores than online. As HOKA has sold a higher percentage of apparel at retail compared to e-commerce since the stores have opened. While we are still very early in developing the HOKA apparel strategy and product line, we are actively building an exceptional team to support this phenomenal brand's long-term opportunities, so stay tuned. On the digital front, HOKA was able to grow its consumer audience through a 97% increase in global acquisition online during the quarter. The brand has been prioritizing digital marketing avenues that target 18- to 34-year-old consumers. As a result, HOKA DTC acquisitions significantly over indexes toward these younger consumers. We are pleased to see that the younger consumers are adopting the HOKA brand both through its heritage Clifton and Bondi styles, as well as through newer styles aimed at the demographic such as the Mach 4 and the Rincon 3. From an international perspective, DTC remains a much smaller proportion of the business, but HOKA is scaling its DTC mix very quickly, as DTC growth is significantly outpacing wholesale. Considerable gains and consumer acquisition and retention in the UK and Germany, two of the HOKA brands key focus markets are driving the exceptional growth rate of EMEA DTC. The EMEA region continues to be the HOKA brand's largest international region. Worldwide HOKA is gaining momentum. And through the first half of this year, every global region has posted double-digit growth as compared to last year. I also want to highlight the HOKA brand's recent announcement of a multi-year sponsorship for the UTMB World Series. The Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc or UTMB for short is the world's ultimate running trail circuit, which includes over 20 events on six continents in 2022. Sponsoring the UTMB as the premier technical footwear and apparel partner is a big marketing and promotional opportunity for HOKA. We will leverage this partnership to build awareness of the brand's globally relevant performance driven products, a big thank you to the HOKA marketing team for making this sponsorship a reality. Heading into the final months of 2021, the HOKA team has been reviewing consumer insights, market research and product launch calendar for spring 2022 and input cost pressures to determine if there are strategic actions, we can take to navigate this dynamic environment. As we've done with our other brands, HOKA has identified specific products for which there is opportunity to increase price to in better align with competitive offerings, partially offset macro input cost pressures, and maintain the brand's premium positioning and relative margin strength versus peers. The HOKA team also continues to review planned product launch dates and will make strategic adjustments to ensure healthy full price sell through of existing and future models just has the brand has done in the past. HOKA is well-positioned to gain greater market share globally as the brand expands consumer awareness through strategic marketing activations, including event sponsorships, pop-up retail, digital targeting, and forthcoming brand campaigns. Congratulations to the entire HOKA team on another stellar quarter. We look forward to continued brand execution for the second half of fiscal year 2022 and beyond, as HOKA builds to a multi-billion-dollar leader in the performance lifestyle space. With respect to channel performance in the second quarter, global wholesale revenue increased 21% versus prior year and plus 23% versus two years ago. Wholesale comparisons continue to be unique as we're lapping some disruption in the prior year and currently facing macro logistics pressures and bottlenecks that have altered shipment timing as compared to historical patterns. UGG and HOKA drove wholesale growth as UGG is refilling depleted marketplace inventories, while gaining incremental volume in new categories and HOKA continues to gain market share globally. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, global revenue increased 3% versus last year and plus 79% versus two years ago. HOKA drove the majority of DTC growth as UGG remained pressured by exceptional demand last year that resulted from pandemic tailwinds, benefiting the brand online. Line while UGG DTC declined as compared to last year, the brand is still plus 37% above pre-pandemic second quarter DTC volume. HOKA DTC increased 81% versus last year, which is on top of the prior year's triple digit increase, reflecting the brand's consumer acquisition gains in greater repeat purchasing from existing consumers. Before handing off to Steve, I want to take a moment to recognize our company, brands and employees, recent activities on the sustainability ESG and DEI fronts, which we believe are a positive contributor to our company culture, local communities, and consumer passions for our brand. A few key highlights from our recent achievements, include UGG introducing its icon impact collection, which was thoughtfully designed using low impact materials in combination with offsets to make the collection carbon neutral. Teva launching the ReEmber collection that features 100% recycled ripstop upper material. All of our brands reducing their per pair emissions in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and our employees around the globe participating in another art of kindness week, during which we collectively donated over 4,300 hours contributing to 317 organizations around the world. A big thanks to our employees for their continued dedication to giving back. Additionally, I'm excited to announce that our 2021 corporate responsibility report will be released next week. The report contains a great deal of information on Deckers corporate social responsibility journey, including the filing and approval of science-based targets and the setting of robust carbon reduction targets. I'd encourage you all to take a look, as this report, highlights the passion and commitment of our company and our employees to do good and do great. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our second quarter financial results, status of the dynamic supply chain challenges the industry is facing, as well as our updated fiscal year 2022 outlook. Thanks Steve. The company's performance over the past six months highlights the strength of our brand portfolio and value of our operating model. Our largest brands, UGG and HOKA are delivering compelling growth in the midst of historic levels of supply chain disruption. In spite of this turmoil, the company continues to generate strong cash flow that enables our leadership team to continue making key strategic investments that will contribute to Deckers long-term growth and success. Our focus remains to increase global awareness and adoption of HOKA as we work towards building a powerful multi-billion-dollar performance brand, build the global adoption of UGG across a diverse set of consumers, categories, seasons and regions, and acquire consumers direct into our ecosystem with the goal of scaling our DTC mix of business to 50% of revenue over time. We are proud of our employees continued progress on these key initiatives and appreciate their buy-in to make our collective organizational success a reality. In the last 18 plus months, which are unprecedented in modern history, our employees have proven the value of our collaborative and winning culture. This reflects in both our financial performance, but also in the progress we continue to make on the ESG and DEI fronts. I'm delighted to share that the culture of Deckers is being recognized outside of our organization as well. Earlier this month, Deckers was ranked six on Newsweek's list of the 100 most loved workplaces. On behalf of the board and the management team I am extremely proud of this distinction as we continue to live our values by fostering a positive environment that allows employees to come as you are. Recognition like this matters a great deal, especially when we are building our workforce for the future. For more on our global efforts supporting Deckers culture and values, I would want again encourage everyone to take a look at our 2021 corporate responsibility report that will be released next week. I'd like to thank you all for joining us here today and to thank all of our stakeholder for your continued support. We look forward to sharing Deckers continued bright future with you. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes. I would echo that, and I think as Steve said, we were proactive in getting ahead of this with increasing our production at the end of last year, going into the beginning of this year. Making sure we had plenty of goods to sell, knowing that prices are going to go up and that the supply chain challenges could persist. That's proven to be true. The good news is the inventories on its way. We have a large number on the water in transit. And we feel confident that we'll have the inventory particularly as it relates to UGG in Q3 in the marketplace, going into peak season, whether that's at wholesaler or DTC, we'll be prepared for the busy season of UGG. And then the other, the next piece of that is just preparing for Q4 for UGG, but also really HOKA when this starts ripping up. So, if the day-by-day navigation of when it's going to be here? How it's going to get here, but we have incredible relationships with our factory partners. We have incredible relationships with our wholesale partners and we're all in this together to get to the inventory out to the consumer's passes and best positioned as we can. Yes. I'll let Steve answer that. The challenges with UGG really, it's not a demand challenge at all. We still have very strong demand from our consumer and our wholesaler accounts are telling us that they generally speaking still wanted the product. So, it's more about the ability for us to product out of the distribution network due to the bottlenecks in Q2, but the demand is very strong. So, it's just a matter of getting caught up. With Steve you detailed... Yes. We saw that last year when there was scarcity in the marketplace for wholesale, we saw consumers going direct to our DTC channels, mostly our website at the time, hence the challenge on the comp this year in that channel. But I think as I said, going into November, December, we have the inventory and we'll be ready depending on how the consumer wants to shop. Yes. And we've taken a conservative approach on it. So, it could improve, but right now, from where we stand today, calling the ball, this is what we think is prudent. Yes. And I think Jon on that early to tell, right, and it's going to be dependent on when we begin to see normalized freight around containers. So, what we're experiencing this year, hopefully we aren't going to necessarily see on an ongoing basis. So, the sooner we can get back to a more normalized level that will be tailwind on the margin front. And then on the air freight, additionally, with the extra inventory that we're are bringing in this year should provide a tailwind for us. But I want to be a little careful about getting too far ahead of ourselves on how much margin takeback we get next year. Thanks, Jon. Months, yes. Yes. And the signals from wholesale continued to be healthy. Hence that's why they're saying we want the product as soon as we can get it. We'll work with you. And we're getting creative on how we get product to these accounts. But the sell-throughs are healthy across the board for both brands. And as Steve said, there's more demand that we can fulfill at the moment. But we're confident that they're going to converge coming into the busy season. So, we'll have inventory depending on what the channel is, where the consumer wants to shop. It's some classics, that it big part of it is product that we can carry over if necessary. So, it's not liability product generally speaking. And then some obviously the big seasonal sell is like the fluff and the clear \u2013 Tasman, those styles, that's where the meat of the inventory is and heading into spring, some new fluff introductions evolving into outdoor sandals. And then in HOKA, it's again driven by Clifton and Bondi, Rincon, top five styles that are doing the business, a lot of the initial drops are kind of one and done until they get a new delivery coming in. So again, it's product that we know the consumers are going to want when they can get it. And then if we need to carry a little bit over, it sets us up with a bit of a margin tailwind going into next year, because it's at a lower cost basis and its product that we know we can sell later on in heading into FY2023 if necessary. I think the bottom line there Camilo, we want the inventory in the country. You wouldn't want it on a transit or in a factory. And so that's been our stance and staying aggressive on getting it here. Yes, exactly. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Sure. Erinn? Yes. So, I've been, that's right, follow exactly what you're trying to get at Sam, let me try to answer and you can follow-up. Yes. I think we'll not give that. What I think your question is the in transit that we had at end of September being processed and the answer is, yes, we are processing some of that. Do we still have a higher proportion of in transit today than we did a year ago? Yes. There is some improvement, so clearly with the seasonality of UGG, this is the time we're bringing in a lot of inventory, right. And that's what got caught up in some of this port congestion. It's going to take a little bit of time to clear that, and we're not seeing the improvements to move through that inventory at the port. That's why you're still hearing about ships lined up outside the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. So, we are \u2013 where we're at in our business cycle and the seasonality of the UGG business, there is improvement, but we still have ways to go with in transit 45% compared to 20%. There's a lot of inventory to work through and because we're not unique in this, everybody else is I think battling a similar issue. So, we'll be able to share more later. But hopefully, we're going to start to see some improvements. We are seeing some just due to where we're at in line. But there are still some pretty significant congestions in the port. Yes. I think the way you're asking it somewhat to how Camilo asked his question was given how much inventory we had in transit. Had we been able to process that in Q2, would that have driven our UGG number north to a number you're talking about? Yes, we would've. But we'll see what normal cadence is. Some of that's being us driving that wholesale replenishment in Q2. So that was a bigger number that we're working toward and continuing to work toward. But yes, to answer your question, could we have done more, had we had more inventory? Yes. Yes. I mean, I think, yes, again, a potential, we're not giving guidance on the quarter. And we're still working through congestion at the port, but yes. We could do that. We could have done that last quarter. Yes. It's all dependent on ability to get inventory in and processed and out to our customers. Yes. Well, we haven't gotten into that, but we're processing more. Yes. But again, I mean, it's \u2013 yes. And we're doing everything we can. And like I said, based on the guidance for the year, we think we can deliver what we said last quarter. And the mix might change between UGG and HOKA little bit, but based off how the trends are continuing and the demand being strong we felt confident we can deliver the year. Thanks, Sam. Hey Jim. Well, I think we're doing everything we can to prevent that scenario of happening. The good news is, we know from what we saw last year, when there was lack of inventory in the wholesale channel that people came running to our DTC channel. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence and we're gearing up for that in November, December, should that be the case? For some reason, we can't get all the inventory that we want out into the marketplace to the consumers and there's carryover. We do think that January and February is still going to be strong months for UGG. And I think, in a lot of ways, Christmas is going to be late this year for people. So, I think there will be still an opportunity in Q4 to sell some of that product. But as I said, a lot of this is kind of core carryover product in the UGG brand that we can sell next year. And the benefit of that is that it'll be a lower cost basis than any new inventory we start producing today for next year. So, it's a missed litigation plan, where we said, hey, we want to get as much inventory as we can in the pipeline. The demand continues to be super strong. We're going to do everything we can to make Q3 in the year with UGG. And if we don't, we have carryover inventory, we're willing to do that, so that we have inventory to go into next fall, and as I said, at a better cost basis. Well, I think, certainly Q4 for us, our Q4 ending in March is a big opportunity for HOKA. The order book is strong. Hence, you see our guidance maintaining. We have inventory on the way. We had minimal disruptions due to Vietnam production, but we've been dual sourcing that. So, the product is being made. It's just a little bit behind. Our priority is to maintain strength in the marketplace and steal share. And if we have to spend a little money to do that and protect Q4 top line. We think that's the right approach to do both short-term and long term. Yes. We're going to continue to stay super aggressive on HOKA. It's a competitive marketplace. We have newcomers coming in, including ourselves that are stealing share from some of the heritage running brands. It's continuing to have incredible momentum for us. We do see this as a long term multi-billion-dollar play. And we're not taking this quarter-to-quarter, but we don't want to miss any opportunity to steal share and get in on the feet of consumers globally. You bet. Yes. Good question. So, yes, we are seeing good momentum in both Europe and in Asia with the fluff franchise being picked up this year more so than it was last year. So, the trend that started in U.S. is expanding globally. That's good news for us. And we do think that that franchise is going to continue to be a key part of the brand going forward, including iterations that are in the pipeline to expand into a little bit more outdoor usage, but that is a new leg of the stool, so to speak for the UGG brand going forward. As far as Europe goes, it's great that we are seeing that adoption. We're also seeing younger consumers coming into the brand, which is fantastic. And we've been working on that for a long time. The unfortunate piece is that this year, the demand is going to be higher than the supply and that challenges the growth opportunity that we were hoping for in the transition and turn around in that marketplace. So, it might take a little bit of longer till we return to full-time consistent growth. We were hopeful that we could do it this year, but I think some of the bottlenecks are going to slow that down, but it's definitely not because the demand is slow. It's really driven by the port congestion. You bet. On the normalized basis, No. It doesn't. I think this year, we're getting hit with some headwinds that should not reoccur in future, although, we don't know the duration of this yet. So, I think that's going to be a dependent factor that we don't yet know. I would say, removing all the noise of the current year, we're not thinking about margins different. So, in terms of product margins, really no change, where we have opportunity is increased proportion of our DTC business. And then I think we'll see how the current situation plays out. And then when freight rates begin to normalize and I think we'll then be in a better to provide some outlook next year. Thanks."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We're excited by the demand. Our brands continue to exhibit through the first half of this fiscal year. As Dave covered, UGG is setting up the holiday season with its most diverse product assortment today. And HOKA is delivering exceptionally balanced, strong growth and market share gains across regions, channels and categories. While the supply chain remains a headwind to overcome. The performance of our brands thus far is the result of our team's dedication to executing Deckers long term strategies, as we manage through near-term disruption. The strength of our brand portfolio, our flexible operating model and robust balance sheet gives us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate the evolving marketplace. Now let me get into the second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue was $722 million, representing a 16% increase versus last year and a 33% increase versus two years ago. Q2 growth versus last year was driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA. As UGG wholesale increased 19% versus last year, as we ship more product into the channel, though, we did experience pressures from port delays and HOKA continued to deliver and press of growth across all channels with an increase of 47%. Gross margins for the second quarter were down 30 basis points versus last year to 50.9%. The decreases compared to last year was related to increased usage of air freight for the UGG wholesale brands and higher than prior year proportion of wholesale shipments. As we refill marketplace inventories and lap disruption from the prior year. With positive offsets coming from favorable brand mix, as HOKA continues to increase as a percentage of total company sales, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and fewer closeouts at a higher margin rate. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $239 million up 25% from last year's 190 million, higher spend was primarily driven by greater marketing expense to fuel brand heat, highlight new categories and increased localized content, increased compensation costs as we onboard new talent to support our growing organization and higher variable expenses related to increased volume for our warehouse logistics and IT. Our tax rate was 20.1%, which compares to 20.6% last year. This all resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.66 per the quarter, which compares to $3.58 in last year's second quarter. The $0.08 increase versus last year was primarily driven by revenue growth of the UGG and HOKA brands with offsets from increased SG&A spend primarily related to increased marketing and headcount supporting the growth of the business. Turning to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2021, we ended September with $746 million of cash and equivalent. Inventory, including units in-transit with $636 million, up 31% from $484 at the same time last year and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $54 million worth of shares at an average price of $406. That brings the year-to-date total share purchase as of September 30 to $136 million at an average share price of $356.08. And as of September 30, 2021, the company had $675 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Before discussing our updated outlook for fiscal year 2022, I'd like to provide some context on the current state of our supply chain, our disruption mitigation efforts and trends we are seeing. Starting with footwear production. I can confirm the majority of our products are produced in Vietnam. However, due to the location of our factories, which are primarily in Northern Vietnam, as well as the seasonality of our business and strategic product prioritization. We do not expect factory shutdowns that occurred in the second quarter to cause a material negative top line effect on our full year fiscal 2022 guidance. To put this in perspective, less than 10% of our Vietnam production today is done in the Southern region, which experienced shutdowns during the second quarter. However, our team successfully shifted a material portion of this production to alternative existing partner factories by leveraging our dual sourcing strategy, which allows us to manufacture same styles in multiple factories. While we were able to nimbly shift production locations, the expected timing of these receipts will be later than we previously planned, those still expected within the current year. As part of our ongoing sourcing strategy to support the growth of our brands and in an effort to further mitigate impacts into fiscal year 2023, we have secured additional production lines in new geographic locations with our existing partners and have also on-boarded long-term strategic factory partners. In addition, we plan to carry more inventory this year and into next year as we do not anticipate any near-term resolution to the global supply chain disruption, and it will also act as a hedge to inflationary pressures expected in FY23. From a logistics standpoint, we are not unique in that we are deal with significant delays at ports related to not only prolonged processing times for ship cargo, but also a shortage of trucks, chassis, and drivers. While the challenges at the port of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been widely reported, the issue is not isolated to those ports and port constraints have postponed shipments to our warehouses in Q2. In a typical year roughly 20% of inventory is in transit at the end of September. But this year with the bottlenecks that we've experienced, approximately 45% of our inventory was in transit. Even with product beginning to move off the water, as well as packed and staged at the warehouse. Some of our wholesale partners are experiencing labor shortages and logistic constraints in their own operations, which is further hindering our ability to deliver shipments in a timely manner. Additionally, on the international front we've experienced numerous startup challenges during our 3PL distribution center transition in Europe and expect there will be continued pressures as they refine their systems and delivery levels. While the transition has been difficult, especially in light of the challenging global logistics environment, this is a critical investment to create long-term capacity that will facilitate anticipated growth in the UGG and HOKA brands for years to come. We will continue to work closely with our provider to assist with improving throughput as their operations come up to speed. From a freight expense standpoint, the entire industry continues to face higher costs for ocean containers. In addition, as production and port delays persist on top of delays arising from production shifts in Vietnam, we will continue to utilize elevated levels of air freight, which is considerably more expensive whenever it is needed to maintain strategic product launches. As Dave mentioned, the HOKA brand is implementing targeted price increases for specific products, which will help partially offset higher air freight costs, but we will still expect, there will be some level of gross margin compression. As with the rest of our peers and industry we're dealing with a number of challenges, but I have the utmost confidence in our employees and their resilience to overcome these hurdles. With that context in mind, we are adjusting our outlook to reflect these supply side risks. For the full fiscal year 2022 we are reiterating our expected top line revenue growth of 18% to 20%, which equates to revenue in the range of $3.01 billion to $3.06 billion, including expectations of HOKA growing 50-plus percent over last year with confidence the brand can include $875 million of revenue. UGG growing high single digits, reflecting pressure on the prior high end of the range due to shipment disruption, Teva's still growing in the high-teens range and Koolaburra and Sanuk expected to be approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is now expected to approximately 51.5%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to further pressures from increasing costs related to ocean containers and greater utilization of air freight as port congestion and trucking scarcity has worsened. SG&A is now expected to be approximately 34% of revenue reflecting our operating models, agility in this dynamic environment to flex our variable spend with targeted temporary reductions. We anticipate these expense adjustments will help offset further gross margin pressure allowing us to maintain the prior high end of our operating margin range at 18%. We are lowering the bottom end of the operating margin to 17% to reflect current port congestion conditions that may necessitate more air freight. We still expect a tax rate of approximately 23%. Taking into account the risk factors I have mentioned along with the share repurchase executed in the second quarter, we are expanding our earnings per share guidance range for fiscal year 2022 to now be in the range of $14.15 to $15.15. While we have tried to incorporate what we know at this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate any further significant supply chain disruption excludes one-time charges and does not contemplate impact from additional share purchases. Although supply chain pressures have grown across the entire industry. We remain confident in maintaining our prior top line revenue guidance as our brands continue to experience exceptional marketplace demand. Actions our teams have taken to preserve this outlook include bringing greater levels of inventory earlier to mitigate delays and inflationary cost pressures. Utilizing our dual sourcing network to offset factory closures and disruption, adding production capacity and further diversifying our country level exposure of factories and partners, increasing air freight usage to ensure our brands are opportunistically gaining market share in this competitive environment, strategically evaluating and leveraging our brands, price, elasticity and remaining nimble in responding to new challenges as they arise. A combination of these efforts has enabled us to maintain the top end of our operating margin outlook, while expanding the range of our earnings guidance to reflect the current challenges of the supply chain environment. Deckers continues to deliver strong growth with excellent levels of profitability and is operating from a position of strength. Thanks everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Sure. Dana, this is Steve. I'll take a first stab and then Dave can jump in. I think in terms of cadence, how we're looking at is, as we've said in the script, we're going to be buying more inventory this year because, while we don't know exact timing and we're focused on the year. We do want to make sure that we have goods in place to sell. So, as we see it, our ending position at Q2 we had about the same amount of inventory in the way warehouse a year ago, even though we had that in 30% increase. So, we're going to continue to process that inventory. There is a bit of a domino effect that the delays are going to impact other inbound inventory. So, we're very focused on processing what we can through the port congestion. We will supplement it with air freight were appropriate, especially around product launches. And so, we're going to continue to do that. I think the strategy of buying more inventory early on at the beginning of this year was the right strategy. And so, the inventory's not the issue. Demand is not the issue. It's just our ability to process inventory work through, port congestion, and as we said trucks and chassis, as well as working with our wholesale customers to get them to pick it up because they're experiencing similar challenges with arranging trucks and drivers. So overall would've liked to have done more, but we're dealing with what we have and I think we've good a good strategy to approach it. The follow-up. Yes. So, we didn't do a lot of price increases, generally speaking for this current fall. HOKA has taken prices up surgically, I would say with their big styles starting in spring introductions and that's embedded in the guidance. And then for fall 2022, we will be taking prices up for the UGG brand. And I'm confident that based on the strength of the brand and the consumer sentiment in the market, we have the ability to do that. And fortunately, a lot of the inventory that we have coming in the pipeline is on a lower cost basis than it will be next year. So that works to our advantage, but we will be taking price increases going into FY23, starting in the fall with UGG. Thank you. Yes, I think Jon, yes, in terms of the guidance, how we're looking at UGG, we shaved a little off the top end and I think that has to do, as we said around the disruption that we're seeing and the port congestion, so inability to get some product on time, we think is going to put some pressure on our ability to sell to that high end. That's going to be, I think equally felt as we look at it now. The dynamics that we don't know yet is really how the selling season plays out. So, assuming things improve from where we were at the end of Q2, and we were able to get more product to process through our warehouse we'll be able to process those wholesale orders. Again, then depending on what happens there we'll determine how we handle DTC business. So, we could see an increase in our DTC business with improvement and product, but that'll be dependent to on how much honestly, we ship really in the next kind of month and a half. So hard to say kind of how the channels work out, but we're going to be prepared that if there is some disruption to shipping in our wholesale customers, we'll pick that up through our DTC channels. So, we're remaining pretty flexible on that, hard to say exactly how that plays out. Just a little bit of caution because of the disruption that we've seen, again the domino effective of when that's going to, and how that's going to play out, but we will be you prepared to pick up any of those wholesale sales that may get missed with our own DTC business. Yes, sure Jon. So, before we got into just under, I think, 53, we're now about 51.5, that difference is really increased ocean freight as well as more air freight. And so, if you look at the first half of the year, the first half of the year, a lot of that inventory was transported before we're seeing the increases around ocean freight. So, we're anticipating a much bigger hit in the second half related to ocean freight increases. So, the inventory that's in transit and flowing in now is coming in at a higher freight cost, then also supplementing it with more air freight that we expect to experience in the second half. So, the price increases that we're implementing with HOKA will help offset, but it's still relatively small in the big scheme of things. So yes, it's able to help mitigate it to a very small extent and that less than 150 basis point margin hit on the year that we're now projecting is really ocean freight increases largely that we expect to experience in the second half, as well as some supplemental air freight that we did do and will do more of in the second half. That's the goal is to get it back. And so, the price increases discussions that we're having in the brand are pretty broad based, including some kind of core classics in the mix still early days, but that's how we're thinking about it, get back to normalized levels. Yes. Okay. Yes, I think again, we're looking at the whole year, haven't given guidance, but if you look at what we were expecting in terms of inbound inventory that remained in transit yes, you're right in terms of how much you could probably extrapolate of what we thought we could have turned on that inbound inventory. That got really hung up in transit during the quarter. Correct. So, when we say in transit, it means it has not arrived at our warehouse. So, it's in the process. So, either on containers or in the ports or on their way to the warehouse. [Indiscernible]. No, I would say, back to my earlier comment about a domino effect, we won't be able to make all that up. So, there is a bit of a trickle down. So, I wouldn't add that myth back into Q3 because we're experiencing a domino effect. And as we're seeing, right, there's a continued backlog at the ports. Sure, I'll start and then I'll let Dave go. I think again, from a demand perspective, there's more to demand out there then we can ship to. And, the build-in inventory that you're seeing and our ability to get product to wholesale customers. As a part of that port congestion and delay, we have had conversations with our customers and said kind of here our new expected dates, do you still want product or not? In most cases, absolutely. And they recognize how important both UGG and HOKA are to their businesses. And so, people aren't walking away from orders because they recognize their need to have that product on their shelf. So, we're working through that with them. If they feel it's too late known we'll take some cancellations and then that's our opportunity to fulfill those sales through DTC. And we'll take that at a higher margin. So that's how our approach is. I think he's asking of that inventory that was in transit and sitting in the DC since in November. We could do that. That's right. That's right. Yes. Great. Hey Jim. Just to add on that, Jim, it's a good question. I think a couple things I'll add. One, as Dave kind of said is, as everybody knows with all the supply chain constraints going on this year that the holiday selling seasons probably extended on both ends, right. People are being told, buy more early. We're encouraging people to buy more early as well. They'll continue to buy up to the holiday season. And for those areas, where people didn't get what they want, we expect that there will be demand in January. So that's the way we're looking at that today's point. We're happy to fulfill that through DTC, if our wholesale customers want to do that too, we're happy to provide inventory. You can tell by our inventory number, we've got it coming in. We're going to be able to deal with it. So, I think that's our approach. The other component, I think that's important on the inventory is that we're looking at carryover style. So, as we knew, we were going to buy more inventory this year. We were careful with the inventory that we selected, that we were buying more up. So that if we did have to carry some over, it would be limited in terms of seasonal styles or specific non-carryover styles that we wanted to limit. So again, we've been careful, I think, again, the right approach in terms of bringing more on to navigate some of the disruption that we're seeing, but that's kind of how we're seeing it play out and then we'll see what happens. And I think, Jim, also on that, we are buying more, we're more confident with HOKA, we're buying more inventory. That is one area that we are willing to spend more on air freight to expedite that in. So that is absolutely a trend if we see in Q4, we are going to be prepared to try to capitalize on. And then Janine, this is Steve. On the sheepskin, we are not seeing a material increase cost in sheepskin. And I think just one important note to also make is that, as Deckers becomes bigger and bigger and the UGG product is much more diversified and HOKA becomes a bigger product are dependence on sheepskin is a lot less than where it was historically. So, we're moving away with the proportion of sheepskin, makeup of our COGS. But at this point, as we look out at next year, we are not seeing a material increase in our sheepskin costs. Yes. And what sort of the team is don't think of this as a short-term headwind, meaning the increased cost in the supply chain. This is here to stay. I think it's going to be with us for, at least a year or two. It may never go back to normal levels due to wage increases, material increases, shipping cost. So, we are planning our business as though those new levels are going to remain. The good news is, if things improve next year, then we have opportunity. And we're taking price increases to give us the margins that we need going forward, despite the cost increase. So that's how we're thinking about it. Again, we're staying aggressive and if things start to ease up a bit on pricing, we'll be in better shape. And that's a combination of price increases that we're taking and also having some carryover inventory at a lower margin. And then we'll be spending less than air freight and other cost. And we can reinvest back into the business. It's not all going fall to the bottom line. We're focused on the long-term and investing in our key strategic growth priorities. And so that's really priority number one, is talent, capabilities and awareness for our brands. And then we'll manage through that."

We are excited to discuss a strong start to fiscal year 2022 for our portfolio of category-leading brands. First quarter revenue increased 78% versus last year, to $505 million. Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 51.6%, and we delivered a profitable June ended quarter with earnings per share of $1.71. While unique marketplace dynamics contributed to this, we believe the growing influence of HOKA, with its more evenly spread seasonal volumes, will continue to drive our organization toward a more balanced business across quarters. Performance in the first quarter was driven by global wholesale growth of the UGG, HOKA and Teva brands, whose compelling products are continuing to build market share and overcome a disruption in the channel that began during the pandemic. The direct-to-consumer growth in HOKA, as the brand continues to build awareness through digital marketing, introduced innovative products and category disruptors that drive new consumer acquisition and deliver a consistent consumer experience for online replenishment. Additionally, our brands are benefiting from strategic marketplace management globally, which continues to drive high rates of full price selling across our entire portfolio of brands. This quarter represents further progress toward our long-term strategies, which include accelerating consumer adoption of the HOKA brand globally, to build the brand's revenue to $1 billion and beyond, building UGG as a year-round global lifestyle brand through a diverse product offering and executing a digital-first approach by prioritizing direct-to-consumer acquisition online and working towards a direct business that will represent 50% of total revenue for the company over time. While we remain firmly committed to these strategies over the long term, it is important to recognize certain aspects unique to fiscal 2022 related to lapping the pandemic, which is still having varying effects in different locations. Specific to the quarter just completed, we experienced higher wholesale shipment volumes as well as earlier shipments as compared to the prior year. The earlier shipments primarily relate to replenishment of depleted UGG wholesale account inventories that resulted from exceptionally high levels of sell-through during fiscal 2021. These earlier shipments for UGG, combined with strong demand for spring and summer products across our entire portfolio of brands, drove a significant increase in our wholesale business. Given the momentum of our brands and their respective market share opportunities, we are focused on meeting consumers where they want to shop to optimize growth in this less than certain marketplace, but remain committed to driving direct-to-consumer demand over the longer term. Steve will provide more detail around the unique dynamics we are anticipating for the balance of this year, later in the call. For now, I will share more detail around first quarter brand and channel level performance and some context for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Starting with the brand highlights. Global UGG first quarter revenue increased 71% versus last year to $213 million. Performance was driven by strength in domestic and international wholesale as the brand lapped disruption in last year's spring season and refilled depleted domestic inventory that resulted from record sell-through in the prior season. Growth of international DTC, as UGG benefited from localized marketing investments to reignite the brand in Europe and China, which was partially offset by softness in domestic DTC resulting from the decline of extraordinary slipper growth unique to last year's stay at home orders. The strength of Global UGG wholesale resulted from the brand's marketplace management strategies that left UGG with unusually lean inventories entering the year. This positioned UGG to accelerate some woodbefall shipments, helping avoid anticipated bottlenecks in the supply chain and providing the brand with an opportunity to meet in-store consumer demand. We saw this strategy play out effectively as online traffic for UGG was predictably lower than last year's exceptionally high levels, while sell-through at physical retail is strong. With a highly fluid consumer environment, we're managing our omnichannel business to ensure UGG has a meaningful presence with the brand's target consumers' intent to spend. However, we continue to closely manage our product allocation and segmentation strategies to ensure UGG maintains healthy levels of full price sell-through. UGG continues to see high levels of consumer demand as the brand maintained positive mind share with 18 to 34 year olds in the US. According to YouGov, brand consideration among women in this group remained roughly flat to last year's record highs. And among men, UGG brand consideration is at an all-time high. These new levels of consideration among men are leading to the growth of UGG Men's continuing to outpace that of the total brand. Helping to drive more consumer loving connection for the brand, UGG recently held its fifth annual PROUD Prom event in partnership with the Pacific Pride Foundation. This event is an inclusive opportunity for UGG to connect with local LGBTQIA Plus and allied-youth from Santa Barbara and surrounding coastal communities that celebrates identity and love. This year's event featured friends of the UGG brand that included musical artists, Lil Nas X and actress Hari Nef. Further on the brand building front, UGG has continued to engage with brands and designers to create powerful product collaborations that elevate the brand's fashion credibility and perception among consumers. In June, UGG teamed up with famed fashion designer, Telfar Clemens namesake brand, Telfar, to release the first of multiple product collaborations. The first product drop sold out on ugg.com in just a few hours, but more importantly, garnered positive press with the brand, which included features in leading fashion publications. We are excited to once again collaborate with this exciting designer as we unveiled the second UGG x Telfar product drop in September which will include more footwear and apparel items. From an international perspective, we have been pleased with the progress in Europe and Asia Pacific as the brand is building a younger audience through greater acceptance of the UGG brand's diverse product line. We are gaining confidence in the UGG brand's turnaround based on continued positive response from consumers in both regions. During the first quarter, DTC acquisition in Europe and the Asia Pacific region more than doubled pre-pandemic first quarter levels. And these new consumers are purchasing products such as fluff, sandals and sneakers. With the strong sell-through UGG is experiencing within wholesale accounts, growth in our international DTC business and an exciting spring product innovations to come, UGG is well positioned to continued progress in the spring and summer season next year. Looking ahead to the balance of this fiscal year, we expect UGG to continue experiencing elevated levels of global wholesale demand as we replenish domestic inventories and reignite the brand in Europe and China, maintain positive momentum with younger consumers around the world and work to convert a higher percentage of consumers to repeat purchases across categories, accelerate international DTC demand by showcasing the brand's diversified product offering through localized marketing tactics and mitigate pressures related to lapping heritage slipper demand in the US. Overall, we feel very positive about the UGG brand start to this year and the teams are working hard to acquire new and repeat consumers around the world with bold and exciting products that provide the luxurious feeling above. Moving to HOKA. Global revenue for the first quarter increased 95% versus last year to $213 million. This quarter represented a significant milestone for Deckers and HOKA as the brand's revenue slightly surpassed that of UGG for the first time in the company's history. As has become standard for HOKA, growth was balanced across the brand's ecosystem of access points with all regions and channels of distribution experiencing impressive growth. HOKA continues to build its consumer base through a combination of disruptive product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing and a consistent consumer experience based on the premium quality of the brand's products and distribution partners. Helping to drive the HOKA growth during the quarter, the brand launched an update to its flagship Clifton franchise with the introduction of the Clifton 8. This eighth-generation Clifton features the brand's all-new innovative ultralight midsole foam, which is designed to offer maximum cushion with an energetic response to each step. Consumers have enthusiastically embraced this franchise update, making the Clifton 8 a top 5 style for hoka.com despite only launching in June. Search interest for HOKA in the US continues to expand as the brand experienced a 69% increase versus last year's first quarter according to Google Trends. The Clifton 8 launch helped boost traffic to hoka.com during the quarter. And on top of that, HOKA continues to build awareness with new consumers through targeted digital marketing. During Q1, 72% of online traffic was from consumers who had not previously shopped on the HOKA website. We have been encouraged by the loyalty of consumers who buy HOKA online. During Q1, the number of consumers who purchased HOKA 2 more times increased 46% versus the prior year. Through these repeat purchases, HOKA is expanding closet share with existing consumers as the brand is seeing adoption across multiple categories. To help achieve this goal, the HOKA team is building innovative products in trail, hike and fitness categories. At the beginning of July, HOKA launched a brand-new hiking silhouette known as the Anacapa, which is available in low and mid height. We are excited about the launch of this franchise, which is intended to build market share in the hiking category and attract new consumers to the HOKA brand. This hiking boot features recycled materials, waterproof construction and a Vibram Megagrip outsole, but most importantly, is built with lightweight HOKA technology to feel like a sneaker. Coinciding with Anacapa launch, HOKA has teamed up with non-profit organization Soltrack, to encourage outdoor exploration by participating in the HOKA x Soul Trak Hike Challenge on the Strava application. While virtual consumer touch points like the Strava challenge have been great avenues to connect with consumers globally. We have been excited about the return of in-person events over the last few months. In June, HOKA was a title sponsor of the Western States Endurance Run, which is the world's oldest 100-mile trail race. This event was the first trail ultramarathon to be covered by our live stream telecast with over 30 hours of coverage from start to finish. Congratulations to HOKA Athlete, Jim Walmsley, who are the brand\u2019s EVO Speedgoat trail shoe and adventure bucket hat to win the Western States event for the third consecutive year. The HOKA team's approach to product, marketing and distribution has been highly effective in building consumer awareness and an affinity for the brand. With the brand rooted in performance running, we continue to see higher awareness among those consumers, but recently, the growth of total consumers aware of HOKA has outpaced increases in awareness among runners, according to our proprietary HOKA brand tracking data. We view this as an important positive step in the evolution of HOKA and expanding the brand's addressable audience. For the balance of this year, we anticipate HOKA growth will continue at an impressive rate. They were lower than the quarter just experienced, driven by new consumer acquisition, as the brand expands global awareness, including a key market focus in Germany, the U.K. and China, innovative product updates and increased category adoption from consumers, market share gains with wholesale partners across the globe, greater global brand presence through in-person event sponsorship and higher frequency product drops to maintain excitement with loyal consumers. As we continue to scale HOKA, we are building the right team for the brand's long-term future success. As you may have seen in the press release not long ago, the brand has hired two key footwear design and apparel team members, intended to enhance the evolution of HOKA over the next three to five years. Shifting to Teva. Global revenue in the first quarter increased 66% versus last year to $58 million. What is truly impressive about the standout quarter from Teva is the brand's growth in both fashion with its heritage Universal franchise and function with a more rugged Hurricane franchise. Strength in the Hurricane franchise, we feel, has been driven by the brand's roots in the Grand Canyon, as national parks have seen record attendance this year. From a DTC perspective, Teva delivered solid growth on top of last year's extraordinary increase. As compared to last year's first quarter where Teva more than doubled consumer acquisition, the brand maintained a similar number of acquired consumers this year, increased retained consumers by 41% and saw a 10% increase in average order value among online purchasers. Additionally, growth of 18 to 34-year-old consumers continue to outpace total consumer growth, leading to younger consumers, maintaining the largest mix among all age groups for Teva. For the balance of this year, Teva is expected to build market share with closed to products such as the brand's Ember franchise and increased DTC consumer acquisition and continue to grow the already high percentage of loyalty among 18 to 34-year-olds. With respect to channel performance in Q1, global wholesale revenue increased 140%, as compared to last year. Wholesale growth was unique this quarter, as a result of disruption in the channel last year, refilling domestic UGG inventories that were depleted from record product sell-through and shipping UGG products earlier than in prior years in order to mitigate macro supply chain pressures. As a result, UGG wholesale is up significantly relative to the past couple of years. HOKA also experienced meaningful growth as the brand is building market share and benefiting from the Clifton 8 launch. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, global revenue increased 15% versus last year's first quarter. HOKA drove the majority of DTC growth as the UGG brand was pressured by exceptional demand last year that resulted from the stay at home orders benefiting online sales in the slipper category. Because of the pandemic disruption of both owned and wholesale physical retail locations last year, we experienced a significant increase in DTC mix during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Given physical store reopenings and shifting consumer shopping patterns, we saw a decline of DTC penetration this quarter as compared to last year but have been pleased to maintain DTC mix above pre-pandemic levels. Longer term, our focus remains on building DTC towards representing approximately 50% of our total business. Before I hand off the call to Steve, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of our brand's recent activities on the sustainability, ESG and DEI fronts, which we believe are having a positive impact on consumers' passion for our brands and the culture at the company. Over the past few months, our Deckers Gives program provided meaningful donations as nominated by our employees and community to 10 non-profit organizations championing racial and social justice. We have improved the diversity of hiring with 49% of new hires over the past year coming from by park communities. HOKA received the 2020 Vendor Partner of the Year Award from REI in recognition of the brand's performance and commitment to doing business in the right way, and our employees are close to finishing our first ever plastic-free July competition, which aims to reduce the abuse of single-use plastics. Here at Deckers, we have a philosophy known as Do Good and Do Great, which is a core value that drives and inspires our company and our people to make a positive impact. Our progress in the ESG and DDI space exemplifies this philosophy and our journey continues. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our updated outlook on fiscal year 2022. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, and we are proud to have delivered our most profitable first quarter ever. Our long-term strategies continue to serve us well. We are in an advantageous position with two of the most in-demand brands in the footwear space and considerable opportunity ahead for our brands. While our strategies have helped propel performance, we recognize the existence of unique circumstances that have, in some cases, benefited results and in others put pressure on our brands. Through it all, we remain confident in the strength of our brands our solid operating foundation and ability to remain flexible and nimble in a dynamic marketplace. First quarter fiscal 2022 revenue came in at $505 million, representing an increase of 78% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter aligns with our setup for the year and discussed on our last earnings call, with shipping more products earlier this year as we look to mitigate exposure to supply chain challenges and get product into the marketplace. Q1 growth versus the prior year was driven by the HOKA, UGG and Teva brands. And for the first time, HOKA contributed the largest share of revenue in a quarter at $213 million, an increase of 95%. UGG increased 71% over the prior year to $213 million with global wholesale and international DTC growth offsetting a difficult domestic DTC comparison. And Teva increased 66% over the prior year to $58 million based on the strength of domestic wholesale. Across our entire portfolio of brands, HOKA was the primary driver of growth, increasing 140% over last year, in part due to unique marketplace dynamics which include lapping disruption in the channel last year, refilling depleted channel inventories for the domestic UGG accounts and shipping UGG product earlier than in the prior year to mitigate ongoing macro supply chain pressure and ensure we have product well positioned in the marketplace. Irrespective of these unique dynamics specific to the pandemic, our brands are resonating well with consumers, and we are aggressively pursuing market share where we see opportunity. Gross margins for the quarter were up 130 basis points over last year to 51.6%. The increase was related to favorable brand and product mix as HOKA increased as a percentage of the total company and UGG benefited from earlier HOKA shipments of fall product. A reduction in reserves related to uncertainty in the prior year and favorable foreign currency exchange rates with offsets from channel mix and greater utilization of air freight. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $199 million, up 32% from last year's $150 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by increased compensation related to higher warehouse wages, including hazard pay, onboarding additional talent to scale the organization and long-term incentive performance compensation, reflecting noncash expense. Also, increased marketing to maintain momentum in our brands and reignite international markets for the UGG brand, increased variable warehouse logistics and IT costs with savings related to a reduction in bad debt. Our tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, which compares to 1.2% benefit on last year's pretax loss. This all resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.71 for the quarter, which compares to a basic loss per share of $0.28 in Q1 of fiscal year '21. The nearly $2 increase as compared to last year was driven by revenue growth in HOKA, UGG and Teva, and related favorable mix of brand and product. SG&A leverage as revenue growth exceeded expense growth with offsets from channel mix favoring wholesale and taxes on net income this year as compared to last year's loss. Turning to our balance sheet at June 30, 2021. We ended June with $957 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $458 million, up 5% from $435 million at the same time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $82 million worth of shares at an average price of $329.55. As of June 30, 2021, the company had $728 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Moving to our outlook, for fiscal year 2022, we are raising our guidance to reflect further strength in the HOKA and Teva brands and adjusting our gross margin and operating expense assumptions based on the latest available information. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect a year-over-year top line growth of 18% to 20%, resulting in revenue in the range of $3.01 billion to $3.06 billion, with HOKA increasing its growth rate over last year to be in the 50% range crossing the $850 million milestone. UGG still growing in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Teva now growing in the high teens range. Koolaburra is still growing in the low double-digit range and Sanuk is still expected to be approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is now expected to be slightly below 53%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to pressures from increasing costs related to ocean containers and greater utilization of air freight. SG&A is now expected to be approximately 35% of revenue, reflecting a similar dollar spend as reflected in our prior guidance on increased revenue estimates. Similar to commentary from our year-end call, we expect SG&A spend to ramp throughout the year. The lowered ratio of spend to revenue is related to expected delays in the pace of hiring as the labor market remains highly competitive and more efficient variable marketing spend fueling demand for our brands. We anticipate these adjustments will help offset higher-than-expected logistics costs that are pressuring gross margins, allowing us to maintain prior operating margin guidance of 17.5% to 18%. We still expect a tax rate of approximately 23%. With these updates and the share repurchase executed in the first quarter, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022 to now be in the range of $14.45 to $15.10. As a reminder, during this fiscal year, we are thoughtfully investing to create the long-term future and success of Deckers. These foundational strategic investments include adding logistics capacity with another distribution center in the US and larger facilities internationally; enhancing consumer experience on our e-commerce platform with increased personalization capabilities; improving planning and data analytics with new tools to optimize logistics efficiencies and data insights; seating HOKA and reigniting UGG brand heat in China through localized investments; and bringing in new talent across the organization as we scale, enabling emerging opportunities with added capabilities. And while disruption in the supply chain persists across the industry, we are working hard to mitigate impacts on our brands, including working with factories to prioritize certain products to ensure timely marketplace entry, planning greater DC bypass and collaborating with wholesale partners to get product onto shelves more quickly, utilizing air freight where necessary to maintain strategic product launches and optimizing distribution center workflow to support peak season DTC shipments. While we have tried to incorporate what we know at this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate any further significant supply chain disruption, excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Our teams have a great handle on what is under our control and will remain nimble to react to this dynamic environment. Our brands are well positioned to deliver another fantastic year, despite these challenging circumstances. And I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their tremendous work and dedication to delivering consistently exceptional results. I'm excited for what lies ahead as we evolve our brands and business model to create the future of Deckers. Thanks, everyone, and I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. As we just covered, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, and we are pleased with the result we have delivered despite their macro challenges. We are especially excited about the expanded consumer adoption we are seeing across brands, gender and categories within our entire portfolio. There is a high degree of confidence in our organization about the strong demand our brands are experiencing and our teams are working hard to minimize any macro pandemic-related challenges that persist in the current environment. We are focused on our long-term strategies to increase consumer awareness and adoption of the HOKA brand to build a multibillion-dollar global performance brand over time, enhance the year-round adoption of UGG as a global lifestyle brand with broad acceptance of the brand's diverse product offering, and driving consumers to our online ecosystem to increase our DTC mix to 5 0% of total company revenues over time. We are actively building our workforce and making other key investments in the business to support these strategies now and for the future. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead. \nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. I just want to ask if you can elaborate a little bit on the growth with HOKA. Can you just talk about within the North America market, how much of the growth has been with new products? How much has been the existing products? How much is new doors? How much is just comp in the existing doors, particularly in the wholesale channel? And can you give us a sense of sort of what your expectation was for HOKA growth in Q1 versus where it shook out and sort of how do you see it playing out by quarter over the rest of the year? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thanks, Jay. I appreciate the question. Obviously, HOKA is on quite a tear. And the good news is that, it is absent really any increased distribution. So, we're continuing to sell in the very strategic accounts that we've been in. The only place we're really expanding a little bit is a few more doors and DICK'S going to 40 doors in DICK'S. And then in Nordstroms, we're about 25 doors, but not expected to go until more until the spring. So, the growth that you experienced in the past quarter was driven largely by our DTC business and existing distribution. At the same time, the majority of the business that we're seeing is in core franchise styles such as Bondi and Clifton, but we're starting to see more adoption in for other categories as we talked about in trail and hike. The launch of Anacapa hiking boot has been received extremely well also. So it's broad-based growth across both channels, across franchise styles and extended into new categories. And the demand is just continuing to be super strong. And the awareness of the brand amongst runners is still in the mid-20% and even lower across all consumers. So, what we find is when people hear about the brand and they try it, they're hooked and they're in. So our job now is just continued to increase awareness and adoption of the brand in the existing distribution plan globally. So, we're super excited about how things are continuing to perform. The performance in the quarter, it was in line, but a little bit better than expected, hence the way for the rest of the year. And we're continuing to focus and drive that momentum and continue to reinvest marketing dollars to keep it going.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And Jay, this is Steve. Just to add on to that. The -- so the improvement in revenue guidance that we're now flowing through for the full year outlook, the majority of that increase is coming from the better-than-expected results of HOKA in Q1. And I think as you think about the balance of the year, as we compare against bigger quarters last year, the percentage increase in growth is expected to reduce. Overall, we're still growing significantly with HOKA, but we're going to start lapping bigger quarters against last year. So that percentage growth may decrease. And the nice thing about HOKA is, it's a nice balanced year, right? There isn't the seasonality that we have seen, say, with the UGG brand. So, as you think about HOKA continued growth, a little bit less on percentage terms and a nice balanced year.\nJay Sole: Got it. Thank you so much.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Yes, excellent. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great start to the fiscal year.\nDave Powers: Thanks, John.\nJohn Kernan: You\u2019ve talked about HOKA obviously being, I think, $50 million of the $60 million increase in guidance for revenue, but UGG had a phenomenal quarter in the first quarter. Can you talk to the dynamics of UGG that's embedded in the guidance for the rest of the year?\nDave Powers: Yes, sure. I'll take a crack at it first. So I think, it goes back to what we said on the last earnings call, which was, we were going to shift UGG shipments earlier in the year. And part of the reason we haven't given quarterly guidance, is because we weren't certain of the timing of that. But I think as indicated in Q1, we have been able to ship more in Q1. So that's what's driven significant growth with the HOKA brand, but also within the wholesale channel. And just as a reminder there, the intent there was to get more product out into the marketplace, because we saw disruption within the supply chain. So this was a strategic move on our part to work with wholesale customers to take product earlier than they traditionally do. And this is for UGG, right? This is what's really driving the UGG growth, to your question. So it's atypical in the sense of we're moving more product in Q1 in anticipation of mitigating supply chain disruption. We've been able to move more, but it also aligns with what we said again on the last earnings call, which was, the growth of the UGG brand was really going to occur in the first half, as we were shipping and anticipate shipping in the first half, product that we typically have shipped on a wholesale account basis in Q3. And so that's what's driving the very strong UGG result in Q1. Again, it's not necessarily that we're doing more at this stage, it's more about anticipating supply chain disruption and trying to get more product out into the marketplace to mitigate [Indiscernible]. But it also then allows us to focus on fulfillment of DTC as we get into that [Indiscernible]. So that's kind of the strategy and the growth behind UGG that you're seeing in Q1.\nJohn Kernan: Understood. I don't think that's my line, but one more for me. You talked about DTC going to 50% longer term of the business. We can see from the model that's direct-to-consumer from a contribution margin or segment margin, you want to look at it, up 700 basis points over the last two years, and it's now exceeds wholesale in terms of overall margin. How should we think about the profitability of DTC versus wholesale as the scale towards 50%?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. We haven't given specifics on profitability other than to say our e-commerce channel is our most profitable segment, and hence, our significant emphasis on growing that part of the business and is the big driver of the total DTC growth to get to 50%. So again, we haven't given specifics on that per se in terms of profitability, but it is our most profitable channel and why we are intently focused on driving that proportion DTC as a total of sales to 50%.\nJohn Kernan: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start asking about UGG and some of the seasonal and comparison influence. With the wholesale business, is there a possibility we're going to see similar pull forward from the fiscal third quarter, the fiscal second quarter or with more product now in the marketplace, should we not think about that as an influence? And then I'm also curious, the difficult comparison influence on DTC. Will that continue into the fiscal second quarter and fiscal third quarter?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So Jim, I'll take a stab at first and Dav, feel free to jump in here. I think the HOKA dynamic is a little bit different than UGG. So with UGG, because of the seasonality of the business, it was easy to identify what we traditionally sell-in in Q3 and especially from a wholesale account and how we could identify and strategically move up some of those shipments. With HOKA, what we're seeing is we're shipping to wholesale, but we're also seeing demand increase. And so that's where you're seeing the outperformance and the carry-through and the outperformance to our full year outlook. So there it's about really the success of HOKA driving kind of additional sales that we're seeing in the quarter. What we're more aligned, I would say, in terms of kind of a traditional cadence as it relates to wholesale accounts for HOKA, there, it's about just getting inventory in to accommodate our wholesale dates, as well as some of the launch dates and that is where we are seeing some pressure and looking to expedite and use some of that air freight. So there, it's a little bit about less pull forward, and it's more about seeing increased demand and how we meet that increased demand in the marketplace and bring product in, in an expedited manner to match that demand. And so that's where HOKA is a little bit different than UGG and a little bit more challenged in the sense of how much more can we do given constraints and disruption in the supply chain and how we then work around that with expedited freight. So it's not so much about a pull forward, but it's more about increasing demand and meeting that increased demand.\nJim Duffy: Okay. Related to that, before we get into the DTC comparison dynamic, Steve, the gross margin guidance change pencils to about $20 million. Is that all air freight? Is that how we should think of it?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. The large, large majority. So yes, I think the way you're thinking about it is about right in terms of what we anticipate, I would say, not just airfreight, but kind of all additional costs associated with trying to get inventory in sooner. So it's not solely all air freight, but air freight is a big component of that. We're also seeing increase in other costs related to trying to expedite shipping.\nJim Duffy: Okay. And then the DTC comparisons? Sorry, I know this is stretched to be more than 1 question. It was \u2013 it started as one, I promise. The DTC comparisons with strong slipper sales and so forth. Is that a dynamic you expect will challenge progress in the DTC business in fiscal 2Q, 3Q, or are you kind of through that now, given?\nDave Powers: Yes. Yes. I think it's to call the ball on that right now at this point, Jim. We did see a little bit of that challenge in lapping last year's stay at home orders because of primarily the slipper growth that we saw. I think you're going to still see some more challenges, more so on the UGG side of DTC as wholesale opens up versus last year. But our philosophy is at this point is, we want to be ready in all channels to wherever the consumer wants to shop. And so, we're making sure that we're getting our wholesale inventory levels in line. We're prepared on DTC, both in stores and e-commerce globally. And it's still a very uncertain environment. So, if there are further lockdown orders or the Delta variant takes on a whole new life, we're going to be ready no matter where the consumer has to shop. But we're confident that we'll be ready to meet the demand across all those channels. So you'll probably still see a little bit more pressure on DTC in the short term. But longer term, we think we'll get back to a normal mix and a more increased growth in DTC over time.\nJim Duffy: Thank you so much guys.\nDave Powers: Thanks Jim.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Thank you for taking my question. So I'm just going to ask this. Could you give us what the DTC revenue was by brand for the quarter or the wholesale revenue by brand for the quarter, either way you want to do it?\nErinn Kohler: Hi Sam, I'll take that one. So by brand, this will be global wholesale, including distributor. So for the total wholesale channel for UGG in the quarter, that was $135 million, for HOKA in the quarter, $151 million; Teva, $43 million; Sanuk $10 million; and other brands $4 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. And then 2 other questions real quick. How do you view just the clean merchandise margins? What do they look like? What are you doing with pricing of products? And then do you have any thoughts on M&A, Dave? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yes. The first 1 is on margins and pricing. So as you know, we have a very tight and clean distribution for our -- all of our brands in wholesale, and we're maintaining high levels of full price sell-through. As far as price increases go, we haven't had dramatic price increases this year. The product is on the water, if not already in the DC and in the accounts. The margins of the product, the tier is considered in the guidance going forward with a little bit of hedging for some of the supply chain disruptions. But we're pretty confident in the sell-through of the margin that we're going to have this year. Next year, we are looking at some price increases across the Board on a global level across all brands, it's an exercise. The management team is going to be going through the next couple of months to mitigate some of the potential expense increases that are coming down the pipe and the supply chain. So this year, no price increases, steady, healthy margins is how we're looking at the business. We don't see any real reason to think differently about that. It's more about continuing high premium sell-through and distribution of the brands. From an M&A perspective, we've talked about this before. It's not a major priority for us. We are continuing to have conversations as we have had in the last three to five years. We're not looking at a major acquisition that's going to dramatically change the shape of the organization. We feel we have so much organic growth amongst our marquee brands now, both across footwear, geography, channel and then ultimately with apparel. So we want to make sure we're not taking our eye off the ball, particularly in UGG and HOKA. But at the same time, we are interested in smaller brands, whether they're footwear or apparel that could provide healthy growth in the out years, three to five years from now. It's something that we can incubate, such as we've done with HOKA over the last nine or 10 years. And we feel right now, if we were going to do anything, it would be in that space, a smaller brand, but not a major priority. We're just continuing to have conversations and evaluate what's out there.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much. Continue the success.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Camilo Lyon from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCamilo Lyon: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Dave, I was wondering if, given the consumer data that you're tracking and the work that you do on your own consumers that have come to your channel, have you seen those customers that were new to the brand last year that probably came through and bought slippers, come back this year and buy a different type of footwear products? Have you seen any sort of retention that's come back to the brand?\nDave Powers: Yes, we're definitely seeing that, Camilo. What we talked about in the last couple of quarters is, we're bringing in a younger, more diverse consumer and this is for all of our brands. And then we are seeing more repeat purchases. So the trend that we talked about last year around this time in Q2, where people were coming to the brand and buying traditionally a classic, they're now coming in and buying a fluff or a different category of product for the first time. And then they are coming back, particularly with the fluff franchise we've talked about, there's a lot of newness. There's a lot of excitement. There\u2019s a lot of innovation. And as we expand that franchise to be more of a sandal than a slipper, we're starting to get increased purchases that way as well. We're also seeing really strong results from our loyalty program, and that's driving a significant amount of our sales and repeat purchases. So a lot of our repeat purchases are loyalty members. So what's great is we get these new consumers in, we get them signed up in our loyalty program and then we can cultivate new opportunities across a diverse category offering. So this is a big change from where we've been in previous years, where we now have exciting, compelling product in -- beyond core classics in slippers and sandals and sneakers in rain boots, in fashion winter boots. And we're starting to see those categories really resonate, which is great. And as you know, that's a key strategy of ours is diversify. And then obviously, some strong adoption that we're starting to see with apparel. So what gets me really excited about the UGG momentum right now is that it's broad-based. It's across genders, it's across categories, it's global. And we think that there's a lot more opportunity down the road to continue down some of these new categories and build more of a year-round business.\nCamilo Lyon: Okay. That's good to hear. Thank you for that color. If I could just ask just one more. I think Steve, you addressed this a little bit, but I want to kind of try and pin down and see if you can give us some sort of quantitative benchmarks to help understand the dynamics around slippers. If you could help us understand the pre-pandemic mix of slippers in this quarter relative to what it was last year and what it went down to this year. And maybe help us understand how that will modulate into the next quarter. So just really trying to understand the depth of the comparison that we're facing as we transition into the fall season into a more normalized shopping behavior pattern relative to where we were last year at this time?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, sure, Camilo. And I can give you probably more high level overview rather than specific numbers because it's -- we're dealing with 2 unusual years here. So going back a year ago, right, with the pandemic kind of really taking effect as people were working from home, we saw a very significant increase in terms of the slipper business. And that was largely, again, from a channel basis then driven through our DTC business. So we saw considerable growth with the UGG slipper business. We are comping that growth, but it's also changing because of this dynamic where we're shipping more product early this year. So, it's not a true apples-to-apples comparison. What we can say is that, we're continuing to see growth. Part of that growth is this year that we've shipped some of that product earlier. And so, I think we need to see how the next few quarters play out in terms of that growth. The encouraging news is, it's still a growing category for us, even on top of last year's exceptional growth. But we are shipping some of that product earlier. And so, we'll see some of the growth moderate in future quarters, and we'll have a better read on it as we get through the season. But we're still encouraged by growth that we're seeing in that category.\nDave Powers: Yes -- HOKA franchise is the number 1 style in for the quarter, similar to last year. So still seeing that strong reaction there, a little bit of growth in that style versus last year. But obviously, a very compelling program that we're going to continue to build on and there's still strong demand for it.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. So that's encouraging to hear that. Slippers was part of that big replenishment that you had in this quarter. Is there a way to quantify what the total replenishment was to this quarter, if we separate out just generically spring product sell-through versus reflection? What does that add to the product?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. We don't -- there isn't a specific number to speak to yet in terms of replenishment because it will be dependent on kind of future sell-through too. So, we can't peg to a number at this stage. I would say stay tuned on that. What we are saying though is that the growth, as I mentioned on one of the previous questions that you're seeing in the UGG growth in the quarter, a good component of that is building inventory in the wholesale channel. So clearly, the replenishment will be dependent on what sells through of that. And so that's where we need the next couple of quarters because we are shipping and did ship in Q1 some fall product, right? And this is all to mitigate some of the disruption that we're seeing with supply chain. So don't have a specific number at this stage other than to say, the growth that you're seeing in UGG wholesale in Q1 is really our strategy of getting more product out early to replenish inventory in the wholesale channel, which we've done. We are seeing good sell-through, but some of that product is there rebuilding inventory and then we'll see as we get through the next couple of quarters of how much of that rebuilt inventory versus how much of that sold through. And then we'll be in a better position to say how much is replenishment.\nCamilo Lyon: Very great color. One last one, if I could. Given that it's becoming pretty well known, I think even by consumers that inventories are fairly lean and if you see something may you want and you should probably buy it. Are you seeing that materialize in earlier purchases of fall products?\nDave Powers: I wouldn't say that's necessarily happening just yet. What we're selling is a good healthy mix of spring and summer in fashion, classics and particularly in slippers and the new mill. If we're seeing it anywhere, it's probably in the new mill and the Classic Mini versus previous years, but we're not seeing a lot of early shopping based on inventory. We've been able to maintain a good healthy mix of inventory, the wholesale channels are getting fulfilled again and sell-through is healthy. But I wouldn't say we're necessarily seeing people shop early because they're afraid of not being able to get it.\nCamilo Lyon: Got it. Thanks a lot guys and good luck.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Thank you. I want to ask about HOKA. Steve, maybe first, just when you think about seasonally for HOKA, typically, it looks like the first quarter is among the lowest in terms of the sales by quarter throughout the year. It doesn't look like that's the way you're planning or at least embedded in the guide. So any additional color kind of seasonally how we should think about HOKA and any constraints to growth, if there are any? And then, Dave, when you think about the view to a multi-brand, multibillion-dollar brand opportunity, could you share a little bit more just what that looks like when you think about geography, channel, product? Any sort of color you can on the mix in those areas?\nSteve Fasching: Sure, John. So I'll go first and talk a little bit about HOKA. So you're right. I think traditionally, we've seen Q1 be smaller. That is why you're seeing higher percentage growth currently. So as we see it become a more seasonally balanced brand, that's why you're seeing higher levels of growth in what have traditionally been or historically been smaller dollar a quarter. So with the higher percentage, they're catching up to some of the bigger quarters. In terms of constraints, right now, it's not demand, it's product and getting product in quick enough to fulfill demand. There is demand out there for HOKA, and we're just trying to meet that demand in a constrained environment. And so again, to one of the earlier questions where I was talking about airfreight, HOKA is a brand that we're looking to expedite freight to get it in to meet the demand. So we've gotten a few questions in terms of HOKA, how we clearly, it is a big grower. It's growing very rapidly. The challenge is more just us getting products made into the market. The sell-through is incredible. Pricing is very clean, sell-through is great. We're building the smaller quarters. And so here, the challenge really is just getting inventory in and getting it in time to meet the demand in the marketplace. And in some cases, that's where we're seeing some pressure with the brand. So overall, very healthy, growing incredibly well. We're very pleased with the progress that we're making, and we're just trying to keep up with the growth that we're seeing out there.\nDave Powers: Jon, can you remind -- repeating the question you had about multi-brand?\nJonathan Komp: Yes, yes. I misspoke. The multibillion-dollar opportunity you see for the HOKA brand, Dave, could you just talk about any broad strokes how you view that playing out by channel or geography or even product category? Just trying to conceptualize how you're thinking about the opportunity for HOKA?\nDave Powers: Yes. I think, we think we can surpass the $1 billion milestone with current distribution and current category mix, so heavy on road and trail running, still primarily is our drivers of revenue and growth. So the Bondi Clifton franchises, as an example. Longer term, on a multibillion-dollar opportunity, continuing to take market share from our competitors globally in core run, really expanded outdoor hike business. REI is a great example of the potential there. We're starting to see traction beyond that and stealing market share there as well. From a channel mix -- sorry, to finish also the -- there is also a significant lifestyle opportunity for us, and we're starting to see product in there in that category and seeing success there early on. And I think you'll see spring 2022 and fall 2023, some really compelling crossover styles that are still rooted in performance, but have a broader wearing appeal for consumers. Ultimately, there is an apparel opportunity that we're incubating. As you saw, we brought in a new head it design for apparel, so we're getting serious about that. Broad-based will probably be larger international in the U.S. over time. But that is going to be driven by a healthy mix, probably 50% of DTC and 50% wholesale again and just continuing to increase the breadth of the line and increasing reach, in particular, places like Europe and Asia Pacific with a big focus on China on top of the continued growth in North America.\nJonathan Komp: That\u2019s great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nDave Powers: You bet. \nOperator: The next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I want to ask about the SG&A. I think you said you're looking at dollars similar to how you had previously planned it, but with the better sales. So can you help us just think about the relationship of fixed versus variable in the model? And then, it sounds like maybe there are some areas where you would ramp SG&A more if you could, maybe speak to those areas and what your optimal level of spend would be?\nSteve Fasching: Sure, Janine, I'll take that. So I think what we're seeing and what we spoke to on the last earnings call is a commitment to increasing. So again, last year, I think as everyone acknowledged, it was a unique year in the sense that we saw an acceleration of revenue, and we weren't keeping pace necessarily with investments in a year of uncertainty. And so, we've approached this year much more around building capabilities in infrastructure and marketing for brand awareness, as we now look to continue to grow the organization and grow our brands. And so, you are seeing a step-up and a step up as a percentage of sales. As we've currently guided in that, approximately 35% of revenue, that's a good -- it's a good point to be, we think, for the current year. What we do and are also doing is increasing our variable component of that. And so, with that, we're being very tight in terms of management on fixed costs, which is allowing us to create more variable spend, specifically around marketing and global marketing to build brand awareness. So as we're seeing tremendous growth with these brands, fueling that with marketing to drive brand awareness. At the same time, we are leveraging our fixed costs, which is what you're -- what we're seeing in an overall picture, again, ignoring what happened last year to build that profile. And so, we're very comfortable with that. We like the profile of what we've got in the current guidance that gives us that flexibility. What we are seeing to that and what we've flowed through currently is, we're seeing some challenges with hiring and getting people when we thought. And so, that is some of the reduction that you're seeing in the current SG&A guide versus the prior SG&A guide. That will be something that may change slightly in the future as we're trying to build talent in the organization to support the level of growth that we see in the coming years. So overall, comfortable with what we're guiding this year, more variable to drive marketing globally and brand awareness globally, leveraging on the fixed cost, but also recognizing we're probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be a quarter ago and that's giving us a little bit of leverage in the current year.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I would just add -- sorry, Janine, I'll just add to that, that we're having ongoing conversations about how we're tracking with hiring. As Steve said, that's a little bit more challenging in this environment than we anticipated. So anywhere that we have money that is not being spent on potentially freed up, we're doing our work to reallocate that to marketing dollars to drive the brand -- all brands going forward and also international growth so we can turn these markets around at a faster pace.\nJanine Stichter: Great. I know it's very hard to look out on a multiyear basis now, but you're very much in brand-building mode, especially for HOKA, but is -- do you think the level of marketing spend that you're at now, is that optimal, or could we see that kind of start to moderate as the brand awareness starts to grow?\nDave Powers: I think it's a very healthy rate right now for HOKA. The athletic sector tends to have higher rates of marketing with athletes and events and everything else. So it's working for us. We're continuing to drive it. I don't see us reducing that anytime soon. If we have an opportunity to ramp it up even more so, we probably will because we want to stay super aggressive and competitive here. On the UGG side, we have been increasing the rate of spend over the last 3 years to very healthy and comparable to some of our peer groups. And we're going to continue raising that. But I think right now, we're in a very good spot where we have a lot of flexibility and agility with how we spend our money, where we spend our money by brand, region, channel and type, and we're constantly having conversations with our brand leaders and commercial teams on how we can optimize that. So marketing is a big lever for us. In this environment, we're competitive. We want to stay aggressive and we're going to put as much marketing dollars into play as we can, making sure that we also are building our infrastructure to support the growth that we're driving.\nJanine Stichter: Thank you. Thanks for all the color.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Mitch Kummetz from Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.\nMitch Kummetz: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Steve, on the earlier shipping that you talked a lot about, can you quantify the impact that, that had in the quarter? Your sales were up $228 million. I think you said earnings up nearly $2 from a year ago. Can you parse out the impact on those 2 numbers from the earlier shipping? And then I have a follow-up on UGG?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So Mitch, it's a good question. And we haven't given quarterly guidance. So, what we're saying, and it's probably best viewed through the lens of the change in the annual guidance that we've given. So with increasing revenue, $60 million, what we're saying is what we've achieved, and again, this is largely through HOKA and Teva. That is better performance than what we expected. And that's where we're flowing through it on the year. In terms of UGG, what we're saying is that's largely us adhering to the strategy that we set out at the beginning of the year, which is ship as much as we can, as early as we can. And so that's why you're not necessarily seeing the change in the UGG full year outlook at this stage. So I think in terms of the -- when you look at the change in Q1, we are shipping a lot more than what we historically do. That's not necessarily more business. Some of it is as demonstrated by the performance of HOKA and Teva. The UGG aspect is really more around the strategy of shipping more product early to replenish depleted inventories and set ourselves up for a successful fall season. That's what we're doing, and that's really what you're seeing in the numbers. Because of that outsized revenue increase and largely timing on the UGG side, it's driving a significant profit in the quarter, right? Some of that is getting passed through. But again, not all of it is over performance, it's largely timing of performance. And so best viewed, again, through that lens of compare our full year outlook and there you can identify it. And then just speaking to the other components of the P&L. As we've talked about on previous questions, we are seeing pressure with supply chain constraints and bringing inventory in. And so that is what's leading us to take down our gross margin profile as we expect to incur more costs on that front. And then we're able to offset some of those increases with some leverage in SG&A versus the prior guidance, which is allowing us to hold the operating profit profile, but with the increase in sales driving the lift in EPS that we're also passing through.\nMitch Kummetz: And then just real quick on UGG maybe two quick ones. Just following up on Camilo's question around slippers and I can appreciate all the dynamics there that you mentioned. But I'm curious, the other guide is high singles to low doubles. Are you expecting slippers to be better or worse in line with that? And then maybe a second on UGG. You made some positive comments about men's consideration. Can you remind us kind of where the split is men's versus women's and kind of how the growth rates compare these days?\nDave Powers: Yes, sure. I think from an overall standpoint, right, as I said, we're still looking at growth. Again, it's not on a percentage basis similar to what you saw last year because of the dynamics of last year and what drove the growth there. But the good news is we're maintaining and continuing to build on that growth. And then from a men's shift in terms of percentage of the business, we are continuing to see some increases as we resonate with the male consumer. Yes, we're still in kind of growing above or at kind of roughly around that 15% range, where historically, if you go back a few years, it was probably closer to around the 10% to 12%. So \u2013 yes, in proportion to sale. So not only are we growing the dollar amount, right? We're also \u2013 we're growing the percentage of that business, too. So again, good growth increasing on the mail side. As Dave said earlier, as we're resonating kind of with younger consumers, that includes males and so bringing more new customers into the brand. Dave, did you have anything you want to add on that one?\nDave Powers: Yeah. No, I think that's right. I think what we're seeing in men's, we've been at this for quite some time to make UGG relevant and exciting for the male consumer. The Foot Locker partnership has been a big catalyst for us there, including as well as Journeys. We're getting more penetration in wholesale for a men's product, led by the new mall, but also now adopting some of the slipper products and driving acquisition online in our e-commerce business and DTC business. We have better strength in a place like China, where the penetration of men's is bigger and more broad-based. So we're going to continue to build on that. We're allocating more marketing dollars against the men's opportunity. We feel that, that is a significant space that we can build and take share from competitors in that space and be a meaningful brand for men over the long term. So the progress there is exciting. And we have a new leader in the men's business that joined us during the pandemic, had tremendous experience in the innovation pipeline for product is strong, and we're going to continue to build on that.\nDave Powers: I would say, just in closing, I do want to say that I want to give the management team and the whole organization a lot of credit for the way they've managed the last 18 months. We've been maintaining a very aggressive mindset with these brands. We want to continue to steal share. We want to continue to get -- gain shelf space globally. But the way the team -- the executive team and their teams globally have managed around factory planning, staying aggressive on the buys when other brands are cutting inventory. That has helped us tremendously. We're navigating through a lot of the supply chain issues through earlier shipments, close partnership with our key wholesalers to take product early, super tight marketplace management by our brands were saying clean and premium. And the existing product pipeline and what's coming down from an innovation standpoint is incredibly compelling. So you combine all this with a very purpose-led culture, and there's a lot to be excited about at Deckers, and I'm really proud of the work the teams have done. And I'm very excited about what's ahead of us for all of our brands on a global scale. So we appreciate your time.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for attending the Deckers Brands first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to discuss a strong start to fiscal year 2022 for our portfolio of category-leading brands. First quarter revenue increased 78% versus last year, to $505 million. Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 51.6%, and we delivered a profitable June ended quarter with earnings per share of $1.71. While unique marketplace dynamics contributed to this, we believe the growing influence of HOKA, with its more evenly spread seasonal volumes, will continue to drive our organization toward a more balanced business across quarters. Performance in the first quarter was driven by global wholesale growth of the UGG, HOKA and Teva brands, whose compelling products are continuing to build market share and overcome a disruption in the channel that began during the pandemic. The direct-to-consumer growth in HOKA, as the brand continues to build awareness through digital marketing, introduced innovative products and category disruptors that drive new consumer acquisition and deliver a consistent consumer experience for online replenishment. Additionally, our brands are benefiting from strategic marketplace management globally, which continues to drive high rates of full price selling across our entire portfolio of brands. This quarter represents further progress toward our long-term strategies, which include accelerating consumer adoption of the HOKA brand globally, to build the brand's revenue to $1 billion and beyond, building UGG as a year-round global lifestyle brand through a diverse product offering and executing a digital-first approach by prioritizing direct-to-consumer acquisition online and working towards a direct business that will represent 50% of total revenue for the company over time. While we remain firmly committed to these strategies over the long term, it is important to recognize certain aspects unique to fiscal 2022 related to lapping the pandemic, which is still having varying effects in different locations. Specific to the quarter just completed, we experienced higher wholesale shipment volumes as well as earlier shipments as compared to the prior year. The earlier shipments primarily relate to replenishment of depleted UGG wholesale account inventories that resulted from exceptionally high levels of sell-through during fiscal 2021. These earlier shipments for UGG, combined with strong demand for spring and summer products across our entire portfolio of brands, drove a significant increase in our wholesale business. Given the momentum of our brands and their respective market share opportunities, we are focused on meeting consumers where they want to shop to optimize growth in this less than certain marketplace, but remain committed to driving direct-to-consumer demand over the longer term. Steve will provide more detail around the unique dynamics we are anticipating for the balance of this year, later in the call. For now, I will share more detail around first quarter brand and channel level performance and some context for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Starting with the brand highlights. Global UGG first quarter revenue increased 71% versus last year to $213 million. Performance was driven by strength in domestic and international wholesale as the brand lapped disruption in last year's spring season and refilled depleted domestic inventory that resulted from record sell-through in the prior season. Growth of international DTC, as UGG benefited from localized marketing investments to reignite the brand in Europe and China, which was partially offset by softness in domestic DTC resulting from the decline of extraordinary slipper growth unique to last year's stay at home orders. The strength of Global UGG wholesale resulted from the brand's marketplace management strategies that left UGG with unusually lean inventories entering the year. This positioned UGG to accelerate some woodbefall shipments, helping avoid anticipated bottlenecks in the supply chain and providing the brand with an opportunity to meet in-store consumer demand. We saw this strategy play out effectively as online traffic for UGG was predictably lower than last year's exceptionally high levels, while sell-through at physical retail is strong. With a highly fluid consumer environment, we're managing our omnichannel business to ensure UGG has a meaningful presence with the brand's target consumers' intent to spend. However, we continue to closely manage our product allocation and segmentation strategies to ensure UGG maintains healthy levels of full price sell-through. UGG continues to see high levels of consumer demand as the brand maintained positive mind share with 18 to 34 year olds in the US. According to YouGov, brand consideration among women in this group remained roughly flat to last year's record highs. And among men, UGG brand consideration is at an all-time high. These new levels of consideration among men are leading to the growth of UGG Men's continuing to outpace that of the total brand. Helping to drive more consumer loving connection for the brand, UGG recently held its fifth annual PROUD Prom event in partnership with the Pacific Pride Foundation. This event is an inclusive opportunity for UGG to connect with local LGBTQIA Plus and allied-youth from Santa Barbara and surrounding coastal communities that celebrates identity and love. This year's event featured friends of the UGG brand that included musical artists, Lil Nas X and actress Hari Nef. Further on the brand building front, UGG has continued to engage with brands and designers to create powerful product collaborations that elevate the brand's fashion credibility and perception among consumers. In June, UGG teamed up with famed fashion designer, Telfar Clemens namesake brand, Telfar, to release the first of multiple product collaborations. The first product drop sold out on ugg.com in just a few hours, but more importantly, garnered positive press with the brand, which included features in leading fashion publications. We are excited to once again collaborate with this exciting designer as we unveiled the second UGG x Telfar product drop in September which will include more footwear and apparel items. From an international perspective, we have been pleased with the progress in Europe and Asia Pacific as the brand is building a younger audience through greater acceptance of the UGG brand's diverse product line. We are gaining confidence in the UGG brand's turnaround based on continued positive response from consumers in both regions. During the first quarter, DTC acquisition in Europe and the Asia Pacific region more than doubled pre-pandemic first quarter levels. And these new consumers are purchasing products such as fluff, sandals and sneakers. With the strong sell-through UGG is experiencing within wholesale accounts, growth in our international DTC business and an exciting spring product innovations to come, UGG is well positioned to continued progress in the spring and summer season next year. Looking ahead to the balance of this fiscal year, we expect UGG to continue experiencing elevated levels of global wholesale demand as we replenish domestic inventories and reignite the brand in Europe and China, maintain positive momentum with younger consumers around the world and work to convert a higher percentage of consumers to repeat purchases across categories, accelerate international DTC demand by showcasing the brand's diversified product offering through localized marketing tactics and mitigate pressures related to lapping heritage slipper demand in the US. Overall, we feel very positive about the UGG brand start to this year and the teams are working hard to acquire new and repeat consumers around the world with bold and exciting products that provide the luxurious feeling above. Moving to HOKA. Global revenue for the first quarter increased 95% versus last year to $213 million. This quarter represented a significant milestone for Deckers and HOKA as the brand's revenue slightly surpassed that of UGG for the first time in the company's history. As has become standard for HOKA, growth was balanced across the brand's ecosystem of access points with all regions and channels of distribution experiencing impressive growth. HOKA continues to build its consumer base through a combination of disruptive product innovation, emotionally connected inclusive marketing and a consistent consumer experience based on the premium quality of the brand's products and distribution partners. Helping to drive the HOKA growth during the quarter, the brand launched an update to its flagship Clifton franchise with the introduction of the Clifton 8. This eighth-generation Clifton features the brand's all-new innovative ultralight midsole foam, which is designed to offer maximum cushion with an energetic response to each step. Consumers have enthusiastically embraced this franchise update, making the Clifton 8 a top 5 style for hoka.com despite only launching in June. Search interest for HOKA in the US continues to expand as the brand experienced a 69% increase versus last year's first quarter according to Google Trends. The Clifton 8 launch helped boost traffic to hoka.com during the quarter. And on top of that, HOKA continues to build awareness with new consumers through targeted digital marketing. During Q1, 72% of online traffic was from consumers who had not previously shopped on the HOKA website. We have been encouraged by the loyalty of consumers who buy HOKA online. During Q1, the number of consumers who purchased HOKA 2 more times increased 46% versus the prior year. Through these repeat purchases, HOKA is expanding closet share with existing consumers as the brand is seeing adoption across multiple categories. To help achieve this goal, the HOKA team is building innovative products in trail, hike and fitness categories. At the beginning of July, HOKA launched a brand-new hiking silhouette known as the Anacapa, which is available in low and mid height. We are excited about the launch of this franchise, which is intended to build market share in the hiking category and attract new consumers to the HOKA brand. This hiking boot features recycled materials, waterproof construction and a Vibram Megagrip outsole, but most importantly, is built with lightweight HOKA technology to feel like a sneaker. Coinciding with Anacapa launch, HOKA has teamed up with non-profit organization Soltrack, to encourage outdoor exploration by participating in the HOKA x Soul Trak Hike Challenge on the Strava application. While virtual consumer touch points like the Strava challenge have been great avenues to connect with consumers globally. We have been excited about the return of in-person events over the last few months. In June, HOKA was a title sponsor of the Western States Endurance Run, which is the world's oldest 100-mile trail race. This event was the first trail ultramarathon to be covered by our live stream telecast with over 30 hours of coverage from start to finish. Congratulations to HOKA Athlete, Jim Walmsley, who are the brand's EVO Speedgoat trail shoe and adventure bucket hat to win the Western States event for the third consecutive year. The HOKA team's approach to product, marketing and distribution has been highly effective in building consumer awareness and an affinity for the brand. With the brand rooted in performance running, we continue to see higher awareness among those consumers, but recently, the growth of total consumers aware of HOKA has outpaced increases in awareness among runners, according to our proprietary HOKA brand tracking data. We view this as an important positive step in the evolution of HOKA and expanding the brand's addressable audience. For the balance of this year, we anticipate HOKA growth will continue at an impressive rate. They were lower than the quarter just experienced, driven by new consumer acquisition, as the brand expands global awareness, including a key market focus in Germany, the U.K. and China, innovative product updates and increased category adoption from consumers, market share gains with wholesale partners across the globe, greater global brand presence through in-person event sponsorship and higher frequency product drops to maintain excitement with loyal consumers. As we continue to scale HOKA, we are building the right team for the brand's long-term future success. As you may have seen in the press release not long ago, the brand has hired two key footwear design and apparel team members, intended to enhance the evolution of HOKA over the next three to five years. Shifting to Teva. Global revenue in the first quarter increased 66% versus last year to $58 million. What is truly impressive about the standout quarter from Teva is the brand's growth in both fashion with its heritage Universal franchise and function with a more rugged Hurricane franchise. Strength in the Hurricane franchise, we feel, has been driven by the brand's roots in the Grand Canyon, as national parks have seen record attendance this year. From a DTC perspective, Teva delivered solid growth on top of last year's extraordinary increase. As compared to last year's first quarter where Teva more than doubled consumer acquisition, the brand maintained a similar number of acquired consumers this year, increased retained consumers by 41% and saw a 10% increase in average order value among online purchasers. Additionally, growth of 18 to 34-year-old consumers continue to outpace total consumer growth, leading to younger consumers, maintaining the largest mix among all age groups for Teva. For the balance of this year, Teva is expected to build market share with closed to products such as the brand's Ember franchise and increased DTC consumer acquisition and continue to grow the already high percentage of loyalty among 18 to 34-year-olds. With respect to channel performance in Q1, global wholesale revenue increased 140%, as compared to last year. Wholesale growth was unique this quarter, as a result of disruption in the channel last year, refilling domestic UGG inventories that were depleted from record product sell-through and shipping UGG products earlier than in prior years in order to mitigate macro supply chain pressures. As a result, UGG wholesale is up significantly relative to the past couple of years. HOKA also experienced meaningful growth as the brand is building market share and benefiting from the Clifton 8 launch. From a direct-to-consumer standpoint, global revenue increased 15% versus last year's first quarter. HOKA drove the majority of DTC growth as the UGG brand was pressured by exceptional demand last year that resulted from the stay at home orders benefiting online sales in the slipper category. Because of the pandemic disruption of both owned and wholesale physical retail locations last year, we experienced a significant increase in DTC mix during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Given physical store reopenings and shifting consumer shopping patterns, we saw a decline of DTC penetration this quarter as compared to last year but have been pleased to maintain DTC mix above pre-pandemic levels. Longer term, our focus remains on building DTC towards representing approximately 50% of our total business. Before I hand off the call to Steve, I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of our brand's recent activities on the sustainability, ESG and DEI fronts, which we believe are having a positive impact on consumers' passion for our brands and the culture at the company. Over the past few months, our Deckers Gives program provided meaningful donations as nominated by our employees and community to 10 non-profit organizations championing racial and social justice. We have improved the diversity of hiring with 49% of new hires over the past year coming from by park communities. HOKA received the 2020 Vendor Partner of the Year Award from REI in recognition of the brand's performance and commitment to doing business in the right way, and our employees are close to finishing our first ever plastic-free July competition, which aims to reduce the abuse of single-use plastics. Here at Deckers, we have a philosophy known as Do Good and Do Great, which is a core value that drives and inspires our company and our people to make a positive impact. Our progress in the ESG and DDI space exemplifies this philosophy and our journey continues. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our updated outlook on fiscal year 2022. Steve? Thanks, Steve. As we just covered, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, and we are pleased with the result we have delivered despite their macro challenges. We are especially excited about the expanded consumer adoption we are seeing across brands, gender and categories within our entire portfolio. There is a high degree of confidence in our organization about the strong demand our brands are experiencing and our teams are working hard to minimize any macro pandemic-related challenges that persist in the current environment. We are focused on our long-term strategies to increase consumer awareness and adoption of the HOKA brand to build a multibillion-dollar global performance brand over time, enhance the year-round adoption of UGG as a global lifestyle brand with broad acceptance of the brand's diverse product offering, and driving consumers to our online ecosystem to increase our DTC mix to 5 0% of total company revenues over time. We are actively building our workforce and making other key investments in the business to support these strategies now and for the future. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes. Thanks, Jay. I appreciate the question. Obviously, HOKA is on quite a tear. And the good news is that, it is absent really any increased distribution. So, we're continuing to sell in the very strategic accounts that we've been in. The only place we're really expanding a little bit is a few more doors and DICK'S going to 40 doors in DICK'S. And then in Nordstroms, we're about 25 doors, but not expected to go until more until the spring. So, the growth that you experienced in the past quarter was driven largely by our DTC business and existing distribution. At the same time, the majority of the business that we're seeing is in core franchise styles such as Bondi and Clifton, but we're starting to see more adoption in for other categories as we talked about in trail and hike. The launch of Anacapa hiking boot has been received extremely well also. So it's broad-based growth across both channels, across franchise styles and extended into new categories. And the demand is just continuing to be super strong. And the awareness of the brand amongst runners is still in the mid-20% and even lower across all consumers. So, what we find is when people hear about the brand and they try it, they're hooked and they're in. So our job now is just continued to increase awareness and adoption of the brand in the existing distribution plan globally. So, we're super excited about how things are continuing to perform. The performance in the quarter, it was in line, but a little bit better than expected, hence the way for the rest of the year. And we're continuing to focus and drive that momentum and continue to reinvest marketing dollars to keep it going. Thanks, John. Yes, sure. I'll take a crack at it first. So I think, it goes back to what we said on the last earnings call, which was, we were going to shift UGG shipments earlier in the year. And part of the reason we haven't given quarterly guidance, is because we weren't certain of the timing of that. But I think as indicated in Q1, we have been able to ship more in Q1. So that's what's driven significant growth with the HOKA brand, but also within the wholesale channel. And just as a reminder there, the intent there was to get more product out into the marketplace, because we saw disruption within the supply chain. So this was a strategic move on our part to work with wholesale customers to take product earlier than they traditionally do. And this is for UGG, right? This is what's really driving the UGG growth, to your question. So it's atypical in the sense of we're moving more product in Q1 in anticipation of mitigating supply chain disruption. We've been able to move more, but it also aligns with what we said again on the last earnings call, which was, the growth of the UGG brand was really going to occur in the first half, as we were shipping and anticipate shipping in the first half, product that we typically have shipped on a wholesale account basis in Q3. And so that's what's driving the very strong UGG result in Q1. Again, it's not necessarily that we're doing more at this stage, it's more about anticipating supply chain disruption and trying to get more product out into the marketplace to mitigate [Indiscernible]. But it also then allows us to focus on fulfillment of DTC as we get into that [Indiscernible]. So that's kind of the strategy and the growth behind UGG that you're seeing in Q1. Thanks, John. Yes. Yes. I think it's to call the ball on that right now at this point, Jim. We did see a little bit of that challenge in lapping last year's stay at home orders because of primarily the slipper growth that we saw. I think you're going to still see some more challenges, more so on the UGG side of DTC as wholesale opens up versus last year. But our philosophy is at this point is, we want to be ready in all channels to wherever the consumer wants to shop. And so, we're making sure that we're getting our wholesale inventory levels in line. We're prepared on DTC, both in stores and e-commerce globally. And it's still a very uncertain environment. So, if there are further lockdown orders or the Delta variant takes on a whole new life, we're going to be ready no matter where the consumer has to shop. But we're confident that we'll be ready to meet the demand across all those channels. So you'll probably still see a little bit more pressure on DTC in the short term. But longer term, we think we'll get back to a normal mix and a more increased growth in DTC over time. Thanks Jim. Yes. The first 1 is on margins and pricing. So as you know, we have a very tight and clean distribution for our -- all of our brands in wholesale, and we're maintaining high levels of full price sell-through. As far as price increases go, we haven't had dramatic price increases this year. The product is on the water, if not already in the DC and in the accounts. The margins of the product, the tier is considered in the guidance going forward with a little bit of hedging for some of the supply chain disruptions. But we're pretty confident in the sell-through of the margin that we're going to have this year. Next year, we are looking at some price increases across the Board on a global level across all brands, it's an exercise. The management team is going to be going through the next couple of months to mitigate some of the potential expense increases that are coming down the pipe and the supply chain. So this year, no price increases, steady, healthy margins is how we're looking at the business. We don't see any real reason to think differently about that. It's more about continuing high premium sell-through and distribution of the brands. From an M&A perspective, we've talked about this before. It's not a major priority for us. We are continuing to have conversations as we have had in the last three to five years. We're not looking at a major acquisition that's going to dramatically change the shape of the organization. We feel we have so much organic growth amongst our marquee brands now, both across footwear, geography, channel and then ultimately with apparel. So we want to make sure we're not taking our eye off the ball, particularly in UGG and HOKA. But at the same time, we are interested in smaller brands, whether they're footwear or apparel that could provide healthy growth in the out years, three to five years from now. It's something that we can incubate, such as we've done with HOKA over the last nine or 10 years. And we feel right now, if we were going to do anything, it would be in that space, a smaller brand, but not a major priority. We're just continuing to have conversations and evaluate what's out there. Thank you. Yes, we're definitely seeing that, Camilo. What we talked about in the last couple of quarters is, we're bringing in a younger, more diverse consumer and this is for all of our brands. And then we are seeing more repeat purchases. So the trend that we talked about last year around this time in Q2, where people were coming to the brand and buying traditionally a classic, they're now coming in and buying a fluff or a different category of product for the first time. And then they are coming back, particularly with the fluff franchise we've talked about, there's a lot of newness. There's a lot of excitement. There's a lot of innovation. And as we expand that franchise to be more of a sandal than a slipper, we're starting to get increased purchases that way as well. We're also seeing really strong results from our loyalty program, and that's driving a significant amount of our sales and repeat purchases. So a lot of our repeat purchases are loyalty members. So what's great is we get these new consumers in, we get them signed up in our loyalty program and then we can cultivate new opportunities across a diverse category offering. So this is a big change from where we've been in previous years, where we now have exciting, compelling product in -- beyond core classics in slippers and sandals and sneakers in rain boots, in fashion winter boots. And we're starting to see those categories really resonate, which is great. And as you know, that's a key strategy of ours is diversify. And then obviously, some strong adoption that we're starting to see with apparel. So what gets me really excited about the UGG momentum right now is that it's broad-based. It's across genders, it's across categories, it's global. And we think that there's a lot more opportunity down the road to continue down some of these new categories and build more of a year-round business. Yes -- HOKA franchise is the number 1 style in for the quarter, similar to last year. So still seeing that strong reaction there, a little bit of growth in that style versus last year. But obviously, a very compelling program that we're going to continue to build on and there's still strong demand for it. I wouldn't say that's necessarily happening just yet. What we're selling is a good healthy mix of spring and summer in fashion, classics and particularly in slippers and the new mill. If we're seeing it anywhere, it's probably in the new mill and the Classic Mini versus previous years, but we're not seeing a lot of early shopping based on inventory. We've been able to maintain a good healthy mix of inventory, the wholesale channels are getting fulfilled again and sell-through is healthy. But I wouldn't say we're necessarily seeing people shop early because they're afraid of not being able to get it. Jon, can you remind -- repeating the question you had about multi-brand? Yes. I think, we think we can surpass the $1 billion milestone with current distribution and current category mix, so heavy on road and trail running, still primarily is our drivers of revenue and growth. So the Bondi Clifton franchises, as an example. Longer term, on a multibillion-dollar opportunity, continuing to take market share from our competitors globally in core run, really expanded outdoor hike business. REI is a great example of the potential there. We're starting to see traction beyond that and stealing market share there as well. From a channel mix -- sorry, to finish also the -- there is also a significant lifestyle opportunity for us, and we're starting to see product in there in that category and seeing success there early on. And I think you'll see spring 2022 and fall 2023, some really compelling crossover styles that are still rooted in performance, but have a broader wearing appeal for consumers. Ultimately, there is an apparel opportunity that we're incubating. As you saw, we brought in a new head it design for apparel, so we're getting serious about that. Broad-based will probably be larger international in the U.S. over time. But that is going to be driven by a healthy mix, probably 50% of DTC and 50% wholesale again and just continuing to increase the breadth of the line and increasing reach, in particular, places like Europe and Asia Pacific with a big focus on China on top of the continued growth in North America. You bet. Yes. And I would just add -- sorry, Janine, I'll just add to that, that we're having ongoing conversations about how we're tracking with hiring. As Steve said, that's a little bit more challenging in this environment than we anticipated. So anywhere that we have money that is not being spent on potentially freed up, we're doing our work to reallocate that to marketing dollars to drive the brand -- all brands going forward and also international growth so we can turn these markets around at a faster pace. I think it's a very healthy rate right now for HOKA. The athletic sector tends to have higher rates of marketing with athletes and events and everything else. So it's working for us. We're continuing to drive it. I don't see us reducing that anytime soon. If we have an opportunity to ramp it up even more so, we probably will because we want to stay super aggressive and competitive here. On the UGG side, we have been increasing the rate of spend over the last 3 years to very healthy and comparable to some of our peer groups. And we're going to continue raising that. But I think right now, we're in a very good spot where we have a lot of flexibility and agility with how we spend our money, where we spend our money by brand, region, channel and type, and we're constantly having conversations with our brand leaders and commercial teams on how we can optimize that. So marketing is a big lever for us. In this environment, we're competitive. We want to stay aggressive and we're going to put as much marketing dollars into play as we can, making sure that we also are building our infrastructure to support the growth that we're driving. You bet. Yes, sure. I think from an overall standpoint, right, as I said, we're still looking at growth. Again, it's not on a percentage basis similar to what you saw last year because of the dynamics of last year and what drove the growth there. But the good news is we're maintaining and continuing to build on that growth. And then from a men's shift in terms of percentage of the business, we are continuing to see some increases as we resonate with the male consumer. Yes, we're still in kind of growing above or at kind of roughly around that 15% range, where historically, if you go back a few years, it was probably closer to around the 10% to 12%. So \u2013 yes, in proportion to sale. So not only are we growing the dollar amount, right? We're also \u2013 we're growing the percentage of that business, too. So again, good growth increasing on the mail side. As Dave said earlier, as we're resonating kind of with younger consumers, that includes males and so bringing more new customers into the brand. Dave, did you have anything you want to add on that one? Yeah. No, I think that's right. I think what we're seeing in men's, we've been at this for quite some time to make UGG relevant and exciting for the male consumer. The Foot Locker partnership has been a big catalyst for us there, including as well as Journeys. We're getting more penetration in wholesale for a men's product, led by the new mall, but also now adopting some of the slipper products and driving acquisition online in our e-commerce business and DTC business. We have better strength in a place like China, where the penetration of men's is bigger and more broad-based. So we're going to continue to build on that. We're allocating more marketing dollars against the men's opportunity. We feel that, that is a significant space that we can build and take share from competitors in that space and be a meaningful brand for men over the long term. So the progress there is exciting. And we have a new leader in the men's business that joined us during the pandemic, had tremendous experience in the innovation pipeline for product is strong, and we're going to continue to build on that. I would say, just in closing, I do want to say that I want to give the management team and the whole organization a lot of credit for the way they've managed the last 18 months. We've been maintaining a very aggressive mindset with these brands. We want to continue to steal share. We want to continue to get -- gain shelf space globally. But the way the team -- the executive team and their teams globally have managed around factory planning, staying aggressive on the buys when other brands are cutting inventory. That has helped us tremendously. We're navigating through a lot of the supply chain issues through earlier shipments, close partnership with our key wholesalers to take product early, super tight marketplace management by our brands were saying clean and premium. And the existing product pipeline and what's coming down from an innovation standpoint is incredibly compelling. So you combine all this with a very purpose-led culture, and there's a lot to be excited about at Deckers, and I'm really proud of the work the teams have done. And I'm very excited about what's ahead of us for all of our brands on a global scale. So we appreciate your time."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, and we are proud to have delivered our most profitable first quarter ever. Our long-term strategies continue to serve us well. We are in an advantageous position with two of the most in-demand brands in the footwear space and considerable opportunity ahead for our brands. While our strategies have helped propel performance, we recognize the existence of unique circumstances that have, in some cases, benefited results and in others put pressure on our brands. Through it all, we remain confident in the strength of our brands our solid operating foundation and ability to remain flexible and nimble in a dynamic marketplace. First quarter fiscal 2022 revenue came in at $505 million, representing an increase of 78% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter aligns with our setup for the year and discussed on our last earnings call, with shipping more products earlier this year as we look to mitigate exposure to supply chain challenges and get product into the marketplace. Q1 growth versus the prior year was driven by the HOKA, UGG and Teva brands. And for the first time, HOKA contributed the largest share of revenue in a quarter at $213 million, an increase of 95%. UGG increased 71% over the prior year to $213 million with global wholesale and international DTC growth offsetting a difficult domestic DTC comparison. And Teva increased 66% over the prior year to $58 million based on the strength of domestic wholesale. Across our entire portfolio of brands, HOKA was the primary driver of growth, increasing 140% over last year, in part due to unique marketplace dynamics which include lapping disruption in the channel last year, refilling depleted channel inventories for the domestic UGG accounts and shipping UGG product earlier than in the prior year to mitigate ongoing macro supply chain pressure and ensure we have product well positioned in the marketplace. Irrespective of these unique dynamics specific to the pandemic, our brands are resonating well with consumers, and we are aggressively pursuing market share where we see opportunity. Gross margins for the quarter were up 130 basis points over last year to 51.6%. The increase was related to favorable brand and product mix as HOKA increased as a percentage of the total company and UGG benefited from earlier HOKA shipments of fall product. A reduction in reserves related to uncertainty in the prior year and favorable foreign currency exchange rates with offsets from channel mix and greater utilization of air freight. SG&A dollar spend for the quarter was $199 million, up 32% from last year's $150 million. Higher spend was primarily driven by increased compensation related to higher warehouse wages, including hazard pay, onboarding additional talent to scale the organization and long-term incentive performance compensation, reflecting noncash expense. Also, increased marketing to maintain momentum in our brands and reignite international markets for the UGG brand, increased variable warehouse logistics and IT costs with savings related to a reduction in bad debt. Our tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, which compares to 1.2% benefit on last year's pretax loss. This all resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.71 for the quarter, which compares to a basic loss per share of $0.28 in Q1 of fiscal year '21. The nearly $2 increase as compared to last year was driven by revenue growth in HOKA, UGG and Teva, and related favorable mix of brand and product. SG&A leverage as revenue growth exceeded expense growth with offsets from channel mix favoring wholesale and taxes on net income this year as compared to last year's loss. Turning to our balance sheet at June 30, 2021. We ended June with $957 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $458 million, up 5% from $435 million at the same time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $82 million worth of shares at an average price of $329.55. As of June 30, 2021, the company had $728 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Moving to our outlook, for fiscal year 2022, we are raising our guidance to reflect further strength in the HOKA and Teva brands and adjusting our gross margin and operating expense assumptions based on the latest available information. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect a year-over-year top line growth of 18% to 20%, resulting in revenue in the range of $3.01 billion to $3.06 billion, with HOKA increasing its growth rate over last year to be in the 50% range crossing the $850 million milestone. UGG still growing in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Teva now growing in the high teens range. Koolaburra is still growing in the low double-digit range and Sanuk is still expected to be approximately flat to last year. Gross margin is now expected to be slightly below 53%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to pressures from increasing costs related to ocean containers and greater utilization of air freight. SG&A is now expected to be approximately 35% of revenue, reflecting a similar dollar spend as reflected in our prior guidance on increased revenue estimates. Similar to commentary from our year-end call, we expect SG&A spend to ramp throughout the year. The lowered ratio of spend to revenue is related to expected delays in the pace of hiring as the labor market remains highly competitive and more efficient variable marketing spend fueling demand for our brands. We anticipate these adjustments will help offset higher-than-expected logistics costs that are pressuring gross margins, allowing us to maintain prior operating margin guidance of 17.5% to 18%. We still expect a tax rate of approximately 23%. With these updates and the share repurchase executed in the first quarter, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022 to now be in the range of $14.45 to $15.10. As a reminder, during this fiscal year, we are thoughtfully investing to create the long-term future and success of Deckers. These foundational strategic investments include adding logistics capacity with another distribution center in the US and larger facilities internationally; enhancing consumer experience on our e-commerce platform with increased personalization capabilities; improving planning and data analytics with new tools to optimize logistics efficiencies and data insights; seating HOKA and reigniting UGG brand heat in China through localized investments; and bringing in new talent across the organization as we scale, enabling emerging opportunities with added capabilities. And while disruption in the supply chain persists across the industry, we are working hard to mitigate impacts on our brands, including working with factories to prioritize certain products to ensure timely marketplace entry, planning greater DC bypass and collaborating with wholesale partners to get product onto shelves more quickly, utilizing air freight where necessary to maintain strategic product launches and optimizing distribution center workflow to support peak season DTC shipments. While we have tried to incorporate what we know at this point, our full year guidance does not anticipate any further significant supply chain disruption, excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Our teams have a great handle on what is under our control and will remain nimble to react to this dynamic environment. Our brands are well positioned to deliver another fantastic year, despite these challenging circumstances. And I'd like to thank our employees for their tremendous work and dedication to delivering consistently exceptional results. I'm excited for what lies ahead as we evolve our brands and business model to create the future of Deckers. Thanks, everyone, and I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yes. And Jay, this is Steve. Just to add on to that. The -- so the improvement in revenue guidance that we're now flowing through for the full year outlook, the majority of that increase is coming from the better-than-expected results of HOKA in Q1. And I think as you think about the balance of the year, as we compare against bigger quarters last year, the percentage increase in growth is expected to reduce. Overall, we're still growing significantly with HOKA, but we're going to start lapping bigger quarters against last year. So that percentage growth may decrease. And the nice thing about HOKA is, it's a nice balanced year, right? There isn't the seasonality that we have seen, say, with the UGG brand. So, as you think about HOKA continued growth, a little bit less on percentage terms and a nice balanced year. Thanks, Jay. Yes. We haven't given specifics on profitability other than to say our e-commerce channel is our most profitable segment, and hence, our significant emphasis on growing that part of the business and is the big driver of the total DTC growth to get to 50%. So again, we haven't given specifics on that per se in terms of profitability, but it is our most profitable channel and why we are intently focused on driving that proportion DTC as a total of sales to 50%. Yes. So Jim, I'll take a stab at first and Dav, feel free to jump in here. I think the HOKA dynamic is a little bit different than UGG. So with UGG, because of the seasonality of the business, it was easy to identify what we traditionally sell-in in Q3 and especially from a wholesale account and how we could identify and strategically move up some of those shipments. With HOKA, what we're seeing is we're shipping to wholesale, but we're also seeing demand increase. And so that's where you're seeing the outperformance and the carry-through and the outperformance to our full year outlook. So there it's about really the success of HOKA driving kind of additional sales that we're seeing in the quarter. What we're more aligned, I would say, in terms of kind of a traditional cadence as it relates to wholesale accounts for HOKA, there, it's about just getting inventory in to accommodate our wholesale dates, as well as some of the launch dates and that is where we are seeing some pressure and looking to expedite and use some of that air freight. So there, it's a little bit about less pull forward, and it's more about seeing increased demand and how we meet that increased demand in the marketplace and bring product in, in an expedited manner to match that demand. And so that's where HOKA is a little bit different than UGG and a little bit more challenged in the sense of how much more can we do given constraints and disruption in the supply chain and how we then work around that with expedited freight. So it's not so much about a pull forward, but it's more about increasing demand and meeting that increased demand. Yes. The large, large majority. So yes, I think the way you're thinking about it is about right in terms of what we anticipate, I would say, not just airfreight, but kind of all additional costs associated with trying to get inventory in sooner. So it's not solely all air freight, but air freight is a big component of that. We're also seeing increase in other costs related to trying to expedite shipping. Yes, sure, Camilo. And I can give you probably more high level overview rather than specific numbers because it's -- we're dealing with 2 unusual years here. So going back a year ago, right, with the pandemic kind of really taking effect as people were working from home, we saw a very significant increase in terms of the slipper business. And that was largely, again, from a channel basis then driven through our DTC business. So we saw considerable growth with the UGG slipper business. We are comping that growth, but it's also changing because of this dynamic where we're shipping more product early this year. So, it's not a true apples-to-apples comparison. What we can say is that, we're continuing to see growth. Part of that growth is this year that we've shipped some of that product earlier. And so, I think we need to see how the next few quarters play out in terms of that growth. The encouraging news is, it's still a growing category for us, even on top of last year's exceptional growth. But we are shipping some of that product earlier. And so, we'll see some of the growth moderate in future quarters, and we'll have a better read on it as we get through the season. But we're still encouraged by growth that we're seeing in that category. Yes. We don't -- there isn't a specific number to speak to yet in terms of replenishment because it will be dependent on kind of future sell-through too. So, we can't peg to a number at this stage. I would say stay tuned on that. What we are saying though is that the growth, as I mentioned on one of the previous questions that you're seeing in the UGG growth in the quarter, a good component of that is building inventory in the wholesale channel. So clearly, the replenishment will be dependent on what sells through of that. And so that's where we need the next couple of quarters because we are shipping and did ship in Q1 some fall product, right? And this is all to mitigate some of the disruption that we're seeing with supply chain. So don't have a specific number at this stage other than to say, the growth that you're seeing in UGG wholesale in Q1 is really our strategy of getting more product out early to replenish inventory in the wholesale channel, which we've done. We are seeing good sell-through, but some of that product is there rebuilding inventory and then we'll see as we get through the next couple of quarters of how much of that rebuilt inventory versus how much of that sold through. And then we'll be in a better position to say how much is replenishment. Sure, John. So I'll go first and talk a little bit about HOKA. So you're right. I think traditionally, we've seen Q1 be smaller. That is why you're seeing higher percentage growth currently. So as we see it become a more seasonally balanced brand, that's why you're seeing higher levels of growth in what have traditionally been or historically been smaller dollar a quarter. So with the higher percentage, they're catching up to some of the bigger quarters. In terms of constraints, right now, it's not demand, it's product and getting product in quick enough to fulfill demand. There is demand out there for HOKA, and we're just trying to meet that demand in a constrained environment. And so again, to one of the earlier questions where I was talking about airfreight, HOKA is a brand that we're looking to expedite freight to get it in to meet the demand. So we've gotten a few questions in terms of HOKA, how we clearly, it is a big grower. It's growing very rapidly. The challenge is more just us getting products made into the market. The sell-through is incredible. Pricing is very clean, sell-through is great. We're building the smaller quarters. And so here, the challenge really is just getting inventory in and getting it in time to meet the demand in the marketplace. And in some cases, that's where we're seeing some pressure with the brand. So overall, very healthy, growing incredibly well. We're very pleased with the progress that we're making, and we're just trying to keep up with the growth that we're seeing out there. Sure, Janine, I'll take that. So I think what we're seeing and what we spoke to on the last earnings call is a commitment to increasing. So again, last year, I think as everyone acknowledged, it was a unique year in the sense that we saw an acceleration of revenue, and we weren't keeping pace necessarily with investments in a year of uncertainty. And so, we've approached this year much more around building capabilities in infrastructure and marketing for brand awareness, as we now look to continue to grow the organization and grow our brands. And so, you are seeing a step-up and a step up as a percentage of sales. As we've currently guided in that, approximately 35% of revenue, that's a good -- it's a good point to be, we think, for the current year. What we do and are also doing is increasing our variable component of that. And so, with that, we're being very tight in terms of management on fixed costs, which is allowing us to create more variable spend, specifically around marketing and global marketing to build brand awareness. So as we're seeing tremendous growth with these brands, fueling that with marketing to drive brand awareness. At the same time, we are leveraging our fixed costs, which is what you're -- what we're seeing in an overall picture, again, ignoring what happened last year to build that profile. And so, we're very comfortable with that. We like the profile of what we've got in the current guidance that gives us that flexibility. What we are seeing to that and what we've flowed through currently is, we're seeing some challenges with hiring and getting people when we thought. And so, that is some of the reduction that you're seeing in the current SG&A guide versus the prior SG&A guide. That will be something that may change slightly in the future as we're trying to build talent in the organization to support the level of growth that we see in the coming years. So overall, comfortable with what we're guiding this year, more variable to drive marketing globally and brand awareness globally, leveraging on the fixed cost, but also recognizing we're probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be a quarter ago and that's giving us a little bit of leverage in the current year. Yes. So Mitch, it's a good question. And we haven't given quarterly guidance. So, what we're saying, and it's probably best viewed through the lens of the change in the annual guidance that we've given. So with increasing revenue, $60 million, what we're saying is what we've achieved, and again, this is largely through HOKA and Teva. That is better performance than what we expected. And that's where we're flowing through it on the year. In terms of UGG, what we're saying is that's largely us adhering to the strategy that we set out at the beginning of the year, which is ship as much as we can, as early as we can. And so that's why you're not necessarily seeing the change in the UGG full year outlook at this stage. So I think in terms of the -- when you look at the change in Q1, we are shipping a lot more than what we historically do. That's not necessarily more business. Some of it is as demonstrated by the performance of HOKA and Teva. The UGG aspect is really more around the strategy of shipping more product early to replenish depleted inventories and set ourselves up for a successful fall season. That's what we're doing, and that's really what you're seeing in the numbers. Because of that outsized revenue increase and largely timing on the UGG side, it's driving a significant profit in the quarter, right? Some of that is getting passed through. But again, not all of it is over performance, it's largely timing of performance. And so best viewed, again, through that lens of compare our full year outlook and there you can identify it. And then just speaking to the other components of the P&L. As we've talked about on previous questions, we are seeing pressure with supply chain constraints and bringing inventory in. And so that is what's leading us to take down our gross margin profile as we expect to incur more costs on that front. And then we're able to offset some of those increases with some leverage in SG&A versus the prior guidance, which is allowing us to hold the operating profit profile, but with the increase in sales driving the lift in EPS that we're also passing through."

I am delighted to be here today to discuss another exceptional year for Deckers, as we delivered record results on both the top and bottom line and continued to progress against our long-term strategic initiatives. For fiscal year 2023, our brands achieved revenue growth of 15% on a reported basis versus the prior year to more than $3.6 billion, which is 42% and $1.1 billion above revenue of 2 years ago. Operating margin in line with the high-end of our guidance range at 18%, which is top tier in our industry and a more than $3 increase in earnings per share, representing a 19% increase versus last year. Specifically, our progress in fiscal year 2023 includes HOKA driving global revenue growth of 58% versus last year to eclipse $1.4 billion. UGG revenue holding steady in constant currency, with the brand increasing its mix of both direct-to-consumer and international business; global portfolio DTC adding more than $0.25 billion of incremental revenue, growing at nearly twice the rate of wholesale; and our international markets increasing 20% versus the prior year on a reported basis, which when accounting for an approximate $100 million headwind from currency fluctuations, increased 30% in constant currency. Reflecting on the past few years, our company\u2019s performance is remarkable, particularly given the consumer climate and speed with which we have had to build our infrastructure to support this incredible growth. We still have much more work ahead to build upon the foundation for long-term sustainable growth, but I am truly proud of how far we have come. We believe that the strength of our operations, omnichannel management and brand teams have enabled our organization to improve resilient and capable of achieving the goals we have set forth, including driving significant top line growth, while maintaining an 18% operating margin and reducing inventories to more appropriate levels. I want to thank our employees and our tremendous leaders across the organization for their hard work and collaboration that contributed to Decker\u2019s outstanding execution. Steve will provide further details on fiscal year 2023 results and what\u2019s ahead for fiscal year 2024. But first, I will share more about our 2023 brand and channel performance. Starting with the brand highlights, global HOKA revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 58% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. This is the fourth consecutive year HOKA has delivered revenue growth above 50%. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by a more than 30% increase in global brand awareness in fall 2022; an acceleration of DTC, which grew 85% versus the prior year; broader category adoption; market share growth with existing points of wholesale distribution; and additional access points with our strategic partners, which was complemented by increased availability of product inventory and an improved supply chain environment. In June of 2022, HOKA launched Fly Human Fly, its first-ever globally integrated marketing campaign. The campaign was designed to build awareness and elevate the HOKA brand in the minds of global consumers through rich storytelling and targeted activations in key cities. The HOKA team utilized connected TV and digital and out-of-home channels to reach a broader audience with creative that combined emotionally connected brand and product messaging. As a result of the investments behind this campaign, HOKA awareness increased across a broad spectrum of key markets, such as the U.S., France, the UK, China and Germany, with three of those countries increasing awareness more than 40% compared to fall 2021. Given the success the brand has experienced, we continue to see a significant opportunity for growth in each of our markets over the long-term. Specifically, we are working to close the awareness gap between the U.S. and international regions to build a more global brand. The HOKA marketing team has done a fantastic job developing insights from the initial campaign to evolve the next iteration of Fly Human Fly, which will focus on the brand\u2019s roots and performance through inclusive storytelling that emphasizes the joy of movement for everybody. Stay tuned for more details on the campaign when it launches next month. On the direct-to-consumer business, the HOKA brand\u2019s exceptional growth helped drive a 5 percentage point increase in DTC mix up to 34% of total brand revenue as compared to 29% in the prior year. Importantly, HOKA continues to bring new consumers into the brand, while also retaining existing consumers, evidenced by a 78% increase in acquisition and an 81% increase in retention as compared to last year. Momentum with younger consumers in the U.S. helped drive these increases as HOKA more than doubled the number of purchasers aged 18 to 34 years old. As HOKA continues to expand, we are encouraged by the broader product adoption from consumers beyond the brand\u2019s heritage running styles. We have seen this trend among DTC consumers and continue to gain category shelf space with wholesalers. Among DTC purchasers in the U.S. and EMEA, multi-category purchases increased 79% and 127% versus last year, respectively. Across all channels, HOKA more than doubled revenue on trail and hike products aided by the Speedgoat and Challenger updates as well as market share gains with the Kaha and Anacapa franchises and fitness and recovery products benefiting from greater over recovery sandal adoption and introduction of both the Solimar and Transport Styles. With the success HOKA is experiencing across a variety of innovative products, we are very excited to now offer a selection of our most popular items to the next generation of HOKA athletes with the brand\u2019s recently launched first ever use collection through our DTC channel and with very select wholesale partners. We view the opportunity with kids as an avenue to further expose the brand to parents and younger athletes over the long-term. In terms of HOKA wholesale for fiscal year 2023, revenue increased 47% versus the prior year, driven by market share gains with existing points of distribution, which accounted for approximately 2/3 of global dollar growth, an additional access points with strategic partners. HOKA continues to prioritize delivering a pinnacle experience with performance products with the brand\u2019s exceptional run and outdoor specialty partners, while expanding the addressable market through strategic relationships that broaden brand awareness beyond the traditional specialty consumer. With expanded distribution, HOKA is placing greater emphasis on the segmentation to align product and marketing with the respective distribution partners target consumer. HOKA is leveraging the run and outdoor specialty channel to maintain authenticity and brand credibility by offering exclusive high-performance products that are only available at DTC and select specialty doors. Marketplace management continues to be a top priority for HOKA as the brand enters fiscal year 2024. At the current scale north of $1.4 billion, our focus is to protect the HOKA brand\u2019s premium positioning and maintain a pull model. HOKA plans to emphasize growth in the DTC channel, driving high full price sell-through and building market share with existing points of wholesale distribution, especially in light of a dynamic consumer environment. This focus on marketplace management will be particularly evident in our EMEA region as HOKA expects to prioritize low levels of promotion in the coming year. Steve will get into more specifics on our HOKA outlook later in the call, but I would like to congratulate the HOKA team for delivering another special year and look forward to the brand\u2019s continued success in the upcoming year and well beyond. Moving to UGG. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.9 billion, which is down 3% versus last year on a reported basis, but up slightly in constant currency. UGG performed in line with expectations as the brand focused on driving growth through DTC and international markets, while facing tough comparisons from the prior year related to refilling domestic wholesale inventories as well as currency exchange rate pressures overseas. Despite these unique dynamics, UGG maintained high levels of brand heat and demand, as evidenced by the strength of global DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 16% and 15% versus last year, respectively. While this is a tremendous growth figure in terms of worldwide consumers, we have been even more encouraged by the trends in our international markets, where acquisition was up 29% and retention increased 37% over the prior year. EMEA was the fastest-growing DTC region across the globe, aided by an 80% increase in new visitors to ugg.com in Europe. Helping drive the buzz around UGG, the brand was featured in a number of highly respected fashion publications, including  and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, each touting the brand\u2019s fashion relevance. The UGG team has done an excellent job executing a brand-appropriate collaboration strategy over the past few years, which continues to benefit awareness and increase visibility with target consumers. Most recently, UGG partnered with London-based Gate Brand Palace; LA-based lifestyle brand, Madhappy. And just a few weeks ago, UGG launched an exciting new collaboration centered around the Tasman with New York-based fashion brand opening ceremony. We believe the UGG brand\u2019s focused on winning with younger consumers through strategic collaborations, presence on fashion week runways around the world and product designs rooted in brand DNA have been key drivers of building this excitement internationally and maintaining these record levels of brand heat in the U.S. Reflecting this exceptional demand for UGG, search interest in the U.S. increased 26% versus last year according to Google Trends. Additionally, from a purchasing perspective, UGG continue to over-index with 18 to 34 year-olds, which increased 21% versus last year, outpacing all other age groups and remaining the largest cohort of UGG consumers in the U.S. UGG products that drove demand in this fiscal year included Heritage Classics like the Short and Mini, fashion updates to core styles such as the Platform Classics, new and hybrid styles like the Ultra Mini and Tasman. The popularity of these items reflects the brand\u2019s consumer appeal across an exciting range of products helped by the successful category diversification strategy the UGG brand has been working towards over the last 5 years. Now more than ever, the UGG brand is leaning into its consumer-first approach, sharpening the product lines to create a cohesive consumer experience that feeds product strategy through direct engagement and insights. The brand plans to concentrate on product families featuring recognizable brand codes consumers love and expect from UGG, while reducing inefficient SKUs. Over time, we believe this strategy will drive better margins and greater efficiencies, allowing for more selectful and impactful storytelling across a globally aligned and focused UGG product offering. UGG is now transitioning to the next phase of growth. Over the past several years, the brand has successfully established heightened consumer attention and increased global brand heat through product propositions that are both complementary and counter seasonal to its core lineup. This work increased the UGG brand\u2019s connection with consumers, established a permission to play in new categories and reenergized the love for the brand\u2019s most iconic UGG silhouettes. In fiscal year 2024, the brand is placing greater emphasis on these icons; ensuring inventory is strategically weighted to meet demand for the most popular products and building on its foundation for healthy full-price growth across a variety of category and gender offerings in the future. Overall, UGG delivered a fantastic result given the challenges it faced both in terms of comparing to abnormal shipping timing and volumes and impacts from currency headwinds. The UGG team is developing compelling products through the integration of consumer data and insights within each layer of the product creation process. We are excited for the year ahead as the brand continues to build on the international opportunity and maintaining the exciting momentum the last few years. Turning to Teva. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 12% versus last year to a record $183 million. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth for Teva as the brand continues to be a leader in the sports sandal category with aspirations to become a destination brand for the modern outdoor consumer. We are confident about the opportunity ahead for Teva as the brand works toward future growth through additional investments this fiscal year aimed at driving increased closet share over the next 5 years. From a channel performance perspective, fiscal year 2023 results were driven by strength across our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses, both of which drove more than $200 million of incremental revenue. For the year, DTC revenue on a reported basis increased 21% to nearly $1.5 billion, representing 40% of consolidated revenue. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 23% versus last year, with healthy growth in both the physical and digital segments. Gains in our direct-to-consumer business were driven by the continued momentum of global consumer acquisition and retention, which increased 28% and 29%, respectively, versus last year. We are encouraged that all major regions drove double-digit DTC growth in reported dollars, especially considering the significance of currency headwinds in our international markets. On wholesale for the year, revenue increased 12% on a reported basis versus last year, which primarily reflects global market share gains for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by a reduction of UGG domestic wholesale revenue as we did not repeat the fill-in activity that occurred in fiscal year 2022. The success we are seeing with both DTC and wholesale is a testament to our omnichannel brand and marketplace management. Maintaining the authentic and premium positioning of our brands in their respective markets continues to be our top priority, especially as we navigate an ongoing dynamic consumer environment. With that, I will hand over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2024. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered another outstanding result for fiscal year 2023 with double-digit top line growth, even with substantial foreign currency headwind and once again delivered a high-teen operating margin. Deckers flexible operating model and financial discipline continue to serve us well as we react to a fluid macroeconomic environment. Our omnichannel, brand management and marketing teams have collaborated to create and capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand for our brands, while maintaining the high percentage of full-price selling, leading to record earning levels in fiscal year 2023. Decker\u2019s commitment to long-term strategic priorities, coupled with our execution and financial discipline, are the foundation for success as our portfolio of strong brands continue to drive long-term profitable growth in the years ahead. With that, let us get into a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $792 million, representing an increase of 8% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by continued momentum with HOKA, including the brand nearly doubling last year\u2019s DTC revenue as well as strength in Teva as the brand recaptured revenue lost in the previous year due to supply chain disruption. This was partially offset by a reduction in UGG revenue as the brand lapped abnormal wholesale shipping patterns in the prior year from pandemic-related supply chain issues and experienced more normalized DTC demand. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 50%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year period. The improved gross margin primarily relates to reduced air freight usage, favorable brand and channel mix from the strength of the HOKA DTC business and lower ocean freight rates, which were partially offset by increased promotional activity for UGG as the brand sought to reduce inventory levels of non-core seasonal product and continued headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A for the quarter was $290 million, representing 36.7% of revenue, which compares to last year\u2019s $277 million and 37.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down year-over-year as we gained leverage on marketing, where we avoided spend in areas of over performance. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program, drove a diluted earnings per share increase of $0.95 to $3.46, which compares to $2.51 in the prior year period, representing a 38% increase. With the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2023 results, which includes revenue increasing 15% on a reported basis versus last year to a record $3.63 billion. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by HOKA as the brand added more than $0.5 billion through global expansion across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and benefited from an improved supply chain and logistics environment. Gross margins for the year was 50.3%, down 70 basis points versus last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher levels of promotion and lower-margin closeouts, entire ocean freight rates in the first half with positive offsets from reduced levels of air freight, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue including benefits from price increases and an increased mix of DTC business. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.17 billion, up 12% versus the prior year\u2019s $1.04 billion. SG&A represented 32.3% of revenue, which is 80 basis points below last year. SG&A leverage as compared to last year was driven primarily by lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue as we reduced spending in areas where inventory was short to help offset currency headwinds and delayed some spend targeted to build awareness. This all resulted in a full fiscal year 2023 operating margin of 18%, which is 10 basis points above last year, despite significant currency headwinds. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is above last year\u2019s 20%. Taxes were higher this year, primarily as a result of changes in jurisdictional mix of business. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count that resulted from share repurchase, culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $19.37, which represents a 19% increase over last year\u2019s $16.26. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2023, we ended the year with $982 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $533 million, up 5% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital at approximately 35%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $103 million worth of shares at an average price per share of $421.53. For the entire fiscal year 2023, we repurchased over 900,000 shares for approximately $297 million at an average price per share of $320.35. At March 31, 2023, the company still had approximately $1.4 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect top line revenue of approximately $3.95 billion, representing growth of approximately 9% versus the prior year, with HOKA as our main growth engine, increasing in the range of 20% versus the prior year as we prioritize marketplace management expecting the majority of the growth in the brand\u2019s DTC channel and with wholesale growth assuming no net new doors added globally. UGG increasing low single digits, driven by international expansion and a relatively flat U.S. marketplace as we focus on driving the full price business by maintaining the brand\u2019s pull model. And DTC growth once again outpacing wholesale as we drive consumer acquisition and retention, margin improvement and prioritized marketplace management. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 52%, which is more than 150 basis points above last year as we are anticipating favorability from increasing DTC mix, increasing HOKA mix, with slight offsets from promotions, which we expect to be higher than last year as we anticipate a consumer environment that may have greater uncertainty. Currency and freight are expected to be slight net tailwinds to our gross margin for the full fiscal year, but we expect to see headwind and tailwind fluctuations between quarters when compared to last year. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we reinvest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business, which include talent across the organization, including areas we\u2019ve delayed in the enterprise, supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, e-commerce capabilities and strategic marketing, which includes HOKA spend to grow awareness in leading international markets. Through the reinvestment of gross margin improvements into critical operating expense areas, we expect to maintain an approximate 18% operating margin in-line with what we\u2019ve delivered in fiscal year 2023. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. This all results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $21.10 to $21.60. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, which is above last year as we invest in capital IT projects, retail refreshment, including opening select new strategic locations and bolster our supply chain and warehouse capabilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. With a focus on delivering the full fiscal year, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance per normal course. However, given we are halfway through the first quarter, we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth slightly below the 9% full fiscal year guide as UGG is not expected to repeat the early U.S. wholesale shipments that the brand had experienced over the last couple of years during the first quarter and HOKA international wholesale growth anticipated to be slower due to not repeating the earlier distributor shipments that occurred in last year\u2019s first quarter. Gross margin is expected to be similar to the full fiscal year guided rate and SG&A dollar growth is planned to be up double digits as we anticipate significant deleverage in the first quarter due to the phasing of certain investments. Thanks, everyone. And now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. We continue to remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities and driving progress towards our long-term vision, while actively managing the marketplace for our brands to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, continue to grow the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expand our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive growth in international markets through strategic investments. These strategies, coupled with our disciplined operating model, position us well to drive the development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability as a global organization. Again, I\u2019d like to emphasize some of the points Steve outlined in our guidance for fiscal year 2024. To summarize, we plan to grow DTC faster than wholesale as we prioritize marketplace management and direct-to-consumer acquisition, focus on UGG products with a recognizable brand codes to feed the global momentum with young consumers, continue to manage inventory to align with our consumer demand and invest behind key strategies and infrastructure to further bolster our organization to support our scaling business. On behalf of our entire team, I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and support in helping us drive record levels of earnings in fiscal year 2023. Our results demonstrate the strength of our brands, people and our commitment to delivering value to all of our stakeholders. We are incredibly proud of our accomplishments across the whole Deckers organization and look forward to building on this success in the years ahead.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator:  Our first question today comes from Laurent Vasilescu from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, and congrats on really just another great year. Dave, I would love to ask about your HOKA business, the global potential. I know you gave really good details around channel mix dynamics by quarter. But just maybe for the audience, can you maybe just kind of size up where HOKA is in its international journey? How big is it overseas in  perspective and dollar perspective? I think you mentioned that the growth for 20% assumption for this year assumes no net new doors. But where are you on your journey for \u2013 potentially for China? Would you be open up to working with some local partners there to open up stores? Any color there as we think about focus potential would be great. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. Happy to talk about HOKA. So thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is we\u2019re in this sort of long game, and we feel like we have a very special, very, very strong brand with a lot of runway ahead of it. So in some ways, we\u2019re in no rush, right? But we don\u2019t want to flood the market ahead of demand. We want to control our product experiences. We want to segment across doors and consumers appropriately. And so we\u2019re managing doing this the right way with exceptional growth at the same time. And so I think where the teams have done just an exceptional job, as you know, managing this in the marketplace across all of our channels, balancing the inventories, launching segmenting by consumer, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that.  So if you look at the international growth, certainly, yes, there is more opportunity. I would say we\u2019re still \u2013 I mean, the whole brand in many ways is in the early innings, but international is in the early innings, meaning that there is still a lot of things we need to do to make sure that we are managing the marketplace correctly. We have segmentation across the right doors. In some cases, we \u2013 in certain markets, such as Italy, we\u2019re going to close some doors to have distribution that better represents the brand and working with our distributors to make sure that they have the right presentation of the brand in the marketplace. So if you look at Europe, yes, you\u2019ll probably see some door closures this year, which is strategically done so that we can improve the presentation of the brand and the long-term health of the brand. If you look at a market like China, really early days, right? The COVID pandemic there, it\u2019s set everybody back. It sets our brands back a little bit. I will say they both performed HOKA and UGG better than expected through COVID and some of the investments we\u2019ve made are working well. And particularly to HOKA, we\u2019re seeing solid success and the doors are opening. And we do have a number of partner doors. We have some key partners, some of the best at this in China that work with some of the bigger brands. And I agree with you. I think we can accelerate faster given that we don\u2019t get ahead of demand in the marketplace and that we are improving awareness across these international markets at a better rate. And so that\u2019s really our focus right now is, globally, I think awareness for the HOKA brand is around 24%, certainly lower in EMEA and China, as you can imagine. And so we need to build that demand. We need to build a representation of the brand in front of the consumer and the experience. And we\u2019re really excited about those opportunities, and we see all these markets, including some distributor markets in the Asia Pacific region, as very exceptional growth opportunities for this brand. But as I said at the beginning, we\u2019re going to manage it the right way for the health of the brand, health of the profitability, full price sell-through and consumer experience. So we\u2019re at this for a long time.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That\u2019s great to hear. And then as a follow-up, Dave, I think you mentioned DTC will grow faster than wholesale. Maybe can you a little \u2013 unpack that a little bit more for the audience? Are you expecting that for across your two big brands? And if you have any color just what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. wholesale marketplace, particularly in the run channel, that would be great?\nDave Powers: Yes. So we are very focused and we have been, as you know, in our long-term strategy on building up our DTC business. And we\u2019re getting better and better at it. We have exceptional teams doing this in our industry. We\u2019re optimizing our marketing spend across all of our brands. It\u2019s our most profitable channel. We gain all the consumer data information that we can leverage for lifetime value, expand categories for all of our brands. So when our DTC business grows, we all win, right? And so we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that channel. Purposely, as we look across the marketplace, we want to funnel more of our business through DTC because of the things I just mentioned. And with our flexibility in our model and our ability to spend on marketing and our return on marketing spend, it just makes natural sense that we would drive more business to DTC. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like wholesale and we\u2019re going to pull back from wholesale. We want to be in wholesale in a positive way with the best partners, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, as you know as well. So I think the long-term for this is ultimately get the company to probably around a 50% DTC wholesale mix. We think that\u2019s optimal for our pull model and also for our flywheel of introducing new products to people in wholesale and then having them come into our ecosystem in DTC. That works well for all of our brands. And so you\u2019re going to see both HOKA and UGG growing this year ahead at a faster rate in DTC than wholesale.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Great. Continue success.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Laurent.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Laurent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. \nJonathan Komp: Yes. Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the HOKA plans for the year and any more color to get to the 20% growth rate? What D2C growth you need within that? And then could you just remind us, given the comments about wholesale not growing doors, how did the door growth look \u2013 looking backwards for fiscal 2023? Just trying to understand how next year \u2013 or this year, I should say, looks different than last year?\nDave Powers: Yes. I don\u2019t think we give specifics on the DTC specific growth by brand. But obviously, if we\u2019re growing 20%, I can tell you that the DTC number is higher than that.\nSteve Fasching: DTC is going to be higher than that and wholesale will be lower than that.\nDave Powers: Yes, yes. So \u2013 and again, that\u2019s by design. I think what you\u2019re seeing in net new doors across the chain, part of that is, like I mentioned in Europe. So if you think of that\u2019s a global number. And so we set the marketplace for the long-term, you will have some door closures. And \u2013 but net-net, we\u2019re not planning in our guidance any net new doors. Now one of the things we work really hard to do is evaluate our doors. And so we pay very close attention to the customer experience, the in-store presentation and the sell-through and the productivity of our doors that we carry HOKA in. And so as we look at adding new doors, we want to make sure that the doors we are in are performing at a high level. They are taking share. They are profitable for their account and then we can expand to doors after that. So we\u2019re constantly evaluating that. There may be through the year opportunity to open more doors in strategic locations based on consumer demand and how the economy works. But we don\u2019t want to flood the market, as I said. We don\u2019t want to end up having a lot of promotions. We don\u2019t know want to damage the brand from that perspective. We don\u2019t want to take back inventory and sell it off price. We want this to be a premium brand for the long-term. And so I think it\u2019s prudent, especially in this environment where we have some key accounts who are closing doors that we manage this effectively and planned for a year that is net neutral, but an opportunity for more as things progress.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, that makes sense. And just as a follow-up, sorry if I missed it. Did you say roughly how many doors you\u2019re in and how that changed in fiscal \u201823?\nDave Powers: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve shared that.\nSteve Fasching: We didn\u2019t give specific numbers, Jon, but we did increase number of doors throughout FY \u201823. So we will be anniversary in some of that in FY \u201824. So we will be getting the full year benefit in the wholesale channel related to those stores. So \u2013 but we haven\u2019t given specific numbers. But yes, there was some door growth in \u201823 that will be anniversaried and is shown through wholesale growth in \u201824.\nDave Powers: Yes. And I would also say our productivity in the doors we\u2019re in is very healthy, right, especially compared to some of our peer group. And then just one thing to note about run specialty and outdoor specialty, that is still a pinnacle marketplace for us. And so you won\u2019t see door closures in that segment. Those are super healthy for us, really important for our category expansion and our customer and healthy margins, and we\u2019re continuing to take share. And so that strategy has not changed.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up if I could, Steve, on the gross margin comments. Just \u2013 so it\u2019s crystal clear. Did you say about 52% for the first quarter? And I guess, if that\u2019s the case, usually, it looks like the first quarter is below the full year, typically looking back. So I don\u2019t know if there is something different this year? And maybe more broadly, is there anything that\u2019s holding you back to getting back to that 53% level? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So you\u2019re right, Jon. What we\u2019ve said on Q1 is similar to the full year. Some of that improvement that you\u2019re talking about in the quarter, so Q1 is going to be driven by as we\u2019ve talked about kind of a channel mix and a brand mix with HOKA being the contributor of growth there. So we\u2019re going to get really some benefit there. And then as opposed to last year, we will get some ocean freight benefit in the quarter as well. And then just in terms of further opportunity, I think there it will be kind of how things play out from an economic standpoint, what we have factored in are the improvements from a freight standpoint and the benefit of ocean freight. I think the levers that we will be closely monitoring throughout the year will be levels of promotion. So if promotions are not at a level that we expect, there could be some potential there.\nDave Powers: Marketplace promotions.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, marketplace promotions, and then foreign currency, right? So we\u2019re assuming kind of foreign currency levels at current rates. So those will be the two that we\u2019re kind of watching in the marketplace.\nJonathan Komp: Okay, very helpful. Thanks again.\nDave Powers: Alright. Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading. Please go ahead with your question.\nSam Poser: Thanks for taking my question. Erinn, I have my normal question that I\u2019m not even going to count as a question, and then we can move on from there.\nDave Powers: You want to ask it or you want to just tell you.\nSam Poser: Yes, I would love the breakdown of wholesale or direct-to-consumer by brand in dollars for the fourth quarter, please?\nErinn Kohler: Sure. Sam, I\u2019ve got the full year here in front of me. I\u2019ll give you the full year. You can back into Q4. So for global wholesale and distributor for UGG was $1.004 billion; HOKA, $925.9 million, Teva, $149.1 million; Sanuk, $27.7 million; and that leaves you with other $53.7 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Alright. So now let\u2019s get to it. The \u2013 so number one, the inventory was in better shape than what I anticipated it would be. And could you give \u2013 you gave color on the last call about the inventory when it was high that the UGG inventory was down and HOKA was up significantly to support the sales. Can you, one, give us some color as to sort of what this looks like right now?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I\u2019ll give you and we won\u2019t give kind of numbers by brands, but I\u2019ll give you kind of direction. So significant improvement in the UGG inventory as we did close out some seasonal non-carryover styles within the UGG brand in Q4 that helped drive some revenue, a little bit of pressure on the margin as we closed that out, but really positioned us much better. HOKA, some growth and as you would expect, with the growing brand that we do have with HOKA. So overall, I think the composition of inventory, we are very pleased with. So, given our sales rate growth, supporting a high-growth brand in HOKA, I think our inventory levels look really good for where we stand.\nSam Poser: And then lastly, the \u2013 your guidance for HOKA, interestingly you talked about your marketing spend and how you are increasing \u2013 you are strategically increasing your marketing spend against the HOKA brand. What was the HOKA initial plan marketing or how we want to talk about it in last year? And how much better does the brand do? I mean you mentioned good ROIC. So, how much of this ROIC is built into the guidance for the 20% increase? I believe last year, you started out HOKA at 30% to 35% increase and ended up with 58%. Now, that\u2019s pretty darn good. So, is this \u2013 are you guiding in the same kind of manner you did last year, and we could easily end up seeing 40% here?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I will start. This is Steve. So Sam, I think the way we are looking at it is the growth that we saw with HOKA, clearly, the marketing we did drove demand. And so clearly, we benefited from that. Also, we were coming out of FY \u201822, where we had a large unmet demand with HOKA brand. So, that was driving a lot of the early in the year increases. I think what we saw throughout the year is continued productivity of our marketing spend. That\u2019s where we were able to tailor some of our marketing spend to still achieve that 18% operating margin. So, even in the face of the currency headwinds, looking at the productivity of our marketing, we were able to drive some leverage in that respect. That\u2019s not necessarily how we are looking at it in the same way for FY \u201824. We are looking to continue, as Dave mentioned earlier, to drive international global awareness around the HOKA brand. So, we are looking at increasing. We will see how productive that marketing spend is. Last year was also really the first year we benefited from a global campaign. So, probably experienced improved productivity over that. So, I just want to be careful on assumptions going into next year. But we will continue to invest in marketing. We continue to see high productivity of those dollars spend. We are increasing brand awareness, but we still, as Dave said, early innings and a long way to go here.\nDave Powers: Yes. And the marketing focus, as you have heard from us over the last few quarters right now is really on high level awareness of the brand. So, that\u2019s on an international level. It\u2019s not as quicker turnaround of the return on investment as you see on digital marketing going right to our website. This is out of home. This is higher level connected TV. These things take a little bit more time and need to be consistent and in front of the consumer to get them to then go to purchase. But yes, suffice to say, we are pleased with the direction. We are improving on the initial launch of Fly Human Fly this year, some very exciting updates and focused on a little bit more of the performance athlete in the marketing. And I think it\u2019s going to have a positive impact, and there could be more upside, for sure.\nSam Poser: And one last thing, I mean you stated last year, you talked about building awareness for the brand, and I assume that is sort of long-term marketing dollars, working out for long-term health. But you have got short-term benefits from that. So, in fact, you are guiding the same way that you did last year, and you are not planning for that short-term benefits on the brand marketing. And then I am already got hit by a bunch of people based on one of your competitors. Can you just compare sort of your strategy to this unknown competitor from Europe that \u2013 because I think there is a difference here, especially on the wholesale side?\nDave Powers: Yes. I understand the philosophy or the thinking why people would compare the two brands. They are both new. They are both incredibly high growth, exceptional product, but very different in, I think in the makeup of where our brand plays in a very authentic performance space, both in trail and outdoor and road running, and we are committed to that long-term performance. I think certainly, people are wearing our shoes on casual occasions and for comfort and walking. But at the end of the day, we are a hardcore performance brand. When it comes down to distribution, we are operating in a pull model. And I think that has served us incredibly successfully. I think my background, you look at folks like Stefano and our new President coming from Nike and other companies that have done this for many years, we know how to do this. And we know it works, and we are all committed to the long-term success of this brand and Deckers. And so it\u2019s worked well for UGG, it\u2019s working well for HOKA. We love having demand ahead of supply. I think that\u2019s just the healthy way to run a business. And I think that\u2019s good for a company like ours that we have premium brands and premium distribution. I think if you compare it to other brands, you could look at Underarm over the years or other brands that have grown really, really fast. And a push model is \u2013 it\u2019s a model because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s an approach. And it\u2019s really around maxing out distribution, putting product in front of consumers. There is a big hope there. You are hoping it sells through and you get the reorders in the next year, and you don\u2019t have inventory left over. But we prefer as a company who is really focused on building emotional connection with our brand and growing premium brands, we prefer the push \u2013 the pull model. And we are going to continue with that. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to hold back too much and not be opportunistic and grow as fast as we can. But Sam, we are going to do it in a quality way.\nSam Poser: Okay. Thanks very much and good luck.\nDave Powers: Thanks Sam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Nikic from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nTom Nikic: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on Laurent\u2019s question earlier about U.S. wholesale, I want to ask about UGG. Obviously, UGG has a big department store presence and kind of it sounds like department stores are feeling a little skittish about the macro environment and some \u2013 you also \u2013 we got bad result last week from mall-based sneaker store that has been investing in your brand in the last couple of years. So, just how are your wholesale partners thinking about UGG for the peak fall-winter season this year? And do you have innovation in the pipeline to kind of keep them engaged following some of the strong holiday results you have had in the last couple of years? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thanks Tom. It\u2019s a good question. I think we all realized that last year, we left a little bit of money on the table with UGG. And so all of our accounts, even the mall-based athletic store, could have done more business on UGG last fall. We had a really, really strong success with our Ultra Mini, our Platform Classics, our Tasman, our Tas platform. We left money on the table. The demand is higher than we were able to supply. People still want those products, even though it\u2019s six months later, and it\u2019s a big opportunity for us going into the fall. At the same time, the one thing I would say and maybe a little bit biased, of course, but key accounts, including some of the lifestyle athletic accounts for us want UGG. They need UGG, it\u2019s high price point, it\u2019s high margin, it sells through incredibly well. And so while their overall business may be a little bit more conservative or pulling back a little bit, there is a handful of brands right now that are winning, and UGG is one of them. And you can see it from our metrics around our consumers, our rates of adoption, an acquisition in the 18 to 34 the consumers, the brand heat is stronger than ever. UGG is a very, very healthy brand right now. And because of the work we have done on inventory, it\u2019s a very clean brand in the marketplace. And it\u2019s set up perfectly for fall, where we are going to have inventory in key styles, and that\u2019s one of the things that our new President, Anne and her team have been working on is tailoring the line, making sure that we have a really strong portfolio of heritage classics with modern updates. And the innovation pipeline is really exciting. And so I wouldn\u2019t read into the numbers as there is a challenge out there with distribution. We are worried about the brand. We are going to focus growth into DTC and key accounts, put forward an exceptional product assortment with inventory behind it, and we should have a good season.\nTom Nikic: Great to hear. Thanks very much and best of luck of this year.\nDave Powers: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Nardone from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Nardone: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I would like to go back to the HOKA distribution strategy. First, can you clarify what percentage of your HOKA wholesale business comes from the specialty channel today? And do you still think there is opportunity to take share in that specific market segment? And then I have a follow-up.\nDave Powers: Yes. We haven\u2019t shared how much the run specialty channel is. It\u2019s roughly 1,100 doors in North America, but we haven\u2019t given the mix of business. But it\u2019s meaningful. And strategically, it\u2019s very, very important. And I can tell you that we are continuing to take share. We are not number one yet. And so as long as we are not number one, there is opportunity to take share and we are doing that. And I was at the UGG sales meeting last week that we had was the first one in person in 3 years and talking to a lot of our distributors and some of the accounts that were there. And they are all saying the same thing. They are seeing declines in other brands and increases in HOKA, a little bit less of this case in North America. But that\u2019s how we take share, and we are going to continue to do that and serve that channel with innovation and support.\nChris Nardone: Got it. That\u2019s very clear. And then just in terms of the guidance of 20% range for HOKA this year total, and that includes no new doors. I just want to confirm the strategy with Foot Locker and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Have you talked about how many doors you are in today? And are you still growing in those two accounts, and that\u2019s just not included in the guidance?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So Chris, this is Steve. I will take that one. The \u2013 what we have said, right, we have not named kind of specific partners in the space in terms of number of doors. And so when we say on a global basis, as Dave was talking about before, we are looking across the globe in terms of there will be some accounts that have door expansions, there will have some accounts that may have door contraction. And as Dave mentioned, we are going to look at productivity of doors. So, that doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t going to open new doors. What it means is we may open some doors with some accounts, and we are going to close doors with other accounts. But we haven\u2019t talked specifically about which accounts or which partners, and we haven\u2019t given door accounts by those accounts.\nDave Powers: But I would say, we are very pleased with the productivity we are seeing in both Dick\u2019s and Foot Locker.\nChris Nardone: Alright. Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nDave Powers: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Dave, you talked about DTC and HOKA and DTC growing faster than wholesale. Can you just talk about HOKA stores that you have opened up? I know you have experimented with some pop-up stores and things like that. Give us a sense of what your learnings have been and what your outlook is for the kind of store \u2013 owned store footprint, you think hope you can have over time?\nDave Powers: Yes. Happy to talk about that. We are very pleased with how the HOKA stores are performing. We are in early days of HOKA retail, and we want to make sure that we get the experience right, that our customers are served in a premium way. We have the right assortments. And so when you knew it takes a little bit of time to work those kinks out and create a premium experience. And I think the teams have done a great job on that. We are going to be evolving our store design, which is another important component of store. We want to get that right when we open. And so we are doing a lot of pop-ups in the U.S. to test markets, test appetite, test the experience. We will have our first full-time store soon in New York City. I think some of you guys are going to see that in a few weeks and look forward to your feedback. And then we are looking to do that in certain markets internationally as well. Long-term, we see DTC and stores obviously as an important part of our mix. Retail stores will continue to grow at \u2013 not at a rate above the company but in line with the company\u2019s growth and in line with HOKA\u2019s expansion over time. But we do think retail for HOKA in North America, Europe and particularly China as a place to experience the brand, head to toe and get to know the brand better is important in key markets. And it will be a component, but not a major component over time. That may change as we build out apparel and accessories for the long-term. But at this point, we see it as modifier to our DTC business versus the leader of growth.\nJay Sole: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I can just because you also mentioned that HOKA is still early innings, especially internationally. And at the same time, you are guiding to 20% growth for HOKA this year. I think there is a question out there. Obviously, fiscal \u201823 has huge growth, talking about a little bit of a slower growth rate this year. The question is like, what should investors understand like what\u2019s the long-term opportunity for HOKA? I mean, $1.4 billion in sales at the end of this year. I mean do you see this as a $2 billion brand, is it a $3 billion brand over time? Like I think people are trying to figure out if \u2013 how much of that early innings will translate into bigger sales growth versus sales growth rate that is lower this year than last year? And what exactly we should really be thinking about for HOKA big picture?\nDave Powers: Yes. So, I would \u2013 the thing I would say is pretty soon, we will be a $2 billion brand. We have line of sight for that over the next couple of years, and I think you can do the math and figure that out. And then when you manage that against the level of awareness we have on a global level, it just shows you how much more opportunity we have with a brand like UGG, who is $2 billion already, but their global awareness is much, much higher than HOKA. So, there is just a tremendous white space for this brand to grow if you look at it from that perspective. When we look at how many people still haven\u2019t heard of the brand and what we know about people who do hear about the brand and try it, what that means from a lifetime value perspective, it\u2019s a numbers game. But we do believe that through our innovation engine, through the repeat purchase of our consumer, word of mouth on this brand, desire from accounts who want the brand at a global level. And then you think about category expansion beyond road running, into trail running, into hike, outdoor lifestyle athletics, kids, apparel, etcetera, this is certainly a multibillion-dollar opportunity. And we have a lot of confidence in the product teams and the marketing teams and the global leadership teams that we have established through our omnichannel marketplace management under Stefano and team over the years. Our partnerships with key accounts, we know how to do this. We just want to make sure we do it right. And \u2013 but we certainly see this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity for this brand.\nJay Sole: Got it. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Abbie Zvejnieks from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nAbbie Zvejnieks: Hi. I just have two quick ones. Just on the wholesale growth, I hope that obviously slowed a little bit. I know you talked about not wanting to flood the market. But can you talk about this any impact from more cautious orders from your wholesale partners, just given the pressures consumer discretionary spending? And then can you give a little bit of an update on the apparel businesses at both HOKA and UGG? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Sure. I would say no cautiousness we are seeing. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 if there is any cautiousness that\u2019s in managing their total open to buy and being smart with \u2013 in regards to the economic climate right now. But as far as cautiousness on the HOKA brand, we are not seeing any. And as I mentioned, for our productivity in these doors, our turns or some of the best-in-class, if not the best-in-class in certain run specialty accounts. And so if anything, as we said, there is more opportunity there as we look to expand over the years. But right now, the order book this year, I wouldn\u2019t say there is any cautiousness at all. On apparel, it\u2019s a good question. We have talked about apparel here and there for both UGG and HOKA. I think for UGG, we got off to a good start. And then with new leadership and taking a more critical eye, we want to make sure that we have the right line and the right assortment of products in the marketplace. And so we are taking a little bit of a pause on growing that business to get the assortment right, get the design right, make sure that the lounge collection, has the same DNA as the ready-to-wear collection. If you go into one of our department store partners and look at the lounge product and then you go into our own store, there is a disconnect between lounge and ready-to-wear. So, we want to clean that up. We also are excited about the winter collection that we are launching this year with more cold weather outerwear and product and boots. I think that\u2019s going to be a big part of it. So, what you are seeing now in UGG is really just a reset of the apparel strategy for the long-term. On the HOKA side, as I mentioned, I was at the HOKA sales meeting last week. Our new designer that we hired a little 1.5 years ago, I think in HOKA, this is the first major collection that she has put forward. The response was very, very exciting by the audience there, and it looks really good and there is some innovative pieces in there. So again, this is a long plan for us to think the product that you are going to see starting in fall \u201823 and spring \u201824 and apparel for HOKA is getting better and better, but we are going to start with DTC and a few select accounts and grow and build the demand and then supply the demand as it comes. So, long-term strategy, certainly opportunities in the hundreds of millions for both brands over time, but with new leadership in place and resetting the marketplace, we want to get the product right.\nAbbie Zvejnieks: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, we will be ending today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Yes. No additional comments for us. Thanks for joining everybody and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you as always for joining us today. I am delighted to be here today to discuss another exceptional year for Deckers, as we delivered record results on both the top and bottom line and continued to progress against our long-term strategic initiatives. For fiscal year 2023, our brands achieved revenue growth of 15% on a reported basis versus the prior year to more than $3.6 billion, which is 42% and $1.1 billion above revenue of 2 years ago. Operating margin in line with the high-end of our guidance range at 18%, which is top tier in our industry and a more than $3 increase in earnings per share, representing a 19% increase versus last year. Specifically, our progress in fiscal year 2023 includes HOKA driving global revenue growth of 58% versus last year to eclipse $1.4 billion. UGG revenue holding steady in constant currency, with the brand increasing its mix of both direct-to-consumer and international business; global portfolio DTC adding more than $0.25 billion of incremental revenue, growing at nearly twice the rate of wholesale; and our international markets increasing 20% versus the prior year on a reported basis, which when accounting for an approximate $100 million headwind from currency fluctuations, increased 30% in constant currency. Reflecting on the past few years, our company's performance is remarkable, particularly given the consumer climate and speed with which we have had to build our infrastructure to support this incredible growth. We still have much more work ahead to build upon the foundation for long-term sustainable growth, but I am truly proud of how far we have come. We believe that the strength of our operations, omnichannel management and brand teams have enabled our organization to improve resilient and capable of achieving the goals we have set forth, including driving significant top line growth, while maintaining an 18% operating margin and reducing inventories to more appropriate levels. I want to thank our employees and our tremendous leaders across the organization for their hard work and collaboration that contributed to Decker's outstanding execution. Steve will provide further details on fiscal year 2023 results and what's ahead for fiscal year 2024. But first, I will share more about our 2023 brand and channel performance. Starting with the brand highlights, global HOKA revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 58% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. This is the fourth consecutive year HOKA has delivered revenue growth above 50%. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by a more than 30% increase in global brand awareness in fall 2022; an acceleration of DTC, which grew 85% versus the prior year; broader category adoption; market share growth with existing points of wholesale distribution; and additional access points with our strategic partners, which was complemented by increased availability of product inventory and an improved supply chain environment. In June of 2022, HOKA launched Fly Human Fly, its first-ever globally integrated marketing campaign. The campaign was designed to build awareness and elevate the HOKA brand in the minds of global consumers through rich storytelling and targeted activations in key cities. The HOKA team utilized connected TV and digital and out-of-home channels to reach a broader audience with creative that combined emotionally connected brand and product messaging. As a result of the investments behind this campaign, HOKA awareness increased across a broad spectrum of key markets, such as the U.S., France, the UK, China and Germany, with three of those countries increasing awareness more than 40% compared to fall 2021. Given the success the brand has experienced, we continue to see a significant opportunity for growth in each of our markets over the long-term. Specifically, we are working to close the awareness gap between the U.S. and international regions to build a more global brand. The HOKA marketing team has done a fantastic job developing insights from the initial campaign to evolve the next iteration of Fly Human Fly, which will focus on the brand's roots and performance through inclusive storytelling that emphasizes the joy of movement for everybody. Stay tuned for more details on the campaign when it launches next month. On the direct-to-consumer business, the HOKA brand's exceptional growth helped drive a 5 percentage point increase in DTC mix up to 34% of total brand revenue as compared to 29% in the prior year. Importantly, HOKA continues to bring new consumers into the brand, while also retaining existing consumers, evidenced by a 78% increase in acquisition and an 81% increase in retention as compared to last year. Momentum with younger consumers in the U.S. helped drive these increases as HOKA more than doubled the number of purchasers aged 18 to 34 years old. As HOKA continues to expand, we are encouraged by the broader product adoption from consumers beyond the brand's heritage running styles. We have seen this trend among DTC consumers and continue to gain category shelf space with wholesalers. Among DTC purchasers in the U.S. and EMEA, multi-category purchases increased 79% and 127% versus last year, respectively. Across all channels, HOKA more than doubled revenue on trail and hike products aided by the Speedgoat and Challenger updates as well as market share gains with the Kaha and Anacapa franchises and fitness and recovery products benefiting from greater over recovery sandal adoption and introduction of both the Solimar and Transport Styles. With the success HOKA is experiencing across a variety of innovative products, we are very excited to now offer a selection of our most popular items to the next generation of HOKA athletes with the brand's recently launched first ever use collection through our DTC channel and with very select wholesale partners. We view the opportunity with kids as an avenue to further expose the brand to parents and younger athletes over the long-term. In terms of HOKA wholesale for fiscal year 2023, revenue increased 47% versus the prior year, driven by market share gains with existing points of distribution, which accounted for approximately 2/3 of global dollar growth, an additional access points with strategic partners. HOKA continues to prioritize delivering a pinnacle experience with performance products with the brand's exceptional run and outdoor specialty partners, while expanding the addressable market through strategic relationships that broaden brand awareness beyond the traditional specialty consumer. With expanded distribution, HOKA is placing greater emphasis on the segmentation to align product and marketing with the respective distribution partners target consumer. HOKA is leveraging the run and outdoor specialty channel to maintain authenticity and brand credibility by offering exclusive high-performance products that are only available at DTC and select specialty doors. Marketplace management continues to be a top priority for HOKA as the brand enters fiscal year 2024. At the current scale north of $1.4 billion, our focus is to protect the HOKA brand's premium positioning and maintain a pull model. HOKA plans to emphasize growth in the DTC channel, driving high full price sell-through and building market share with existing points of wholesale distribution, especially in light of a dynamic consumer environment. This focus on marketplace management will be particularly evident in our EMEA region as HOKA expects to prioritize low levels of promotion in the coming year. Steve will get into more specifics on our HOKA outlook later in the call, but I would like to congratulate the HOKA team for delivering another special year and look forward to the brand's continued success in the upcoming year and well beyond. Moving to UGG. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.9 billion, which is down 3% versus last year on a reported basis, but up slightly in constant currency. UGG performed in line with expectations as the brand focused on driving growth through DTC and international markets, while facing tough comparisons from the prior year related to refilling domestic wholesale inventories as well as currency exchange rate pressures overseas. Despite these unique dynamics, UGG maintained high levels of brand heat and demand, as evidenced by the strength of global DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 16% and 15% versus last year, respectively. While this is a tremendous growth figure in terms of worldwide consumers, we have been even more encouraged by the trends in our international markets, where acquisition was up 29% and retention increased 37% over the prior year. EMEA was the fastest-growing DTC region across the globe, aided by an 80% increase in new visitors to ugg.com in Europe. Helping drive the buzz around UGG, the brand was featured in a number of highly respected fashion publications, including  and Harper's Bazaar, each touting the brand's fashion relevance. The UGG team has done an excellent job executing a brand-appropriate collaboration strategy over the past few years, which continues to benefit awareness and increase visibility with target consumers. Most recently, UGG partnered with London-based Gate Brand Palace; LA-based lifestyle brand, Madhappy. And just a few weeks ago, UGG launched an exciting new collaboration centered around the Tasman with New York-based fashion brand opening ceremony. We believe the UGG brand's focused on winning with younger consumers through strategic collaborations, presence on fashion week runways around the world and product designs rooted in brand DNA have been key drivers of building this excitement internationally and maintaining these record levels of brand heat in the U.S. Reflecting this exceptional demand for UGG, search interest in the U.S. increased 26% versus last year according to Google Trends. Additionally, from a purchasing perspective, UGG continue to over-index with 18 to 34 year-olds, which increased 21% versus last year, outpacing all other age groups and remaining the largest cohort of UGG consumers in the U.S. UGG products that drove demand in this fiscal year included Heritage Classics like the Short and Mini, fashion updates to core styles such as the Platform Classics, new and hybrid styles like the Ultra Mini and Tasman. The popularity of these items reflects the brand's consumer appeal across an exciting range of products helped by the successful category diversification strategy the UGG brand has been working towards over the last 5 years. Now more than ever, the UGG brand is leaning into its consumer-first approach, sharpening the product lines to create a cohesive consumer experience that feeds product strategy through direct engagement and insights. The brand plans to concentrate on product families featuring recognizable brand codes consumers love and expect from UGG, while reducing inefficient SKUs. Over time, we believe this strategy will drive better margins and greater efficiencies, allowing for more selectful and impactful storytelling across a globally aligned and focused UGG product offering. UGG is now transitioning to the next phase of growth. Over the past several years, the brand has successfully established heightened consumer attention and increased global brand heat through product propositions that are both complementary and counter seasonal to its core lineup. This work increased the UGG brand's connection with consumers, established a permission to play in new categories and reenergized the love for the brand's most iconic UGG silhouettes. In fiscal year 2024, the brand is placing greater emphasis on these icons; ensuring inventory is strategically weighted to meet demand for the most popular products and building on its foundation for healthy full-price growth across a variety of category and gender offerings in the future. Overall, UGG delivered a fantastic result given the challenges it faced both in terms of comparing to abnormal shipping timing and volumes and impacts from currency headwinds. The UGG team is developing compelling products through the integration of consumer data and insights within each layer of the product creation process. We are excited for the year ahead as the brand continues to build on the international opportunity and maintaining the exciting momentum the last few years. Turning to Teva. Global revenue for fiscal year 2023 increased 12% versus last year to a record $183 million. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth for Teva as the brand continues to be a leader in the sports sandal category with aspirations to become a destination brand for the modern outdoor consumer. We are confident about the opportunity ahead for Teva as the brand works toward future growth through additional investments this fiscal year aimed at driving increased closet share over the next 5 years. From a channel performance perspective, fiscal year 2023 results were driven by strength across our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses, both of which drove more than $200 million of incremental revenue. For the year, DTC revenue on a reported basis increased 21% to nearly $1.5 billion, representing 40% of consolidated revenue. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 23% versus last year, with healthy growth in both the physical and digital segments. Gains in our direct-to-consumer business were driven by the continued momentum of global consumer acquisition and retention, which increased 28% and 29%, respectively, versus last year. We are encouraged that all major regions drove double-digit DTC growth in reported dollars, especially considering the significance of currency headwinds in our international markets. On wholesale for the year, revenue increased 12% on a reported basis versus last year, which primarily reflects global market share gains for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by a reduction of UGG domestic wholesale revenue as we did not repeat the fill-in activity that occurred in fiscal year 2022. The success we are seeing with both DTC and wholesale is a testament to our omnichannel brand and marketplace management. Maintaining the authentic and premium positioning of our brands in their respective markets continues to be our top priority, especially as we navigate an ongoing dynamic consumer environment. With that, I will hand over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2024. Steve? Thanks, Steve. We continue to remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities and driving progress towards our long-term vision, while actively managing the marketplace for our brands to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, continue to grow the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expand our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive growth in international markets through strategic investments. These strategies, coupled with our disciplined operating model, position us well to drive the development of our portfolio of powerful brands while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability as a global organization. Again, I'd like to emphasize some of the points Steve outlined in our guidance for fiscal year 2024. To summarize, we plan to grow DTC faster than wholesale as we prioritize marketplace management and direct-to-consumer acquisition, focus on UGG products with a recognizable brand codes to feed the global momentum with young consumers, continue to manage inventory to align with our consumer demand and invest behind key strategies and infrastructure to further bolster our organization to support our scaling business. On behalf of our entire team, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and support in helping us drive record levels of earnings in fiscal year 2023. Our results demonstrate the strength of our brands, people and our commitment to delivering value to all of our stakeholders. We are incredibly proud of our accomplishments across the whole Deckers organization and look forward to building on this success in the years ahead.  With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes. Thanks, Laurent. Happy to talk about HOKA. So thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is we're in this sort of long game, and we feel like we have a very special, very, very strong brand with a lot of runway ahead of it. So in some ways, we're in no rush, right? But we don't want to flood the market ahead of demand. We want to control our product experiences. We want to segment across doors and consumers appropriately. And so we're managing doing this the right way with exceptional growth at the same time. And so I think where the teams have done just an exceptional job, as you know, managing this in the marketplace across all of our channels, balancing the inventories, launching segmenting by consumer, and we're going to continue to do that.  So if you look at the international growth, certainly, yes, there is more opportunity. I would say we're still \u2013 I mean, the whole brand in many ways is in the early innings, but international is in the early innings, meaning that there is still a lot of things we need to do to make sure that we are managing the marketplace correctly. We have segmentation across the right doors. In some cases, we \u2013 in certain markets, such as Italy, we're going to close some doors to have distribution that better represents the brand and working with our distributors to make sure that they have the right presentation of the brand in the marketplace. So if you look at Europe, yes, you'll probably see some door closures this year, which is strategically done so that we can improve the presentation of the brand and the long-term health of the brand. If you look at a market like China, really early days, right? The COVID pandemic there, it's set everybody back. It sets our brands back a little bit. I will say they both performed HOKA and UGG better than expected through COVID and some of the investments we've made are working well. And particularly to HOKA, we're seeing solid success and the doors are opening. And we do have a number of partner doors. We have some key partners, some of the best at this in China that work with some of the bigger brands. And I agree with you. I think we can accelerate faster given that we don't get ahead of demand in the marketplace and that we are improving awareness across these international markets at a better rate. And so that's really our focus right now is, globally, I think awareness for the HOKA brand is around 24%, certainly lower in EMEA and China, as you can imagine. And so we need to build that demand. We need to build a representation of the brand in front of the consumer and the experience. And we're really excited about those opportunities, and we see all these markets, including some distributor markets in the Asia Pacific region, as very exceptional growth opportunities for this brand. But as I said at the beginning, we're going to manage it the right way for the health of the brand, health of the profitability, full price sell-through and consumer experience. So we're at this for a long time. Yes. So we are very focused and we have been, as you know, in our long-term strategy on building up our DTC business. And we're getting better and better at it. We have exceptional teams doing this in our industry. We're optimizing our marketing spend across all of our brands. It's our most profitable channel. We gain all the consumer data information that we can leverage for lifetime value, expand categories for all of our brands. So when our DTC business grows, we all win, right? And so we're going to continue to invest in that channel. Purposely, as we look across the marketplace, we want to funnel more of our business through DTC because of the things I just mentioned. And with our flexibility in our model and our ability to spend on marketing and our return on marketing spend, it just makes natural sense that we would drive more business to DTC. Now that doesn't mean we don't like wholesale and we're going to pull back from wholesale. We want to be in wholesale in a positive way with the best partners, and that's what we're doing, as you know as well. So I think the long-term for this is ultimately get the company to probably around a 50% DTC wholesale mix. We think that's optimal for our pull model and also for our flywheel of introducing new products to people in wholesale and then having them come into our ecosystem in DTC. That works well for all of our brands. And so you're going to see both HOKA and UGG growing this year ahead at a faster rate in DTC than wholesale. Thanks, Laurent. Yes. I don't think we give specifics on the DTC specific growth by brand. But obviously, if we're growing 20%, I can tell you that the DTC number is higher than that. Yes, yes. So \u2013 and again, that's by design. I think what you're seeing in net new doors across the chain, part of that is, like I mentioned in Europe. So if you think of that's a global number. And so we set the marketplace for the long-term, you will have some door closures. And \u2013 but net-net, we're not planning in our guidance any net new doors. Now one of the things we work really hard to do is evaluate our doors. And so we pay very close attention to the customer experience, the in-store presentation and the sell-through and the productivity of our doors that we carry HOKA in. And so as we look at adding new doors, we want to make sure that the doors we are in are performing at a high level. They are taking share. They are profitable for their account and then we can expand to doors after that. So we're constantly evaluating that. There may be through the year opportunity to open more doors in strategic locations based on consumer demand and how the economy works. But we don't want to flood the market, as I said. We don't want to end up having a lot of promotions. We don't know want to damage the brand from that perspective. We don't want to take back inventory and sell it off price. We want this to be a premium brand for the long-term. And so I think it's prudent, especially in this environment where we have some key accounts who are closing doors that we manage this effectively and planned for a year that is net neutral, but an opportunity for more as things progress. I don't think we've shared that. Yes. And I would also say our productivity in the doors we're in is very healthy, right, especially compared to some of our peer group. And then just one thing to note about run specialty and outdoor specialty, that is still a pinnacle marketplace for us. And so you won't see door closures in that segment. Those are super healthy for us, really important for our category expansion and our customer and healthy margins, and we're continuing to take share. And so that strategy has not changed. Marketplace promotions. Alright. Thanks, Jon. You want to ask it or you want to just tell you. Yes. And the marketing focus, as you have heard from us over the last few quarters right now is really on high level awareness of the brand. So, that's on an international level. It's not as quicker turnaround of the return on investment as you see on digital marketing going right to our website. This is out of home. This is higher level connected TV. These things take a little bit more time and need to be consistent and in front of the consumer to get them to then go to purchase. But yes, suffice to say, we are pleased with the direction. We are improving on the initial launch of Fly Human Fly this year, some very exciting updates and focused on a little bit more of the performance athlete in the marketing. And I think it's going to have a positive impact, and there could be more upside, for sure. Yes. I understand the philosophy or the thinking why people would compare the two brands. They are both new. They are both incredibly high growth, exceptional product, but very different in, I think in the makeup of where our brand plays in a very authentic performance space, both in trail and outdoor and road running, and we are committed to that long-term performance. I think certainly, people are wearing our shoes on casual occasions and for comfort and walking. But at the end of the day, we are a hardcore performance brand. When it comes down to distribution, we are operating in a pull model. And I think that has served us incredibly successfully. I think my background, you look at folks like Stefano and our new President coming from Nike and other companies that have done this for many years, we know how to do this. And we know it works, and we are all committed to the long-term success of this brand and Deckers. And so it's worked well for UGG, it's working well for HOKA. We love having demand ahead of supply. I think that's just the healthy way to run a business. And I think that's good for a company like ours that we have premium brands and premium distribution. I think if you compare it to other brands, you could look at Underarm over the years or other brands that have grown really, really fast. And a push model is \u2013 it's a model because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it's an approach. And it's really around maxing out distribution, putting product in front of consumers. There is a big hope there. You are hoping it sells through and you get the reorders in the next year, and you don't have inventory left over. But we prefer as a company who is really focused on building emotional connection with our brand and growing premium brands, we prefer the push \u2013 the pull model. And we are going to continue with that. Now, it doesn't mean we are going to hold back too much and not be opportunistic and grow as fast as we can. But Sam, we are going to do it in a quality way. Thanks Sam. Yes. Thanks Tom. It's a good question. I think we all realized that last year, we left a little bit of money on the table with UGG. And so all of our accounts, even the mall-based athletic store, could have done more business on UGG last fall. We had a really, really strong success with our Ultra Mini, our Platform Classics, our Tasman, our Tas platform. We left money on the table. The demand is higher than we were able to supply. People still want those products, even though it's six months later, and it's a big opportunity for us going into the fall. At the same time, the one thing I would say and maybe a little bit biased, of course, but key accounts, including some of the lifestyle athletic accounts for us want UGG. They need UGG, it's high price point, it's high margin, it sells through incredibly well. And so while their overall business may be a little bit more conservative or pulling back a little bit, there is a handful of brands right now that are winning, and UGG is one of them. And you can see it from our metrics around our consumers, our rates of adoption, an acquisition in the 18 to 34 the consumers, the brand heat is stronger than ever. UGG is a very, very healthy brand right now. And because of the work we have done on inventory, it's a very clean brand in the marketplace. And it's set up perfectly for fall, where we are going to have inventory in key styles, and that's one of the things that our new President, Anne and her team have been working on is tailoring the line, making sure that we have a really strong portfolio of heritage classics with modern updates. And the innovation pipeline is really exciting. And so I wouldn't read into the numbers as there is a challenge out there with distribution. We are worried about the brand. We are going to focus growth into DTC and key accounts, put forward an exceptional product assortment with inventory behind it, and we should have a good season. Thanks Tom. Yes. We haven't shared how much the run specialty channel is. It's roughly 1,100 doors in North America, but we haven't given the mix of business. But it's meaningful. And strategically, it's very, very important. And I can tell you that we are continuing to take share. We are not number one yet. And so as long as we are not number one, there is opportunity to take share and we are doing that. And I was at the UGG sales meeting last week that we had was the first one in person in 3 years and talking to a lot of our distributors and some of the accounts that were there. And they are all saying the same thing. They are seeing declines in other brands and increases in HOKA, a little bit less of this case in North America. But that's how we take share, and we are going to continue to do that and serve that channel with innovation and support. But I would say, we are very pleased with the productivity we are seeing in both Dick's and Foot Locker. Thanks Chris. Yes. Happy to talk about that. We are very pleased with how the HOKA stores are performing. We are in early days of HOKA retail, and we want to make sure that we get the experience right, that our customers are served in a premium way. We have the right assortments. And so when you knew it takes a little bit of time to work those kinks out and create a premium experience. And I think the teams have done a great job on that. We are going to be evolving our store design, which is another important component of store. We want to get that right when we open. And so we are doing a lot of pop-ups in the U.S. to test markets, test appetite, test the experience. We will have our first full-time store soon in New York City. I think some of you guys are going to see that in a few weeks and look forward to your feedback. And then we are looking to do that in certain markets internationally as well. Long-term, we see DTC and stores obviously as an important part of our mix. Retail stores will continue to grow at \u2013 not at a rate above the company but in line with the company's growth and in line with HOKA's expansion over time. But we do think retail for HOKA in North America, Europe and particularly China as a place to experience the brand, head to toe and get to know the brand better is important in key markets. And it will be a component, but not a major component over time. That may change as we build out apparel and accessories for the long-term. But at this point, we see it as modifier to our DTC business versus the leader of growth. Yes. So, I would \u2013 the thing I would say is pretty soon, we will be a $2 billion brand. We have line of sight for that over the next couple of years, and I think you can do the math and figure that out. And then when you manage that against the level of awareness we have on a global level, it just shows you how much more opportunity we have with a brand like UGG, who is $2 billion already, but their global awareness is much, much higher than HOKA. So, there is just a tremendous white space for this brand to grow if you look at it from that perspective. When we look at how many people still haven't heard of the brand and what we know about people who do hear about the brand and try it, what that means from a lifetime value perspective, it's a numbers game. But we do believe that through our innovation engine, through the repeat purchase of our consumer, word of mouth on this brand, desire from accounts who want the brand at a global level. And then you think about category expansion beyond road running, into trail running, into hike, outdoor lifestyle athletics, kids, apparel, etcetera, this is certainly a multibillion-dollar opportunity. And we have a lot of confidence in the product teams and the marketing teams and the global leadership teams that we have established through our omnichannel marketplace management under Stefano and team over the years. Our partnerships with key accounts, we know how to do this. We just want to make sure we do it right. And \u2013 but we certainly see this as a multibillion-dollar opportunity for this brand. You bet. Sure. I would say no cautiousness we are seeing. So, it's really \u2013 if there is any cautiousness that's in managing their total open to buy and being smart with \u2013 in regards to the economic climate right now. But as far as cautiousness on the HOKA brand, we are not seeing any. And as I mentioned, for our productivity in these doors, our turns or some of the best-in-class, if not the best-in-class in certain run specialty accounts. And so if anything, as we said, there is more opportunity there as we look to expand over the years. But right now, the order book this year, I wouldn't say there is any cautiousness at all. On apparel, it's a good question. We have talked about apparel here and there for both UGG and HOKA. I think for UGG, we got off to a good start. And then with new leadership and taking a more critical eye, we want to make sure that we have the right line and the right assortment of products in the marketplace. And so we are taking a little bit of a pause on growing that business to get the assortment right, get the design right, make sure that the lounge collection, has the same DNA as the ready-to-wear collection. If you go into one of our department store partners and look at the lounge product and then you go into our own store, there is a disconnect between lounge and ready-to-wear. So, we want to clean that up. We also are excited about the winter collection that we are launching this year with more cold weather outerwear and product and boots. I think that's going to be a big part of it. So, what you are seeing now in UGG is really just a reset of the apparel strategy for the long-term. On the HOKA side, as I mentioned, I was at the HOKA sales meeting last week. Our new designer that we hired a little 1.5 years ago, I think in HOKA, this is the first major collection that she has put forward. The response was very, very exciting by the audience there, and it looks really good and there is some innovative pieces in there. So again, this is a long plan for us to think the product that you are going to see starting in fall \u201823 and spring \u201824 and apparel for HOKA is getting better and better, but we are going to start with DTC and a few select accounts and grow and build the demand and then supply the demand as it comes. So, long-term strategy, certainly opportunities in the hundreds of millions for both brands over time, but with new leadership in place and resetting the marketplace, we want to get the product right. Thank you. Yes. No additional comments for us. Thanks for joining everybody and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered another outstanding result for fiscal year 2023 with double-digit top line growth, even with substantial foreign currency headwind and once again delivered a high-teen operating margin. Deckers flexible operating model and financial discipline continue to serve us well as we react to a fluid macroeconomic environment. Our omnichannel, brand management and marketing teams have collaborated to create and capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand for our brands, while maintaining the high percentage of full-price selling, leading to record earning levels in fiscal year 2023. Decker's commitment to long-term strategic priorities, coupled with our execution and financial discipline, are the foundation for success as our portfolio of strong brands continue to drive long-term profitable growth in the years ahead. With that, let us get into a recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $792 million, representing an increase of 8% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by continued momentum with HOKA, including the brand nearly doubling last year's DTC revenue as well as strength in Teva as the brand recaptured revenue lost in the previous year due to supply chain disruption. This was partially offset by a reduction in UGG revenue as the brand lapped abnormal wholesale shipping patterns in the prior year from pandemic-related supply chain issues and experienced more normalized DTC demand. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 50%, a 130 basis point increase from the prior year period. The improved gross margin primarily relates to reduced air freight usage, favorable brand and channel mix from the strength of the HOKA DTC business and lower ocean freight rates, which were partially offset by increased promotional activity for UGG as the brand sought to reduce inventory levels of non-core seasonal product and continued headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A for the quarter was $290 million, representing 36.7% of revenue, which compares to last year's $277 million and 37.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down year-over-year as we gained leverage on marketing, where we avoided spend in areas of over performance. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program, drove a diluted earnings per share increase of $0.95 to $3.46, which compares to $2.51 in the prior year period, representing a 38% increase. With the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2023 results, which includes revenue increasing 15% on a reported basis versus last year to a record $3.63 billion. As compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by HOKA as the brand added more than $0.5 billion through global expansion across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and benefited from an improved supply chain and logistics environment. Gross margins for the year was 50.3%, down 70 basis points versus last year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, higher levels of promotion and lower-margin closeouts, entire ocean freight rates in the first half with positive offsets from reduced levels of air freight, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue including benefits from price increases and an increased mix of DTC business. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.17 billion, up 12% versus the prior year's $1.04 billion. SG&A represented 32.3% of revenue, which is 80 basis points below last year. SG&A leverage as compared to last year was driven primarily by lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue as we reduced spending in areas where inventory was short to help offset currency headwinds and delayed some spend targeted to build awareness. This all resulted in a full fiscal year 2023 operating margin of 18%, which is 10 basis points above last year, despite significant currency headwinds. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is above last year's 20%. Taxes were higher this year, primarily as a result of changes in jurisdictional mix of business. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count that resulted from share repurchase, culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $19.37, which represents a 19% increase over last year's $16.26. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2023, we ended the year with $982 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $533 million, up 5% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. For the year, these results returned invested capital at approximately 35%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $103 million worth of shares at an average price per share of $421.53. For the entire fiscal year 2023, we repurchased over 900,000 shares for approximately $297 million at an average price per share of $320.35. At March 31, 2023, the company still had approximately $1.4 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect top line revenue of approximately $3.95 billion, representing growth of approximately 9% versus the prior year, with HOKA as our main growth engine, increasing in the range of 20% versus the prior year as we prioritize marketplace management expecting the majority of the growth in the brand's DTC channel and with wholesale growth assuming no net new doors added globally. UGG increasing low single digits, driven by international expansion and a relatively flat U.S. marketplace as we focus on driving the full price business by maintaining the brand's pull model. And DTC growth once again outpacing wholesale as we drive consumer acquisition and retention, margin improvement and prioritized marketplace management. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 52%, which is more than 150 basis points above last year as we are anticipating favorability from increasing DTC mix, increasing HOKA mix, with slight offsets from promotions, which we expect to be higher than last year as we anticipate a consumer environment that may have greater uncertainty. Currency and freight are expected to be slight net tailwinds to our gross margin for the full fiscal year, but we expect to see headwind and tailwind fluctuations between quarters when compared to last year. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we reinvest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business, which include talent across the organization, including areas we've delayed in the enterprise, supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, e-commerce capabilities and strategic marketing, which includes HOKA spend to grow awareness in leading international markets. Through the reinvestment of gross margin improvements into critical operating expense areas, we expect to maintain an approximate 18% operating margin in-line with what we've delivered in fiscal year 2023. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. This all results in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $21.10 to $21.60. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, which is above last year as we invest in capital IT projects, retail refreshment, including opening select new strategic locations and bolster our supply chain and warehouse capabilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. With a focus on delivering the full fiscal year, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance per normal course. However, given we are halfway through the first quarter, we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth slightly below the 9% full fiscal year guide as UGG is not expected to repeat the early U.S. wholesale shipments that the brand had experienced over the last couple of years during the first quarter and HOKA international wholesale growth anticipated to be slower due to not repeating the earlier distributor shipments that occurred in last year's first quarter. Gross margin is expected to be similar to the full fiscal year guided rate and SG&A dollar growth is planned to be up double digits as we anticipate significant deleverage in the first quarter due to the phasing of certain investments. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his closing remarks. Thanks, Laurent. DTC is going to be higher than that and wholesale will be lower than that. We didn't give specific numbers, Jon, but we did increase number of doors throughout FY \u201823. So we will be anniversary in some of that in FY \u201824. So we will be getting the full year benefit in the wholesale channel related to those stores. So \u2013 but we haven't given specific numbers. But yes, there was some door growth in \u201823 that will be anniversaried and is shown through wholesale growth in \u201824. Yes. So you're right, Jon. What we've said on Q1 is similar to the full year. Some of that improvement that you're talking about in the quarter, so Q1 is going to be driven by as we've talked about kind of a channel mix and a brand mix with HOKA being the contributor of growth there. So we're going to get really some benefit there. And then as opposed to last year, we will get some ocean freight benefit in the quarter as well. And then just in terms of further opportunity, I think there it will be kind of how things play out from an economic standpoint, what we have factored in are the improvements from a freight standpoint and the benefit of ocean freight. I think the levers that we will be closely monitoring throughout the year will be levels of promotion. So if promotions are not at a level that we expect, there could be some potential there. Yes, marketplace promotions, and then foreign currency, right? So we're assuming kind of foreign currency levels at current rates. So those will be the two that we're kind of watching in the marketplace. Yes. I'll give you and we won't give kind of numbers by brands, but I'll give you kind of direction. So significant improvement in the UGG inventory as we did close out some seasonal non-carryover styles within the UGG brand in Q4 that helped drive some revenue, a little bit of pressure on the margin as we closed that out, but really positioned us much better. HOKA, some growth and as you would expect, with the growing brand that we do have with HOKA. So overall, I think the composition of inventory, we are very pleased with. So, given our sales rate growth, supporting a high-growth brand in HOKA, I think our inventory levels look really good for where we stand. Yes. I will start. This is Steve. So Sam, I think the way we are looking at it is the growth that we saw with HOKA, clearly, the marketing we did drove demand. And so clearly, we benefited from that. Also, we were coming out of FY \u201822, where we had a large unmet demand with HOKA brand. So, that was driving a lot of the early in the year increases. I think what we saw throughout the year is continued productivity of our marketing spend. That's where we were able to tailor some of our marketing spend to still achieve that 18% operating margin. So, even in the face of the currency headwinds, looking at the productivity of our marketing, we were able to drive some leverage in that respect. That's not necessarily how we are looking at it in the same way for FY \u201824. We are looking to continue, as Dave mentioned earlier, to drive international global awareness around the HOKA brand. So, we are looking at increasing. We will see how productive that marketing spend is. Last year was also really the first year we benefited from a global campaign. So, probably experienced improved productivity over that. So, I just want to be careful on assumptions going into next year. But we will continue to invest in marketing. We continue to see high productivity of those dollars spend. We are increasing brand awareness, but we still, as Dave said, early innings and a long way to go here. Yes. So Chris, this is Steve. I will take that one. The \u2013 what we have said, right, we have not named kind of specific partners in the space in terms of number of doors. And so when we say on a global basis, as Dave was talking about before, we are looking across the globe in terms of there will be some accounts that have door expansions, there will have some accounts that may have door contraction. And as Dave mentioned, we are going to look at productivity of doors. So, that doesn't mean that we aren't going to open new doors. What it means is we may open some doors with some accounts, and we are going to close doors with other accounts. But we haven't talked specifically about which accounts or which partners, and we haven't given door accounts by those accounts."

I\u2019m pleased to be here today highlighting another record quarter for Deckers Brands, as our teams were once again have able to successfully execute against our long-term strategic objectives to deliver standout results in a dynamic consumer environment. Our fiscal third quarter record setting results include, $1.35 billion in consolidated revenue, reflecting a reported 13% increase versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share of $10.48. here as a progress during the third quarter included HOKA delivering record revenue of $352 million as a brand more than doubled its DTC business, while demonstrating momentum across the product line and significantly increased wholesale through both market share gains and select new strategic access points. UGG increasing its mix of business in DTC to 60%, up from 54% last year as the brand drove an 8% increase in the channel. Total portfolio DTC increasing 19% versus last year, to represent 52% of volume with both HOKA and UGG contributing to this mix shift, an all-time-high for the third quarter, and our international revenue increasing 12% on a reported basis, and growing 25% on a constant currency basis, when adjusting for the significant FX headwinds. Deckers delivered exceptional performance in the quarter and continued progress with respect to our long-term objectives. Notably, our brands commanded strong full-price selling despite a highly promotional marketplace during the holiday season. While our brands did experience more normalized promotions relative to extremely low levels in the past few years, we were able to avoid significant discounting due to the strength of consumer demand for our products, as well as disciplined marketplace management through our omnichannel approach. I\u2019m thankful for the leaders throughout our organization who continue to prioritize long-term brand health and remain committed to our strategic pillars, allowing Deckers to maintain top-tier profitability. Our brands are well positioned for calendar 2023 as we end our fiscal year 2024 in April. Steve will provide further details in our updated guidance for this fiscal year, as well as how we\u2019re thinking about the arduous macroeconomic environment. For now, let\u2019s get into the brand highlights for the third quarter, starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue in the third quarter was $930 million, down 2% versus last year on a reported basis, but up low single digits on a constant currency basis. Overall, consumer demand for UGG was strong in the quarter as the brand delivered global gains in DTC across genders and categories, driven by a 21% increase in acquired consumers and a 17% increase in retained consumers. The UGG brands\u2019 healthy DTC performance was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impacts across all channels, as well as lower wholesale revenue. This wholesale decline resulted from the unique shipment timing dynamics discussed at the outset of this fiscal year, which included an expectation that the third quarter would be impacted. Specifically, these earlier shipments drove temporarily elevated levels of inventory in the channel. As a result, and in line with our marketplace management strategies, the UGG brands\u2019 attention shifted to selling through product already in the channel, to strategically reduce marketplace inventory, allowing DTC to capture demand upside, and limiting the need for excess promotional activity. From a style and franchise perspective, UGG continues to find success with fresh updates of iconic styles. Throughout the year, consumers have continued to migrate to fashions that are uniquely UGG, such as the Classic Mini and Tasman, as well as more versatile derivatives of these products. The consumer demand for these products was quiet strong, and certain style color combinations even led to out of stocks. Our measured approach to buying aimed at driving improved inventory levels, combined with the high level of demand for these products, led to some scarcity in the marketplace. We see this approach as an effective tool to fuel demand and we\u2019ll continue to optimize our pull model to bounce future supply. With respect to how these styles are performed, we\u2019re encouraged to see the continued strength of adoption from the brands\u2019 target segment of 18 to 34 year olds. Among this segment in the US, the Classic Short remain the top seller, but the strongest growth came from the Classic Mini and Ultra Mini styles which ranked second and third, respectively. Platform Classics were also extremely popular with this age group, likely resulting from the brand heat generated through unpaid product gifting to A list celebrities which helped drive the hashtag, Platform UGGs as the brands\u2019 number one social trending topic in the quarter. Among 18 to 34 year old males in the US, UGG brand consideration reached an all-time-high in the third quarter, UGG has increasingly seen this segment of consumers adopt versatile slipper hybrids like the Tasman and Classic Slip-On as consumers continue broadening their wearing occasions of iconic styles. Beyond these hybrids, male consumers gravitated towards heritage winter boots such as [Fluff Yeah] [ph] as well as weatherized versions of iconic styles like the [inaudible]. Brand heat remains at an all-time-high based on the exciting new products designed for the brands target audience. Supplementing these fantastic inline products, our teams developed heat season, UGG continues to build fashion credibility through collaborations. The most recent of which was with designer Shayne Oliver, the founder of Hood by Air, Shayne\u2019s futuristic take on UGG Classics was covered by several high profile outlets, including Vogue, Complex and Hypebeast. These aspirational style continue to drive excitement in the line and bringing awareness to a new audience of consumers. From an international standpoint, UGG showed growth on a constant currency basis, despite revenue being down versus last year on a reported basis. This was led by DTC as acquired and retained consumers in the channel each grew 38% versus the prior year. International wholesale was down versus last year, as UGG lapped the supply chain disruption which pushed additional shipments into the prior years\u2019 third quarter. Strength in the UGG brands international regions is largely attributed to the successful ongoing marketplace reset activities completed over the last few years, which included a revamped approach to product and marketing, helping drive greater synergies in product adoption across the globe. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance UGG this fall. The brand continues to attract new consumers and drive more business through direct to consumer with a loyalty program that now has massed over 7 million members worldwide. We feel great about the brands\u2019 ability that offset more normalized promotional activity through a strategic shift in channel mix, which also helped reduce marketplace inventories heading into the spring 2023 season. We expect UGG to finish the fiscal year in a position of strength as demand for the brands\u2019 compelling products that are resonating with consumers globally has never been stronger. Shifting to HOKA. Global revenue for the third was $352 million, representing an increase of 91% versus last year on a reported basis. Another quarterly revenue record for HOKA. Just two quarters ago, we celebrated HOKA achieving $1 billion of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and with the quarter just delivered, the brand has now eclipsed $1 billion of revenue over the last nine months, ended December 2022. HOKA growth in the third quarter was driven by share gains with one specialty account in the wholesale channel as product flow improved this year relatively to last, allowing HOKA to increase sell through, added points of distribution with select strategic accounts as the brand has been slowly expanding throughout the year, global DTC revenue more than doubling versus last year, as consumer acquisition and retention increased 95% and 109%, respectively. And a favorable comparable period as wholesale shipments were disrupted in the prior year due primarily to port congestion. We believe the Fly Human Fly marketing campaign has been a key catalyst for the HOKA brands\u2019 DTC strength throughout the year which has driven a higher growth rate than wholesale on each quarter thus far this fiscal year. During the third quarter, targeted marketing activations in Chicago and New York City helped drive a 22% increase in brand awareness, a 27% in consideration and a 33% increase on purchase intent in these markets over the next six months. We also believe these markets have seen a halo effect from the additional brand visibility created by popup stores which have continued to perform well for HOKA. In particular, we saw a significant gains among 18 to 34 year old consumers, who in the US and EMEA drove the largest year-over-year increase of any age group during the third quarter. We have been increasingly encouraged by the broad product adoption from females in this coveted demographic, who appeared to be actively searching hoka.com for what is new and exciting on a regular basis. Giving us confidence and the investments we\u2019re making to build brand awareness globally. The all new [Solimar] [ph], our cross trainer is the perfect example of this trend. The Solimar launched earlier this fall without significant marketing dedicated to the shoe, but still landed in a top five of styles purchased by females aged 18 to 34 years old in this quarter. HOKA is also resonating well with males in this demographic, but we see a great deal of more opportunity to further expose the brands\u2019 product depths by testing access points to specialize and serving this target consumer. Importantly, even with the expansion beyond run specialty distribution, the brand has hyper-focused on delivering in that core channel as well. According to aggregated US run specialty store data, during December, HOKA increased market share by 5 percentage points versus last year, delivered the highest average product turns and maintain a gross margin well above the channel average. In terms of our wholesale partner access points in the third quarter, we are extremely proud of the HOKA brands\u2019 performance as that continued to build market share in a highly competitive marketplace. With the strength of consumer demand for the brand, HOKA was able to maintain its high percentage of full-price business even with the incremental access points with strategic accounts. Though early days in some of the brands\u2019 new doors, the feedback on HOKA performance has been exceptional. On the product side, HOKA has continued to introduce award-winning footwear, in October, HOKA was featured in the 2022 Men\u2019s Health Sneaker Awards with Bondi 8 being chosen for the most comfortable cushion, and the Kaha 2 GORE-TEX noted as the best hiking sneaker boot. In addition, Outside Magazine published its Winter Gear Guide for 2023, selecting the Mafate Speed 4 as the best shoe for fast in rugged trail runs. All of us at Deckers are excited for what is to come for the HOKA brand, starting with a couple of innovative product launches planned for the fourth quarter and more to come in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. In terms of consolidated channel performance in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in both global DTC and wholesale, but the majority of revenue growth was driven by global DTC which increased 19% versus last year on a reported basis, and 22% on a DTC comparable basis. DTC\u2019s strength was driven by impressive global consumer acquisition and retention across the entire portfolio, which increased 44% and 38%, respectively. From a dollar growth perspective, global HOKA DTC volume more than doubled and UGG DTC increased 8% on a reported basis versus the prior year, driving over $100 million of combined incremental revenue. On the wholesale side, consolidated global revenue increased 8% on a reported basis versus last year. Growth was driven by HOKA brand market share gains and existing points of distribution as well as incremental business from added doors with select strategic accounts. For the total portfolio, the increased HOKA volume was partially offset by lower wholesale shipments for UGG, where the brand focused on selling through existing inventory to reduce the need for promotional activity. Evidencing this success and illustrating the underlying brand heat during the season, UGG wholesale units sell through in the US increased mid-single-digits in fall \u201822 as compared to fall 2021. With the exceptional demand our brands were able to capture through DTC combined with a strategic actions taken on the UGG wholesale front, our third quarter DTC mix increased from 50% last year to 52% this year. In the third quarter, our brands achieved the highest DTC mix ever for our historically largest quarter, which represents great progress towards our long-term objective of a 50% mix of DTC business to the entire fiscal year across the portfolio. Alongside our disciplined omnichannel approach, I would like to share out our amazing design teams that continually bring compelling new products to market. The combination of these talented teams create the exceptional experience with our products that consumers have come to love and expect from our brands. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve to provide further details on the third quarter performance and an update on our fiscal year 2023 guidance.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Adding to Dave\u2019s remarks, I would like to express how encouraged we are with the performance of our brands as we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment. We are fortunate that our two largest brands are very healthy and proving resilience in a highly competitive marketplace, due primarily to their differentiated and compelling product offering. While HOKA continues to drive incredible growth as again shown in this quarter, UGG was able to deliver relatively flat reported revenue, as compared to last year\u2019s record revenue in a much more difficult consumer and macroeconomic environment that included a significant foreign exchange rate impact. In constant currency, the UGG brand delivered growth of low-single-digits in the quarter. Our organization\u2019s continued commitment to long-term strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to spending in an unchartered environment propelled Deckers to yet another record quarter. Now, let\u2019s get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance. Third quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $1.346 billion, representing an increase of 13% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 17.5% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of HOKA, which more than doubled its global DTC business through impressive increases in consumer acquisition and online retention, and increased wholesale revenue by 83% versus last year due to market share gains and select increased points of distribution with strategic partners. HOKA also benefited from an easier comparison to last year\u2019s third quarter when wholesale shipments were disrupted by inventory delays that resulted from port congestion. Gross margin for the third quarter was 53%, which is up 70 basis points from last year\u2019s 52.3%. The most material drivers of gross margin in the quarter were a significant benefit from reduced freight costs, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the prior year period. Additional gross margin impacts in the quarter included benefits from favorable channel mix with DTC growing faster than wholesale, favorable brand mix as the sales of our HOKA brand increased and price increases implemented at the end of last year. These were partially offset from more normalized promotions and closeout activity for UGG relative to minimal discounting last year. SG&A dollar spent in the third quarter was $350 million, up 7% versus last year\u2019s $328 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 160 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to benefits in the quarter from foreign currency remeasurement. But it still remains a headwind in the fiscal year-to-date through December, and a lower ratio of marketing to sales as we shifted the timing of HOKA campaign spent into the fourth quarter to align with the launch of spring 2023. Our tax rate was 23.7%, which is higher than last year\u2019s 20.5% primarily due to jurisdictional mix of business. These results combined with favorable interest income relative to last year, and a lower share count drove earnings per share to $10.48, which is more than $2 and 24% higher than last year\u2019s $8.42 per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31st, 2022, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.058 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $723 million, up 31% versus the same point in time last year, primarily to support the continued growth of the HOKA brand, which was light on inventory in the prior year due to factory delays, with some offset from UGG inventory being down year-over-year, and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million worth of shares at an average price of $350.25. As of December 31st, 2022, the company had approximately $1.46 billion of remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now, moving to our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2023. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be up 11% to 12% from our previous range of up 10% to 11%. This increase now equates to a full year revenue range of $3.50 billion to $3.53 billion. This is being driven by HOKA upside as the brand continues to exceed expectations in DTC and build market share across global wholesale access points. Reflecting this update, HOKA growth is now expected to increase in the low 50% range for the fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, implying more than $450 million of incremental revenue versus last year. The HOKA brands increased fiscal year revenue guide now implies a second half growth rate in the high 40% to low 50% range, with total dollar volume that is slightly greater than the first half, reflecting the brands\u2019 balanced revenue across the year. Due to last year\u2019s supply chain disruption that impacted quarterly wholesale revenue timing, the HOKA brands\u2019 growth rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the brands\u2019 typical run rate. With that said, we expect to see continued robust DTC demand from consumers driving strong growth in that channel. UGG revenue is still expected to be down mid-single-digits on a reported basis, implying a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter as the brand laps abnormal events in the prior year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, UGG had late arriving fall inventory, which wholesale customers would historically cancel, but instead they kept their orders preferring to procure inventory on the earlier side for the future seasons. This resulted in additional growth in the prior year fourth quarter that is not expected to be repeated. Additionally, UGG DTC benefited from backorder product that shipped in January last year. Further, of all our brands, UGG is the most globally exposed brand, and as a result, continues to face the most significant headwinds from an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to last year. Beyond our increased revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2023, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 50.5%, SG&A as a percentage of sales is still expected to be approximately 33%; operating margin is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Our effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%. And our increased diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $18 to $18.50. As a reminder, due to the disruptive nature of how the second half of last year played out, the company pushed hard to improve the availability of our products earlier this year, and that strategy has served us well, and due to this push, more products shipped earlier this year, and that, combined with currency headwinds have placed pressure on the reported percentage growth in the fourth quarter. With that said, we believe viewing our increased expectation for the full fiscal year more holistically is a better measure of the progress our brands are making. In this context, we are delivering on what we said and have continued to increase our full fiscal year outlook, despite a harsher impact from foreign currency fluctuations, as compared to initial expectations at the outset of this year. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressure, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the US dollar and geopolitical tensions. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, I wanted to provide further context around the state of our business. On Logistics, the level of disruption, delays and corresponding freight costs relative to the same point in time last year has continued to improve, though they remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. While the ongoing outbreak in China is not currently impacting footwear production or transit times in a material way. We are experiencing some minimal operational hurdles, and we\u2019ll continue to watch this situation closely. In terms of inventory, we\u2019ve continued to see improvement in the ratio of inventory growth to sales growth over the last few quarters, as was signaled in our expectations throughout this year. While still working to optimize levels, we feel good about our current inventory position, which is up over last year to satisfy increased HOKA demand. We still anticipate unique year-over-year comparisons based on disruption in the supply chain, as well as the dynamics of the HOKA brands\u2019 increasing mix of both revenue and inventory, especially as it\u2019s more even quarterly revenue cadence compared to UGG. Regarding promotional activity, as we have discussed over the last few quarters, the marketplace has become increasingly influenced by higher levels of markdown activity. While our brands have maintained a high percentage of full price business, there has been a return to more normalized levels of promotion experienced prior to the pandemic, particularly with the UGG brand. HOKA has largely avoided additional discounting beyond the historical model update flow. Given the dynamics of the marketplace, which is dealing with higher channel inventory, we are well positioned having managed inventory into the wholesale channel, while leveraging our DTC capabilities, selling earlier and at higher margins, gaining share and exceeding our original expectations on the year. On currency, we\u2019ve continued to experience impacts on our results from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting an approximate impact of $20 million to revenue, and our expected headwind for the full fiscal year 2023 remains at approximately $100 million. Finally, as we finish out our fiscal year 2023 and look to deliver another exceptional year, we are also reflecting on the actions we took to manage our expense base and the tradeoffs made to deliver these results. While we are not yet providing guidance for fiscal year 2024, and as our business expands, we will continue to review and invest in those areas that will drive the organization forward, especially as we start to see gross margin expansion. In this highly competitive environment, those further investments will support talent, innovation, technology, and enterprise infrastructure, which are all critical to our continued success. Thanks, everyone. And now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. We are proud of our strong results and ability to navigate a challenged consumer landscape through our marketplace managing strategies tailored to each of our unique brands. Exiting the holiday season, we are encouraged by and have great confidence in the strength of our brands and the exciting future ahead. With the brand heat we\u2019re seeing on HOKA and UGG in particular, we feel Deckers is well positioned. Both brands operate on a pull model, and we believe the strong relationships our brands have built with key wholesale partners will serve us well. Deckers\u2019 strategic brand marketplace management, omnichannel capabilities and flexible operating model continue to be the driving forces behind our company\u2019s sustained success. But Deckers\u2019 success is ultimately made possible by the hardworking employees who go above and beyond to deliver consistent results aligned with our long-term strategic goals. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more as we continue to build towards Deckers\u2019 exciting future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nAubrey Tianello: Hey, everyone. This is Aubrey Tianello on for Laurent. Can you guys hear me okay?\nDave Powers: Yep \u2013\nSteve Fasching: We can hear you.\nDave Powers: Welcome.\nAubrey Tianello: All right, thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to start on the wholesale side, up 8% in the quarter, I think last quarter you talked about the channel being down slightly in 2H. Maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in that channel, how it\u2019s progressed versus 90 days ago?\nDave Powers: Yeah, you\u2019re talking about second half or Q3, Q4? What specifically are you talking about the quarter?\nAubrey Tianello: The wholesale up 8% in the quarter. But I think you spoke to wholesale being down slightly in 2H on the last call. Just any you know color you can give on whether that\u2019s still the view or if something\u2019s changed?\nDave Powers: Yeah, I let Steve get into specifics. But I think you know, a lot of this and he will explain this in more detail as the call goes on. But it\u2019s just the timing of deliveries versus last year. So that\u2019s the big part of the dynamic and then shifts between Q3 and Q4. But Steve I don\u2019t know if you have more color on that.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. I think you know, when we get into the quarterly discussion, it\u2019s a little bit about what we alluded to at the beginning of the year. We knew that given \u2013 coming out again, Q4, just to remind everyone, where we shipped product last year in Q4, that was going to impact Q3 and Q4 of this year in terms of wholesale growth. So we took the opportunity to sell products in. We had wholesale customers participating and wanting to hold some of that product that they didn\u2019t sell in Q4, which we knew would impact Q3 and Q4 of this year. So I think, as we see Q3 and Q4 play out, it\u2019s much to our expectation and a little bit better, which is why we are increasing our full year outlook. We knew kind of between quarters, there would be some disruption in the current year, again, why we didn\u2019t guide quarterly. But I think continuing to see strong demand with our wholesalers. This is a bit of you know impact from pandemic and supply chain disruption experienced last year, still playing through this year. It is impacting how we see wholesale growth in the current year, but we knew that, right and it goes a little bit back to the point I made in the prepared remarks, which was, we were going to take every opportunity to get products in early in the year to make sure that we have an opportunity for strong sell through during the season, which is exactly what we\u2019ve seen. And our brands continue to perform well and resonate with customers. So both on the UGG side, and especially as you can see in the numbers on the HOKA side. So, again, really pleased with our performance, again, don\u2019t want to get hung up on quarterly percentage changes, because really, we\u2019re measuring the health of the business on the year and that\u2019s our outlook on the race for the year.\nDave Powers: Yeah, and I think just as a reminder, you know, Q3 last year, we were in some cases starved for inventory. And we, you know, brought inventory that we could have sold in Q3 brought in in Q4 for both UGG and HOKA, and the wholesalers were happy to take it at that time, and particularly for UGG, they were happy to fill up on kind of core styles, knowing that they would carry it into Q3 this year, and that dynamic has played out. But now we\u2019re comping, you know, those increased shipments in Q4 last year. But overall, as Steve said, the brands are very healthy, full price sales throughout our wholesale partners is strong and the demand from them is still there. But keep in mind, they\u2019re also working through you know, inventory situation, a lot of promotional activity in the marketplace, and then working through their own inventory. So they\u2019re careful about who they bring in for brands. And fortunately, our brands are very, very strong. So they\u2019re prioritizing us, but they still have a lot of inventory from other brands to work through in this environment.\nAubrey Tianello: Hey, got it. Very clear. And then on HOKA, if I can just ask a follow-up. You mentioned expanding through strategic access points on wholesale. Can you maybe just give a little more detail on that? Would the opportunity looks like there to expand? HOKA in the wholesale channel outside of specialty running? And kind of what the strategy is there? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I\u2019m happy to talk about that. And this is, you know, I would say on a global scale, we are very selective of who we sell HOKA to in wholesale. We\u2019re always prioritizing the run specialty channel, that\u2019s our bread and butter and the authenticity of the brand. But you know, we\u2019re strong in places like REI, we\u2019ve expanded doors index in the third quarter. And as we mentioned in the call that\u2019s growing very well. We\u2019re in a handful of footlocker doors, but right now we\u2019re not really looking to expand too many more doors in wholesale, we\u2019re focused on healthy sell through and expanding categories. And then, you know, as we saw in Q3, DTC is exceptionally strong. And we want to continue to you know, drive the growth strategically in wholesale, create awareness, get in front of the right consumers, but ultimately drive as much business as we can through DTC, because for all the right reasons, margin, consumer data, lifetime value. So it\u2019s a healthy balance and this is a good reflection of our strategy towards ultimately being a 50% DTC company, you can see how this is working in this quarter.\nAubrey Tianello: Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. I want to ask first just about the UGG brand. It looks like you\u2019ve had some incredible heat for a few of the styles that were hard to get from the consumer side. So I\u2019m curious just how you view availability and your plans for things like the platforms in the Ultra? And then what type of response are you seeing from wholesalers who maybe didn\u2019t have much of that product, but presumably would want some at some point looking forward?\nDave Powers: Yeah, I can share with you my inbox of emails of people looking for those styles. So you know, I think to take it up to a higher level as we\u2019re managing through our inventory in the UGG brand you know, we pulled back a little bit on how much we invested in some of these new styles, not anticipating how strong the consumer demand for them would be. So you know, the platform styles, the Tas, the Ultra Mini, those styles, you know, in many cases sold out to the piece. And so, we missed some opportunity there. The good news is that wholesalers want more, the consumer wants more. And we\u2019ve realized that these extended Classics, you know, in more iterations of core classics would keep our brand DNA intact, are resonating very, very well with particularly younger consumers. But I would say all consumers, and then on a global scale. So you know, you can feel confident that we\u2019re going to continue on that path and developing these styles, take advantage of the platform trends, et cetera as we continue through the year and beyond. So, good news is that you know core classics remain strong and healthy. But some of these new iterations were better than we expected. Which is great news. And you know, there\u2019s demand on the table and the consumer is hungry for.\nJonathan Komp: That\u2019s great. Then maybe a follow-up, a set of questions on the HOKA. A little bit of a similar question, could you just maybe elaborate on the strength of the 18 to 34 year old demographic, you know, what\u2019s changed there and maybe accelerated adoption? And then just Steve, when I look at the HOKA revenue, typically, the fourth quarter is a little higher than the third quarter in dollars. So I understand that year ago comparison looks different, but any reason why the fourth quarter dollars would be down from the third quarter? Thanks again.\nDave Powers: Yep. Thanks, Jon. So yeah, on the HOKA side, you know, we\u2019re very happy with these results. I think, in the early days of HOKA, you know, we were selling obviously to core runners and beyond, and then some people were using it for, you know, comfort and longevity reasons. And the younger consumers weren\u2019t really adopting it as part of their own yet, but we\u2019ve seen that shift \u2013 change dramatically in the last year or so, you know, in the 18 to 34 year old category was our fastest growing consumer segment. So it\u2019s working as, you know, as we planned, probably a little better than we planned, tapping a little faster than we planned. But some of the activities we\u2019re doing, the collabs with folks like free people, et cetera, marketing, but you\u2019re seeing, you know, teenage girls and boys trading from traditional athletic brands into HOKA, and raving about it. So it\u2019s very exciting. And it just expands the breadth of our brand from ages, you know, 18 to 80. And I think that marketing and the product teams are doing an exceptional job of creating right product for that consumer, putting it in the right place, and showcasing it the right way. And some of the extended work we\u2019re doing on the lifestyle side, taking core styles, but you know, different treatments, different materials, different colors that are more kind of lifestyle focused, that\u2019s working extremely well, too. So we think that this is a big unlock for the brand long-term. We want to be healthy and meaningful and important to this younger consumer. And we\u2019re seeing that play out, which is really great.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, and Jon, this is Steve. On the Q3, Q4 HOKA dynamic. Again, it goes back to a little bit, you know, we\u2019re dealing with disruptive supply chain last year, right. So there\u2019s a dynamic on the year-over-year comparison in Q3 and Q4. Then to your point on kind of Q4 versus Q3 this year. As we\u2019ve had more inventory availability, we\u2019ve been putting that into the marketplace. At the same time you know, we know as Dave said, there is more product in the marketplace. So we want to control the marketplace. You know, we\u2019ll look and see how the brand continues to grow, it\u2019s going to continue to grow a little bit disproportionate in percentage terms, again, because of how we\u2019re making those comparisons to last year. But this is a little bit to our marketplace management. We also have new models that are being introduced in Q4. So there\u2019s some change in some of the wholesale deliveries in the quarter. But again, this is a brand that\u2019s continuing to grow overall solid growth plan for the year, a little bit choppy between quarters, you know, and strong demand that we continue to see, that wholesalers are demanding product. So, managing the DTC business, managing the wholesale business, managing the marketplace, recognizing what\u2019s going on there. I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned over the Q3, Q4 dynamic. You know, we\u2019ve just got choppy quarters going on in this year.\nDave Powers: Yeah, and I think you know, from a consumer perspective, you know, they don\u2019t know the quarterly ins and outs, but they\u2019re seeing the product it\u2019s selling through very well at full price and the demand is certainly there. You know, and I think you have to pull back and look at the full year results of this brand, and especially the way both of our brands and Q3 performed in a very challenging environment, FX pressures, promotional environment, and to come out with this rate of high level \u2013 high price, full price sell through, healthy margins, and still momentum and demand in the marketplace. You know, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And so, we see this continuing and the brands as I said before, I\u2019ve never been in a better place the brand heat that we see. And UGG and HOKA are exceptional and we\u2019re going to continue to build on that. And, you know, invest in these brands for the long-term.\nSteve Fasching: And then I think just the last thing and we\u2019ll move on, but, you know, I think the demand that we\u2019re seeing for HOKA is highlighted in again, our raise for our full year outlook. So that raise is being driven by the increased demand that we\u2019re seeing from HOKA. You know, again, just speaking to the strength we continue to see with HOKA and how it\u2019s resonating in the marketplace.\nDave Powers: And particularly, international.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, yeah.\nJonathan Komp: That\u2019s great. Thanks again.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: The next question will be from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. I\u2019m just curious maybe on HOKA, if you can talk about a little bit more detail in terms of how much of the growth is being driven by existing accounts versus your new distribution partners? Any more color you can give around that? And then second, just curious how much has pricing been a driver in the sales change at each brand? And maybe whether that looks different within DTC versus wholesale? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yeah, good questions. I would say for HOKA, the majority of the growth is coming from existing accounts, you know, outside of, you know, some expansion in Q3 in Dick\u2019s stores, there really wasn\u2019t a lot of expansion in new doors globally. So, you know, we\u2019re continuing to gain market share, you saw that in their pre-recorded comments. And that\u2019s happening, you know, across the board. It\u2019s not just a run specialty. So, strong full price sell through, healthy margins for the retailers, great presentations in wholesale. But we\u2019re getting better at it as we go and the wholesale accounts are realizing the power of this brand. And so the majority of that is coming from existing accounts at this point, which again, goes back to the brand marketplace management and just, you know, speaking to the right consumer. What was the other question, sorry?\nSteve Fasching: The pricing?\nDave Powers: The pricing. Yes, sorry. You know, we have raised prices in both brands this past Q3 and coming into the fall period, and we didn\u2019t see any, really any resistance to that, you know, obviously evidenced by the sellout of some of these UGG styles and some of the price increases in HOKA, we haven\u2019t really seen a slowdown in sell through. And so I think the product is worth it. The brand is, you know, meaningful and important to these consumers. And they were willing to pay full price even though some of the prices were higher.\nPaul Lejuez: What was the magnitude of the increase year-over-year? If you can share that.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I think it was like overall is about 8% across both brands.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Powers: On lifestyles.\nSteve Fasching: On the lifestyle. So like again, we didn\u2019t do \u2013 we didn\u2019t raise price on every \u2013\nDave Powers: Correct, sorry, yeah.\nSteve Fasching: We raised price on certain select styles but today\u2019s point that was called around 8% of the styles. And it wasn\u2019t all at the beginning of the year. It was some styles on HOKA at the beginning of the year, and then it was some products in UGG on the fall season.\nPaul Lejuez: And is that an even higher number when you adjusted for mix you were introducing higher price styles into the assortment generally?\nSteve Fasching: The pricing is up a little bit, but not I wouldn\u2019t say significantly different.\nDave Powers: No. In UGG when we\u2019re also doing, you know more slippers and Tasmans that a little bit lower priced than the Classic and some of the Minis you know, it may affect the total average price across the board. But you know, I think we\u2019re providing excellent value and quality for the price and I think the consumer sees that and it\u2019s resonating strongly with them and willing to pay it.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you. Good luck.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Tom Nikic from Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask about UGG. So obviously the last couple of years have been you know fairly wonky you know between COVID stuff and supply chain and the dynamics around wholesale. But I mean when we \u2013 when you kind of think about UGG on a more you know normal basis or a long-term basis like how should we think about the growth of that brand? I mean, what \u2013 is it \u2013 you know, this thing a mid-single-digit grower or is it a high-single-digit grower under normal times, like just, I think you know given how wonky things have been the last year, I think it\u2019s hard to sort of wrap your head around what the sort of normal algorithm is for this brand?\nDave Powers: Yeah, I mean certainly we\u2019re still dealing with normalization of the business, you know, from COVID and some of that is related to refilling the marketplace of inventory coming off the peak, balancing that out. And so you know, right now, where we sit right now, we\u2019re probably looking at low-single-digits, just to be prudent and as we reset the marketplace. You know, I am very excited about the product pipeline and the new leadership under Anne and the way the design teams and the marketing teams are collaborating globally for this brand, you know, we\u2019re getting better at this every day. And so I think the opportunity is there, but we\u2019re still trying to navigate and make sure we set the marketplace correctly. Right now, it\u2019s extremely well managed globally. The inventories are clean and healthy. We have some inventory a little bit to work through here and there. But the long-term outlook for this brand, I think is exciting. But I would say where we sit now in the shorter-term, it\u2019s you know we\u2019re looking at low-single-digits, knowing that the environment and the global macroeconomic situation is still a little bit challenged. Different than HOKA, because that\u2019s, you know, more of a hyper growth. And so a lot of people haven\u2019t heard of the brand yet across the globe or UGG is obviously a household name. And it\u2019s about fine-tuning the product assortment being meaningful to each of the consumer segments, and managing the marketplace globally, while driving a healthy DTC business to improve margins.\nTom Nikic: Understood. And if I could just follow-up on margins real quick. So you know I think you did talk a bit about normalizing promos, but or normalizing discounts or whatever. But on the gross margins, it would seem like there would be you know some kind of good guys over the next 12 months as well, you know, kind of freight rolling off and FX, I guess, turns from a bad guy to a good guy and channel mix and brand mix, et cetera. So, definitely seems like there\u2019s a fairly bright gross margin outlook like, you know, how should we think about the drop through to EBIT margins? And I know you want to invest in the growth of the brands, but you know can we see EBIT margins creep higher over time?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, Tom this is Steve, I\u2019ll take that one. And you know, we\u2019re not giving guidance yet. And it going a little bit to what I said in the prepared remarks. And so, we are experiencing improvements in gross margin, you\u2019ve seen it in Q3 as you model it in, you\u2019ll see it in Q4, where that\u2019s largely coming from the freight. So you are right, we\u2019re seeing freight rates come down. In the current quarter, Q4, we\u2019re going to benefit from that, we\u2019re seeing that increase. Overall, there still is, you know, an FX headwind. So for the year, as you can see in our guidance, we are lower on a gross margin basis, we\u2019ll continue to see some improvement with ocean freight, but it\u2019s going to be at lower levels than what you\u2019re seeing come through in the current quarter. So there will be to your point a little bit of a tailwind, we\u2019ll see what happens with currency, right. Currencies turned more beneficial to us. It\u2019s in kind of mid-to-late Q3. We\u2019re seeing some of that, but it\u2019s still down from a year ago. So to your point, we\u2019ll see what happens. There is a potential there, you know, for some improvements that could contribute to the gross margin. But as I also said, you know, we\u2019ve tightened our belt this year to deliver on what we guided, we\u2019ve held off on some investments within the business to continue to deliver within that range of guidance, and so we\u2019re evaluating it. And while we haven\u2019t given guidance on next year, we do expect there will be some gross margin expansion. And we\u2019re going to use that to invest in the business, especially in the competitive nature of where this business is and what we\u2019re doing with our brands. And so that investment is critical to keeping us relevant and leading in this space. So that is clearly something we are going to do with some of that gross margin expansion. Now, as I\u2019ve said before, right, when there\u2019s an opportunity, we see strong businesses their opportunity to reflect some of that upside. Yeah, and we did do that a couple of years ago. But first, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re looking at some of this gross margin expansion, investing it in the business because it\u2019s proving well, we\u2019re delivering exceptional results. We\u2019re well above many of our peers in terms of operating profit. So we got to keep continuing to invest in this business. So, yeah, there is, but you know, there\u2019s also investments that we have to make them in business.\nTom Nikic: Yeah, yeah. Understood. Thanks guys and best of luck this year.\nSteve Fasching: Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from John Kernan from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrista Zuber: Hi, this is Krista Zuber on for John. Just wanted to circle back on the inventory question in terms of kind of where you see or how \u2013 what your level of comfort is on the inventory levels by channel, DTC and wholesale? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, I think the \u2013 so speaking to our inventory, we, you know, this is something we indicated at the beginning of the year, that it was something that we would be working through this year. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that, inventory levels have improved. As we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, again, inventory level on UGG actually decreased, again, signaling some of the work that we\u2019ve been doing and the improvement efforts that we\u2019ve been making. You know, what we\u2019re also doing is increasing our HOKA inventory. So when you got a quarter that\u2019s growing 90%, you got to have inventory to service those sales. So we have been increasing inventory. You know, I think in terms of as we look out further, there\u2019s still opportunity to optimize inventory levels. But when we look at the relationship of inventory to sales growth it\u2019s coming much more in line, we feel comfortable about our inventory, there\u2019s always room for a little bit of improvement, we\u2019ll continue to work on that improvement, as things begin to normalize, especially with the supply chain. But where we sit today with everything that\u2019s going on with the growth of our brands, we feel comfortable about our inventory positions, and we\u2019ll continue to work to optimize those levels.\nDave Powers: Yeah, and I would say from a channel perspective, you know, I think the channel is in good place with the inventory. You know, we were able to fill the bucket, so to speak in UGG last year, and we\u2019re getting back inventory in key styles in HOKA. So I think it\u2019s in a very healthy place and that\u2019s reflected in, you know, how DTC exceeded wholesale growth in the quarter. Still healthy sell throughs globally. So again, credit to the teams you know managing the marketplace in this environment. But I would say, you know, from a brand health and a marketplace and a market channel perspective, things are in good shape. And, you know, in addition to what Steve said about how we\u2019re managing and our number on levels.\nKrista Zuber: Thank you.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: And the next question is from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Erinn, I know and thank you guys for giving part of what I always ask, but Erinn, can you give us the whole thing, please for wholesale or DTC?\nErinn Kohler: Hi, Sam, sure thing. So for the quarter global wholesale, including distributor by brand is what I\u2019ll give you. So for UGG, that will be $374 million, for HOKA, $224 million, for Teva, $25 million, for Sanuk, $3 million. And then that gives you other which is predominantly Koolaburra, $20 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you. And Steve, I want to commend you, I think you should run for President given your answer to John Komp\u2019s question. So I\u2019m going to ask it again. Could you give \u2013 if you look at the DTC business, and if you look at wholesale business historically, Q4 for HOKA has accelerated from Q3. So the question is, do you anticipate that Q4 HOKA revenue will be higher than Q3?\nSteve Fasching: And I think John answered that question, right. So when you take the numbers in, given what we sold in as well as what we sold through our DTC, we\u2019re not expecting that on \u2013 growth on Q3. Again, we\u2019ve got dynamics that are underlying between quarters, right. And that\u2019s why I want to be careful that people aren\u2019t so focused on Q3, Q4, as I said, we\u2019re managing this business for the year. It\u2019s why we have not this year, given quarterly guidance. We know we\u2019ve got dynamics within quarters this year, where we\u2019re trying to get more products in early. And that, as I said before, has worked well for us, right. So we want to make sure we have you know the right perspective of how the business is trending. Now, when you then look at mix, right. That\u2019s going to play an impact on revenue reported. So when we\u2019re looking at volumes, right volumes are a little bit different due to the channels that we\u2019re selling in. Our guide equates to similar volume levels. But again, I want to be careful that people aren\u2019t so focused on a Q3, Q4 dynamics. It\u2019s the full year right and you know, we\u2019re coming out of a quarter where we grew the brand 90%, there is demand out there. So, again, we\u2019re going to get product in, we\u2019re going to get it in there, we want to make sure it has an opportunity to sell through, and then we\u2019ll see what happens. And then again, we have tremendous confidence in HOKA. And \u2013 but at the same time, we\u2019re managing the marketplace. We know that there are a lot of competitors that have a lot of inventory within the wholesale channel, we don\u2019t need to contribute to that confusion, we\u2019ve got a brand that\u2019s red hot that continues to perform well, this goes to our marketplace management. So brand is in great shape. I don\u2019t want people to get worked up about a Q3, Q4 dynamic. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about.\nSam Poser: But I understand. And I\u2019m not trying to get worked up as we\u2019re trying to model this properly. The question, though, is, as you talked about, I think Dave, you spoke of one more after this, which is related to UGG, but with HOKA, you spoke about some new, you know, shoe you sounded pretty excited about that are launching in Q4. And now is this situation because of the scenario that Steve just mentioned that you would launch it in direct to consumer first, maybe in Q4 and then launch it to wholesale in Q1? I mean, so is that what you\u2019re thinking about? I mean, as far as manage \u2013 you know, how you bring things to market? Where, you know, I mean, I\u2019m just trying to understand it, because you\u2019re bringing in brand new products and the demand real high than those retailers want your product then it really will probably take away from some other brand not necessarily from you and theoretically not make things worse.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I think you know, what you\u2019re looking at a little bit is some of those launches in Q4 had to ship in Q3 to be in the marketplace that, you know, in time and no. And then also, I talked about the Solimar. And also the new transit that just launched today, those are small buys and small volume drivers in a first introduction, so heavily weighted on DTC, you know, wholesalers, you know, want to see performance in your own channels before they invest heavily. So, yes, they\u2019re exciting. Yes, they\u2019re new. Yes, they\u2019ll steal some market share from competitors. But the scale of those on the business at this point are still small. And then some of that inventory has also shipped in Q3, which is why you see the 90% increase.\nSam Poser: Got you. And then on UGG given the guidance, I would assume you know that you\u2019re going to have a big swing on wholesale in the fourth quarter, which is really about the big increase that happened in Q1 \u2013 sorry in Q4 last year. But can you just and since it is not you know on a relative basis, it\u2019s your second smallest quarter. Can you give us some direction on how to think about the wholesale for \u2013 in the fourth quarter? I mean, does it have a negative \u2013 is it a negative 20 handle negative 30 handle negative? You know, give us something there that can, because it sounds like the wholesale is going to be down much more than the DTC though the DTC is probably going to be down a bit.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I mean, I think DTC, you know, there was exceptional results in DTC in Q3, you know, as we said, some of those you know really hot styles have sold out and we are selling fumes, the golden stars with a new introduction in Q4 that is already selling out. So there\u2019s hot demand for some of these styles. But as we\u2019ve been managing our inventory levels, we didn\u2019t buy as heavily into some of these new styles yet, not anticipating that kind of sell through. On the wholesale side, you know, yeah, they still have inventory leftover from what they purchased throughout the year. More than kind of the core classics, they\u2019re still struggling with the hot new styles, you know just like we are in DTC, what you\u2019re going to see it down, you know, in the 20%, 30% range for the quarter. But again, if you look at the market sell through and the health of the brand in the marketplace, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and you know it\u2019s tough. I understand you\u2019re trying to model quarters, but it\u2019s a funky dynamic wonky as one person already said, and but I think we got to go back to like, what is the health of this brand and how are things selling through?\nSteve Fasching: Well, again, I mean, the UGG costs of being down in Q4, you have so much that shifted from Q3 to Q4 last year, and you brought more of it in Q3 this year. And so that\u2019s not really \u2013 that\u2019s a different scenario than health. That\u2019s not expected. It\u2019s just more a matter of trying to triangulate where it is.\nDave Powers: Yeah \u2013\nSteve Fasching: Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yeah, absolutely.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Chris Nardone with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nChris Nardone: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in China for both your UGG and HOKA businesses? And if you can elaborate maybe on your specific expansion strategy for HOKA, and then if there\u2019s any way to quantify, you know, the potential build back, you can see in the UGG business, given the lockdowns over the last, you know, two to three years? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yeah, sure. You know, it\u2019s hard to comment on things right now in this quarter. But you know, I think coming out of the year-to-date so far in China, listen, I give our teams over there, the leadership and management team, the way they have managed the last three years in that marketplace with all the challenges from COVID and lockdowns, and you know, consumers not being able to spend, I think we\u2019re in you know, exceptional shape and our brands as considering the marketplace. So the brands, you know, are strong, they\u2019re healthy, they\u2019re in demand, the marketing tactics that we\u2019re employing for both brands over there being more locally relevant, the collabs that we\u2019re doing in UGG, the fashion partnerships, reaching in younger consumer, those are all checking boxes and performing extremely well. You know, I think what you\u2019ll start to see, and I was talking to the China team the other night, you\u2019re going to start to see consumers come back out. And we feel really good about our chances, you know, for the finish of this year and heading into next year. Keep in mind that, you know, China isn\u2019t a massive business for us yet, we do have long-term aspirations. But I think we\u2019re going to see that consumer come back not only domestically but globally. And that\u2019ll be an interesting dynamic for us and other brands. But we like the way we\u2019re set up the like, we like the way we\u2019re managing the marketplace, the way we\u2019re resourcing it, and then specifically to HOKA you know, so far so good. We\u2019ve invested in our own stores, we\u2019re working with partners on door expansion, creating awareness in the marketplace in an authentic way. And we\u2019re going to continue on that path because we see just tremendous opportunity for HOKA in the long-term. And so far, we\u2019re seeing good signs from our partners and our retail stores and gives us a lot of confidence that this can be a big success over time.\nChris Nardone: Thanks.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nSteve Fasching: You bet.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And that concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you so much for joining Deckers Brands third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. And you may now disconnect. Take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to be here today highlighting another record quarter for Deckers Brands, as our teams were once again have able to successfully execute against our long-term strategic objectives to deliver standout results in a dynamic consumer environment. Our fiscal third quarter record setting results include, $1.35 billion in consolidated revenue, reflecting a reported 13% increase versus the prior year, and diluted earnings per share of $10.48. here as a progress during the third quarter included HOKA delivering record revenue of $352 million as a brand more than doubled its DTC business, while demonstrating momentum across the product line and significantly increased wholesale through both market share gains and select new strategic access points. UGG increasing its mix of business in DTC to 60%, up from 54% last year as the brand drove an 8% increase in the channel. Total portfolio DTC increasing 19% versus last year, to represent 52% of volume with both HOKA and UGG contributing to this mix shift, an all-time-high for the third quarter, and our international revenue increasing 12% on a reported basis, and growing 25% on a constant currency basis, when adjusting for the significant FX headwinds. Deckers delivered exceptional performance in the quarter and continued progress with respect to our long-term objectives. Notably, our brands commanded strong full-price selling despite a highly promotional marketplace during the holiday season. While our brands did experience more normalized promotions relative to extremely low levels in the past few years, we were able to avoid significant discounting due to the strength of consumer demand for our products, as well as disciplined marketplace management through our omnichannel approach. I'm thankful for the leaders throughout our organization who continue to prioritize long-term brand health and remain committed to our strategic pillars, allowing Deckers to maintain top-tier profitability. Our brands are well positioned for calendar 2023 as we end our fiscal year 2024 in April. Steve will provide further details in our updated guidance for this fiscal year, as well as how we're thinking about the arduous macroeconomic environment. For now, let's get into the brand highlights for the third quarter, starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue in the third quarter was $930 million, down 2% versus last year on a reported basis, but up low single digits on a constant currency basis. Overall, consumer demand for UGG was strong in the quarter as the brand delivered global gains in DTC across genders and categories, driven by a 21% increase in acquired consumers and a 17% increase in retained consumers. The UGG brands' healthy DTC performance was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impacts across all channels, as well as lower wholesale revenue. This wholesale decline resulted from the unique shipment timing dynamics discussed at the outset of this fiscal year, which included an expectation that the third quarter would be impacted. Specifically, these earlier shipments drove temporarily elevated levels of inventory in the channel. As a result, and in line with our marketplace management strategies, the UGG brands' attention shifted to selling through product already in the channel, to strategically reduce marketplace inventory, allowing DTC to capture demand upside, and limiting the need for excess promotional activity. From a style and franchise perspective, UGG continues to find success with fresh updates of iconic styles. Throughout the year, consumers have continued to migrate to fashions that are uniquely UGG, such as the Classic Mini and Tasman, as well as more versatile derivatives of these products. The consumer demand for these products was quiet strong, and certain style color combinations even led to out of stocks. Our measured approach to buying aimed at driving improved inventory levels, combined with the high level of demand for these products, led to some scarcity in the marketplace. We see this approach as an effective tool to fuel demand and we'll continue to optimize our pull model to bounce future supply. With respect to how these styles are performed, we're encouraged to see the continued strength of adoption from the brands' target segment of 18 to 34 year olds. Among this segment in the US, the Classic Short remain the top seller, but the strongest growth came from the Classic Mini and Ultra Mini styles which ranked second and third, respectively. Platform Classics were also extremely popular with this age group, likely resulting from the brand heat generated through unpaid product gifting to A list celebrities which helped drive the hashtag, Platform UGGs as the brands' number one social trending topic in the quarter. Among 18 to 34 year old males in the US, UGG brand consideration reached an all-time-high in the third quarter, UGG has increasingly seen this segment of consumers adopt versatile slipper hybrids like the Tasman and Classic Slip-On as consumers continue broadening their wearing occasions of iconic styles. Beyond these hybrids, male consumers gravitated towards heritage winter boots such as [Fluff Yeah] [ph] as well as weatherized versions of iconic styles like the [inaudible]. Brand heat remains at an all-time-high based on the exciting new products designed for the brands target audience. Supplementing these fantastic inline products, our teams developed heat season, UGG continues to build fashion credibility through collaborations. The most recent of which was with designer Shayne Oliver, the founder of Hood by Air, Shayne's futuristic take on UGG Classics was covered by several high profile outlets, including Vogue, Complex and Hypebeast. These aspirational style continue to drive excitement in the line and bringing awareness to a new audience of consumers. From an international standpoint, UGG showed growth on a constant currency basis, despite revenue being down versus last year on a reported basis. This was led by DTC as acquired and retained consumers in the channel each grew 38% versus the prior year. International wholesale was down versus last year, as UGG lapped the supply chain disruption which pushed additional shipments into the prior years' third quarter. Strength in the UGG brands international regions is largely attributed to the successful ongoing marketplace reset activities completed over the last few years, which included a revamped approach to product and marketing, helping drive greater synergies in product adoption across the globe. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance UGG this fall. The brand continues to attract new consumers and drive more business through direct to consumer with a loyalty program that now has massed over 7 million members worldwide. We feel great about the brands' ability that offset more normalized promotional activity through a strategic shift in channel mix, which also helped reduce marketplace inventories heading into the spring 2023 season. We expect UGG to finish the fiscal year in a position of strength as demand for the brands' compelling products that are resonating with consumers globally has never been stronger. Shifting to HOKA. Global revenue for the third was $352 million, representing an increase of 91% versus last year on a reported basis. Another quarterly revenue record for HOKA. Just two quarters ago, we celebrated HOKA achieving $1 billion of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and with the quarter just delivered, the brand has now eclipsed $1 billion of revenue over the last nine months, ended December 2022. HOKA growth in the third quarter was driven by share gains with one specialty account in the wholesale channel as product flow improved this year relatively to last, allowing HOKA to increase sell through, added points of distribution with select strategic accounts as the brand has been slowly expanding throughout the year, global DTC revenue more than doubling versus last year, as consumer acquisition and retention increased 95% and 109%, respectively. And a favorable comparable period as wholesale shipments were disrupted in the prior year due primarily to port congestion. We believe the Fly Human Fly marketing campaign has been a key catalyst for the HOKA brands' DTC strength throughout the year which has driven a higher growth rate than wholesale on each quarter thus far this fiscal year. During the third quarter, targeted marketing activations in Chicago and New York City helped drive a 22% increase in brand awareness, a 27% in consideration and a 33% increase on purchase intent in these markets over the next six months. We also believe these markets have seen a halo effect from the additional brand visibility created by popup stores which have continued to perform well for HOKA. In particular, we saw a significant gains among 18 to 34 year old consumers, who in the US and EMEA drove the largest year-over-year increase of any age group during the third quarter. We have been increasingly encouraged by the broad product adoption from females in this coveted demographic, who appeared to be actively searching hoka.com for what is new and exciting on a regular basis. Giving us confidence and the investments we're making to build brand awareness globally. The all new [Solimar] [ph], our cross trainer is the perfect example of this trend. The Solimar launched earlier this fall without significant marketing dedicated to the shoe, but still landed in a top five of styles purchased by females aged 18 to 34 years old in this quarter. HOKA is also resonating well with males in this demographic, but we see a great deal of more opportunity to further expose the brands' product depths by testing access points to specialize and serving this target consumer. Importantly, even with the expansion beyond run specialty distribution, the brand has hyper-focused on delivering in that core channel as well. According to aggregated US run specialty store data, during December, HOKA increased market share by 5 percentage points versus last year, delivered the highest average product turns and maintain a gross margin well above the channel average. In terms of our wholesale partner access points in the third quarter, we are extremely proud of the HOKA brands' performance as that continued to build market share in a highly competitive marketplace. With the strength of consumer demand for the brand, HOKA was able to maintain its high percentage of full-price business even with the incremental access points with strategic accounts. Though early days in some of the brands' new doors, the feedback on HOKA performance has been exceptional. On the product side, HOKA has continued to introduce award-winning footwear, in October, HOKA was featured in the 2022 Men's Health Sneaker Awards with Bondi 8 being chosen for the most comfortable cushion, and the Kaha 2 GORE-TEX noted as the best hiking sneaker boot. In addition, Outside Magazine published its Winter Gear Guide for 2023, selecting the Mafate Speed 4 as the best shoe for fast in rugged trail runs. All of us at Deckers are excited for what is to come for the HOKA brand, starting with a couple of innovative product launches planned for the fourth quarter and more to come in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. In terms of consolidated channel performance in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in both global DTC and wholesale, but the majority of revenue growth was driven by global DTC which increased 19% versus last year on a reported basis, and 22% on a DTC comparable basis. DTC's strength was driven by impressive global consumer acquisition and retention across the entire portfolio, which increased 44% and 38%, respectively. From a dollar growth perspective, global HOKA DTC volume more than doubled and UGG DTC increased 8% on a reported basis versus the prior year, driving over $100 million of combined incremental revenue. On the wholesale side, consolidated global revenue increased 8% on a reported basis versus last year. Growth was driven by HOKA brand market share gains and existing points of distribution as well as incremental business from added doors with select strategic accounts. For the total portfolio, the increased HOKA volume was partially offset by lower wholesale shipments for UGG, where the brand focused on selling through existing inventory to reduce the need for promotional activity. Evidencing this success and illustrating the underlying brand heat during the season, UGG wholesale units sell through in the US increased mid-single-digits in fall \u201822 as compared to fall 2021. With the exceptional demand our brands were able to capture through DTC combined with a strategic actions taken on the UGG wholesale front, our third quarter DTC mix increased from 50% last year to 52% this year. In the third quarter, our brands achieved the highest DTC mix ever for our historically largest quarter, which represents great progress towards our long-term objective of a 50% mix of DTC business to the entire fiscal year across the portfolio. Alongside our disciplined omnichannel approach, I would like to share out our amazing design teams that continually bring compelling new products to market. The combination of these talented teams create the exceptional experience with our products that consumers have come to love and expect from our brands. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide further details on the third quarter performance and an update on our fiscal year 2023 guidance. Thanks, Steve. We are proud of our strong results and ability to navigate a challenged consumer landscape through our marketplace managing strategies tailored to each of our unique brands. Exiting the holiday season, we are encouraged by and have great confidence in the strength of our brands and the exciting future ahead. With the brand heat we're seeing on HOKA and UGG in particular, we feel Deckers is well positioned. Both brands operate on a pull model, and we believe the strong relationships our brands have built with key wholesale partners will serve us well. Deckers' strategic brand marketplace management, omnichannel capabilities and flexible operating model continue to be the driving forces behind our company's sustained success. But Deckers' success is ultimately made possible by the hardworking employees who go above and beyond to deliver consistent results aligned with our long-term strategic goals. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to sharing more as we continue to build towards Deckers' exciting future. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yep \u2013 Welcome. Yeah, you're talking about second half or Q3, Q4? What specifically are you talking about the quarter? Yeah, I let Steve get into specifics. But I think you know, a lot of this and he will explain this in more detail as the call goes on. But it's just the timing of deliveries versus last year. So that's the big part of the dynamic and then shifts between Q3 and Q4. But Steve I don't know if you have more color on that. Yeah, and I think just as a reminder, you know, Q3 last year, we were in some cases starved for inventory. And we, you know, brought inventory that we could have sold in Q3 brought in in Q4 for both UGG and HOKA, and the wholesalers were happy to take it at that time, and particularly for UGG, they were happy to fill up on kind of core styles, knowing that they would carry it into Q3 this year, and that dynamic has played out. But now we're comping, you know, those increased shipments in Q4 last year. But overall, as Steve said, the brands are very healthy, full price sales throughout our wholesale partners is strong and the demand from them is still there. But keep in mind, they're also working through you know, inventory situation, a lot of promotional activity in the marketplace, and then working through their own inventory. So they're careful about who they bring in for brands. And fortunately, our brands are very, very strong. So they're prioritizing us, but they still have a lot of inventory from other brands to work through in this environment. Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that. And this is, you know, I would say on a global scale, we are very selective of who we sell HOKA to in wholesale. We're always prioritizing the run specialty channel, that's our bread and butter and the authenticity of the brand. But you know, we're strong in places like REI, we've expanded doors index in the third quarter. And as we mentioned in the call that's growing very well. We're in a handful of footlocker doors, but right now we're not really looking to expand too many more doors in wholesale, we're focused on healthy sell through and expanding categories. And then, you know, as we saw in Q3, DTC is exceptionally strong. And we want to continue to you know, drive the growth strategically in wholesale, create awareness, get in front of the right consumers, but ultimately drive as much business as we can through DTC, because for all the right reasons, margin, consumer data, lifetime value. So it's a healthy balance and this is a good reflection of our strategy towards ultimately being a 50% DTC company, you can see how this is working in this quarter. You bet. Yeah, I can share with you my inbox of emails of people looking for those styles. So you know, I think to take it up to a higher level as we're managing through our inventory in the UGG brand you know, we pulled back a little bit on how much we invested in some of these new styles, not anticipating how strong the consumer demand for them would be. So you know, the platform styles, the Tas, the Ultra Mini, those styles, you know, in many cases sold out to the piece. And so, we missed some opportunity there. The good news is that wholesalers want more, the consumer wants more. And we've realized that these extended Classics, you know, in more iterations of core classics would keep our brand DNA intact, are resonating very, very well with particularly younger consumers. But I would say all consumers, and then on a global scale. So you know, you can feel confident that we're going to continue on that path and developing these styles, take advantage of the platform trends, et cetera as we continue through the year and beyond. So, good news is that you know core classics remain strong and healthy. But some of these new iterations were better than we expected. Which is great news. And you know, there's demand on the table and the consumer is hungry for. Yep. Thanks, Jon. So yeah, on the HOKA side, you know, we're very happy with these results. I think, in the early days of HOKA, you know, we were selling obviously to core runners and beyond, and then some people were using it for, you know, comfort and longevity reasons. And the younger consumers weren't really adopting it as part of their own yet, but we've seen that shift \u2013 change dramatically in the last year or so, you know, in the 18 to 34 year old category was our fastest growing consumer segment. So it's working as, you know, as we planned, probably a little better than we planned, tapping a little faster than we planned. But some of the activities we're doing, the collabs with folks like free people, et cetera, marketing, but you're seeing, you know, teenage girls and boys trading from traditional athletic brands into HOKA, and raving about it. So it's very exciting. And it just expands the breadth of our brand from ages, you know, 18 to 80. And I think that marketing and the product teams are doing an exceptional job of creating right product for that consumer, putting it in the right place, and showcasing it the right way. And some of the extended work we're doing on the lifestyle side, taking core styles, but you know, different treatments, different materials, different colors that are more kind of lifestyle focused, that's working extremely well, too. So we think that this is a big unlock for the brand long-term. We want to be healthy and meaningful and important to this younger consumer. And we're seeing that play out, which is really great. Yeah, and I think you know, from a consumer perspective, you know, they don't know the quarterly ins and outs, but they're seeing the product it's selling through very well at full price and the demand is certainly there. You know, and I think you have to pull back and look at the full year results of this brand, and especially the way both of our brands and Q3 performed in a very challenging environment, FX pressures, promotional environment, and to come out with this rate of high level \u2013 high price, full price sell through, healthy margins, and still momentum and demand in the marketplace. You know, that's what we're focused on. And so, we see this continuing and the brands as I said before, I've never been in a better place the brand heat that we see. And UGG and HOKA are exceptional and we're going to continue to build on that. And, you know, invest in these brands for the long-term. And particularly, international. Thanks, Jon. Yeah, good questions. I would say for HOKA, the majority of the growth is coming from existing accounts, you know, outside of, you know, some expansion in Q3 in Dick's stores, there really wasn't a lot of expansion in new doors globally. So, you know, we're continuing to gain market share, you saw that in their pre-recorded comments. And that's happening, you know, across the board. It's not just a run specialty. So, strong full price sell through, healthy margins for the retailers, great presentations in wholesale. But we're getting better at it as we go and the wholesale accounts are realizing the power of this brand. And so the majority of that is coming from existing accounts at this point, which again, goes back to the brand marketplace management and just, you know, speaking to the right consumer. What was the other question, sorry? The pricing. Yes, sorry. You know, we have raised prices in both brands this past Q3 and coming into the fall period, and we didn't see any, really any resistance to that, you know, obviously evidenced by the sellout of some of these UGG styles and some of the price increases in HOKA, we haven't really seen a slowdown in sell through. And so I think the product is worth it. The brand is, you know, meaningful and important to these consumers. And they were willing to pay full price even though some of the prices were higher. Yeah, I think it was like overall is about 8% across both brands. On lifestyles. Correct, sorry, yeah. No. In UGG when we're also doing, you know more slippers and Tasmans that a little bit lower priced than the Classic and some of the Minis you know, it may affect the total average price across the board. But you know, I think we're providing excellent value and quality for the price and I think the consumer sees that and it's resonating strongly with them and willing to pay it. Thank you. Yeah, I mean certainly we're still dealing with normalization of the business, you know, from COVID and some of that is related to refilling the marketplace of inventory coming off the peak, balancing that out. And so you know, right now, where we sit right now, we're probably looking at low-single-digits, just to be prudent and as we reset the marketplace. You know, I am very excited about the product pipeline and the new leadership under Anne and the way the design teams and the marketing teams are collaborating globally for this brand, you know, we're getting better at this every day. And so I think the opportunity is there, but we're still trying to navigate and make sure we set the marketplace correctly. Right now, it's extremely well managed globally. The inventories are clean and healthy. We have some inventory a little bit to work through here and there. But the long-term outlook for this brand, I think is exciting. But I would say where we sit now in the shorter-term, it's you know we're looking at low-single-digits, knowing that the environment and the global macroeconomic situation is still a little bit challenged. Different than HOKA, because that's, you know, more of a hyper growth. And so a lot of people haven't heard of the brand yet across the globe or UGG is obviously a household name. And it's about fine-tuning the product assortment being meaningful to each of the consumer segments, and managing the marketplace globally, while driving a healthy DTC business to improve margins. Thank you. Yeah, and I would say from a channel perspective, you know, I think the channel is in good place with the inventory. You know, we were able to fill the bucket, so to speak in UGG last year, and we're getting back inventory in key styles in HOKA. So I think it's in a very healthy place and that's reflected in, you know, how DTC exceeded wholesale growth in the quarter. Still healthy sell throughs globally. So again, credit to the teams you know managing the marketplace in this environment. But I would say, you know, from a brand health and a marketplace and a market channel perspective, things are in good shape. And, you know, in addition to what Steve said about how we're managing and our number on levels. You bet. Yeah, I think you know, what you're looking at a little bit is some of those launches in Q4 had to ship in Q3 to be in the marketplace that, you know, in time and no. And then also, I talked about the Solimar. And also the new transit that just launched today, those are small buys and small volume drivers in a first introduction, so heavily weighted on DTC, you know, wholesalers, you know, want to see performance in your own channels before they invest heavily. So, yes, they're exciting. Yes, they're new. Yes, they'll steal some market share from competitors. But the scale of those on the business at this point are still small. And then some of that inventory has also shipped in Q3, which is why you see the 90% increase. Yeah, I mean, I think DTC, you know, there was exceptional results in DTC in Q3, you know, as we said, some of those you know really hot styles have sold out and we are selling fumes, the golden stars with a new introduction in Q4 that is already selling out. So there's hot demand for some of these styles. But as we've been managing our inventory levels, we didn't buy as heavily into some of these new styles yet, not anticipating that kind of sell through. On the wholesale side, you know, yeah, they still have inventory leftover from what they purchased throughout the year. More than kind of the core classics, they're still struggling with the hot new styles, you know just like we are in DTC, what you're going to see it down, you know, in the 20%, 30% range for the quarter. But again, if you look at the market sell through and the health of the brand in the marketplace, that's what we're focused on and you know it's tough. I understand you're trying to model quarters, but it's a funky dynamic wonky as one person already said, and but I think we got to go back to like, what is the health of this brand and how are things selling through? Yeah \u2013 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, sure. You know, it's hard to comment on things right now in this quarter. But you know, I think coming out of the year-to-date so far in China, listen, I give our teams over there, the leadership and management team, the way they have managed the last three years in that marketplace with all the challenges from COVID and lockdowns, and you know, consumers not being able to spend, I think we're in you know, exceptional shape and our brands as considering the marketplace. So the brands, you know, are strong, they're healthy, they're in demand, the marketing tactics that we're employing for both brands over there being more locally relevant, the collabs that we're doing in UGG, the fashion partnerships, reaching in younger consumer, those are all checking boxes and performing extremely well. You know, I think what you'll start to see, and I was talking to the China team the other night, you're going to start to see consumers come back out. And we feel really good about our chances, you know, for the finish of this year and heading into next year. Keep in mind that, you know, China isn't a massive business for us yet, we do have long-term aspirations. But I think we're going to see that consumer come back not only domestically but globally. And that'll be an interesting dynamic for us and other brands. But we like the way we're set up the like, we like the way we're managing the marketplace, the way we're resourcing it, and then specifically to HOKA you know, so far so good. We've invested in our own stores, we're working with partners on door expansion, creating awareness in the marketplace in an authentic way. And we're going to continue on that path because we see just tremendous opportunity for HOKA in the long-term. And so far, we're seeing good signs from our partners and our retail stores and gives us a lot of confidence that this can be a big success over time. You bet."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Adding to Dave's remarks, I would like to express how encouraged we are with the performance of our brands as we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment. We are fortunate that our two largest brands are very healthy and proving resilience in a highly competitive marketplace, due primarily to their differentiated and compelling product offering. While HOKA continues to drive incredible growth as again shown in this quarter, UGG was able to deliver relatively flat reported revenue, as compared to last year's record revenue in a much more difficult consumer and macroeconomic environment that included a significant foreign exchange rate impact. In constant currency, the UGG brand delivered growth of low-single-digits in the quarter. Our organization's continued commitment to long-term strategic decision-making and disciplined approach to spending in an unchartered environment propelled Deckers to yet another record quarter. Now, let's get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance. Third quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $1.346 billion, representing an increase of 13% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 17.5% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of HOKA, which more than doubled its global DTC business through impressive increases in consumer acquisition and online retention, and increased wholesale revenue by 83% versus last year due to market share gains and select increased points of distribution with strategic partners. HOKA also benefited from an easier comparison to last year's third quarter when wholesale shipments were disrupted by inventory delays that resulted from port congestion. Gross margin for the third quarter was 53%, which is up 70 basis points from last year's 52.3%. The most material drivers of gross margin in the quarter were a significant benefit from reduced freight costs, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the prior year period. Additional gross margin impacts in the quarter included benefits from favorable channel mix with DTC growing faster than wholesale, favorable brand mix as the sales of our HOKA brand increased and price increases implemented at the end of last year. These were partially offset from more normalized promotions and closeout activity for UGG relative to minimal discounting last year. SG&A dollar spent in the third quarter was $350 million, up 7% versus last year's $328 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 160 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to benefits in the quarter from foreign currency remeasurement. But it still remains a headwind in the fiscal year-to-date through December, and a lower ratio of marketing to sales as we shifted the timing of HOKA campaign spent into the fourth quarter to align with the launch of spring 2023. Our tax rate was 23.7%, which is higher than last year's 20.5% primarily due to jurisdictional mix of business. These results combined with favorable interest income relative to last year, and a lower share count drove earnings per share to $10.48, which is more than $2 and 24% higher than last year's $8.42 per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31st, 2022, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.058 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $723 million, up 31% versus the same point in time last year, primarily to support the continued growth of the HOKA brand, which was light on inventory in the prior year due to factory delays, with some offset from UGG inventory being down year-over-year, and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $45 million worth of shares at an average price of $350.25. As of December 31st, 2022, the company had approximately $1.46 billion of remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now, moving to our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2023. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be up 11% to 12% from our previous range of up 10% to 11%. This increase now equates to a full year revenue range of $3.50 billion to $3.53 billion. This is being driven by HOKA upside as the brand continues to exceed expectations in DTC and build market share across global wholesale access points. Reflecting this update, HOKA growth is now expected to increase in the low 50% range for the fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, implying more than $450 million of incremental revenue versus last year. The HOKA brands increased fiscal year revenue guide now implies a second half growth rate in the high 40% to low 50% range, with total dollar volume that is slightly greater than the first half, reflecting the brands' balanced revenue across the year. Due to last year's supply chain disruption that impacted quarterly wholesale revenue timing, the HOKA brands' growth rate in the fourth quarter will be lower than the brands' typical run rate. With that said, we expect to see continued robust DTC demand from consumers driving strong growth in that channel. UGG revenue is still expected to be down mid-single-digits on a reported basis, implying a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter as the brand laps abnormal events in the prior year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, UGG had late arriving fall inventory, which wholesale customers would historically cancel, but instead they kept their orders preferring to procure inventory on the earlier side for the future seasons. This resulted in additional growth in the prior year fourth quarter that is not expected to be repeated. Additionally, UGG DTC benefited from backorder product that shipped in January last year. Further, of all our brands, UGG is the most globally exposed brand, and as a result, continues to face the most significant headwinds from an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as compared to last year. Beyond our increased revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2023, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 50.5%, SG&A as a percentage of sales is still expected to be approximately 33%; operating margin is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Our effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%. And our increased diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $18 to $18.50. As a reminder, due to the disruptive nature of how the second half of last year played out, the company pushed hard to improve the availability of our products earlier this year, and that strategy has served us well, and due to this push, more products shipped earlier this year, and that, combined with currency headwinds have placed pressure on the reported percentage growth in the fourth quarter. With that said, we believe viewing our increased expectation for the full fiscal year more holistically is a better measure of the progress our brands are making. In this context, we are delivering on what we said and have continued to increase our full fiscal year outlook, despite a harsher impact from foreign currency fluctuations, as compared to initial expectations at the outset of this year. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressure, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the US dollar and geopolitical tensions. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, I wanted to provide further context around the state of our business. On Logistics, the level of disruption, delays and corresponding freight costs relative to the same point in time last year has continued to improve, though they remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. While the ongoing outbreak in China is not currently impacting footwear production or transit times in a material way. We are experiencing some minimal operational hurdles, and we'll continue to watch this situation closely. In terms of inventory, we've continued to see improvement in the ratio of inventory growth to sales growth over the last few quarters, as was signaled in our expectations throughout this year. While still working to optimize levels, we feel good about our current inventory position, which is up over last year to satisfy increased HOKA demand. We still anticipate unique year-over-year comparisons based on disruption in the supply chain, as well as the dynamics of the HOKA brands' increasing mix of both revenue and inventory, especially as it's more even quarterly revenue cadence compared to UGG. Regarding promotional activity, as we have discussed over the last few quarters, the marketplace has become increasingly influenced by higher levels of markdown activity. While our brands have maintained a high percentage of full price business, there has been a return to more normalized levels of promotion experienced prior to the pandemic, particularly with the UGG brand. HOKA has largely avoided additional discounting beyond the historical model update flow. Given the dynamics of the marketplace, which is dealing with higher channel inventory, we are well positioned having managed inventory into the wholesale channel, while leveraging our DTC capabilities, selling earlier and at higher margins, gaining share and exceeding our original expectations on the year. On currency, we've continued to experience impacts on our results from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting an approximate impact of $20 million to revenue, and our expected headwind for the full fiscal year 2023 remains at approximately $100 million. Finally, as we finish out our fiscal year 2023 and look to deliver another exceptional year, we are also reflecting on the actions we took to manage our expense base and the tradeoffs made to deliver these results. While we are not yet providing guidance for fiscal year 2024, and as our business expands, we will continue to review and invest in those areas that will drive the organization forward, especially as we start to see gross margin expansion. In this highly competitive environment, those further investments will support talent, innovation, technology, and enterprise infrastructure, which are all critical to our continued success. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. We can hear you. Yeah. I think you know, when we get into the quarterly discussion, it's a little bit about what we alluded to at the beginning of the year. We knew that given \u2013 coming out again, Q4, just to remind everyone, where we shipped product last year in Q4, that was going to impact Q3 and Q4 of this year in terms of wholesale growth. So we took the opportunity to sell products in. We had wholesale customers participating and wanting to hold some of that product that they didn't sell in Q4, which we knew would impact Q3 and Q4 of this year. So I think, as we see Q3 and Q4 play out, it's much to our expectation and a little bit better, which is why we are increasing our full year outlook. We knew kind of between quarters, there would be some disruption in the current year, again, why we didn't guide quarterly. But I think continuing to see strong demand with our wholesalers. This is a bit of you know impact from pandemic and supply chain disruption experienced last year, still playing through this year. It is impacting how we see wholesale growth in the current year, but we knew that, right and it goes a little bit back to the point I made in the prepared remarks, which was, we were going to take every opportunity to get products in early in the year to make sure that we have an opportunity for strong sell through during the season, which is exactly what we've seen. And our brands continue to perform well and resonate with customers. So both on the UGG side, and especially as you can see in the numbers on the HOKA side. So, again, really pleased with our performance, again, don't want to get hung up on quarterly percentage changes, because really, we're measuring the health of the business on the year and that's our outlook on the race for the year. Yeah, and Jon, this is Steve. On the Q3, Q4 HOKA dynamic. Again, it goes back to a little bit, you know, we're dealing with disruptive supply chain last year, right. So there's a dynamic on the year-over-year comparison in Q3 and Q4. Then to your point on kind of Q4 versus Q3 this year. As we've had more inventory availability, we've been putting that into the marketplace. At the same time you know, we know as Dave said, there is more product in the marketplace. So we want to control the marketplace. You know, we'll look and see how the brand continues to grow, it's going to continue to grow a little bit disproportionate in percentage terms, again, because of how we're making those comparisons to last year. But this is a little bit to our marketplace management. We also have new models that are being introduced in Q4. So there's some change in some of the wholesale deliveries in the quarter. But again, this is a brand that's continuing to grow overall solid growth plan for the year, a little bit choppy between quarters, you know, and strong demand that we continue to see, that wholesalers are demanding product. So, managing the DTC business, managing the wholesale business, managing the marketplace, recognizing what's going on there. I wouldn't get too concerned over the Q3, Q4 dynamic. You know, we've just got choppy quarters going on in this year. And then I think just the last thing and we'll move on, but, you know, I think the demand that we're seeing for HOKA is highlighted in again, our raise for our full year outlook. So that raise is being driven by the increased demand that we're seeing from HOKA. You know, again, just speaking to the strength we continue to see with HOKA and how it's resonating in the marketplace. Yeah, yeah. The pricing? On the lifestyle. So like again, we didn't do \u2013 we didn't raise price on every \u2013 We raised price on certain select styles but today's point that was called around 8% of the styles. And it wasn't all at the beginning of the year. It was some styles on HOKA at the beginning of the year, and then it was some products in UGG on the fall season. The pricing is up a little bit, but not I wouldn't say significantly different. Yeah, Tom this is Steve, I'll take that one. And you know, we're not giving guidance yet. And it going a little bit to what I said in the prepared remarks. And so, we are experiencing improvements in gross margin, you've seen it in Q3 as you model it in, you'll see it in Q4, where that's largely coming from the freight. So you are right, we're seeing freight rates come down. In the current quarter, Q4, we're going to benefit from that, we're seeing that increase. Overall, there still is, you know, an FX headwind. So for the year, as you can see in our guidance, we are lower on a gross margin basis, we'll continue to see some improvement with ocean freight, but it's going to be at lower levels than what you're seeing come through in the current quarter. So there will be to your point a little bit of a tailwind, we'll see what happens with currency, right. Currencies turned more beneficial to us. It's in kind of mid-to-late Q3. We're seeing some of that, but it's still down from a year ago. So to your point, we'll see what happens. There is a potential there, you know, for some improvements that could contribute to the gross margin. But as I also said, you know, we've tightened our belt this year to deliver on what we guided, we've held off on some investments within the business to continue to deliver within that range of guidance, and so we're evaluating it. And while we haven't given guidance on next year, we do expect there will be some gross margin expansion. And we're going to use that to invest in the business, especially in the competitive nature of where this business is and what we're doing with our brands. And so that investment is critical to keeping us relevant and leading in this space. So that is clearly something we are going to do with some of that gross margin expansion. Now, as I've said before, right, when there's an opportunity, we see strong businesses their opportunity to reflect some of that upside. Yeah, and we did do that a couple of years ago. But first, we're going to make sure that we're looking at some of this gross margin expansion, investing it in the business because it's proving well, we're delivering exceptional results. We're well above many of our peers in terms of operating profit. So we got to keep continuing to invest in this business. So, yeah, there is, but you know, there's also investments that we have to make them in business. Thank you. Yeah, I think the \u2013 so speaking to our inventory, we, you know, this is something we indicated at the beginning of the year, that it was something that we would be working through this year. And I think we've demonstrated that, inventory levels have improved. As we've said in the prepared remarks, again, inventory level on UGG actually decreased, again, signaling some of the work that we've been doing and the improvement efforts that we've been making. You know, what we're also doing is increasing our HOKA inventory. So when you got a quarter that's growing 90%, you got to have inventory to service those sales. So we have been increasing inventory. You know, I think in terms of as we look out further, there's still opportunity to optimize inventory levels. But when we look at the relationship of inventory to sales growth it's coming much more in line, we feel comfortable about our inventory, there's always room for a little bit of improvement, we'll continue to work on that improvement, as things begin to normalize, especially with the supply chain. But where we sit today with everything that's going on with the growth of our brands, we feel comfortable about our inventory positions, and we'll continue to work to optimize those levels. And I think John answered that question, right. So when you take the numbers in, given what we sold in as well as what we sold through our DTC, we're not expecting that on \u2013 growth on Q3. Again, we've got dynamics that are underlying between quarters, right. And that's why I want to be careful that people aren't so focused on Q3, Q4, as I said, we're managing this business for the year. It's why we have not this year, given quarterly guidance. We know we've got dynamics within quarters this year, where we're trying to get more products in early. And that, as I said before, has worked well for us, right. So we want to make sure we have you know the right perspective of how the business is trending. Now, when you then look at mix, right. That's going to play an impact on revenue reported. So when we're looking at volumes, right volumes are a little bit different due to the channels that we're selling in. Our guide equates to similar volume levels. But again, I want to be careful that people aren't so focused on a Q3, Q4 dynamics. It's the full year right and you know, we're coming out of a quarter where we grew the brand 90%, there is demand out there. So, again, we're going to get product in, we're going to get it in there, we want to make sure it has an opportunity to sell through, and then we'll see what happens. And then again, we have tremendous confidence in HOKA. And \u2013 but at the same time, we're managing the marketplace. We know that there are a lot of competitors that have a lot of inventory within the wholesale channel, we don't need to contribute to that confusion, we've got a brand that's red hot that continues to perform well, this goes to our marketplace management. So brand is in great shape. I don't want people to get worked up about a Q3, Q4 dynamic. That's not what we're talking about. Well, again, I mean, the UGG costs of being down in Q4, you have so much that shifted from Q3 to Q4 last year, and you brought more of it in Q3 this year. And so that's not really \u2013 that's a different scenario than health. That's not expected. It's just more a matter of trying to triangulate where it is. Thank you. You bet."

With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss the strong results delivered by our portfolio of compelling brands as we make continued strides towards our long-term strategic vision even amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment. For the second quarter, revenue increased 21% versus prior year to $876 million. In the quarter, our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA drove compelling revenue growth of 6% and 58%, respectively. Steve will provide further details on the strength of our second quarter later in the call. But for now, I'd like to focus on how our first half results demonstrate Decker's progress towards longer term goals. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through strategic investments, while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability for the company overall. With the continued focus on moving our in-demand products into the marketplace early ahead of the UGG brand's peak selling season, and while at the same time, fueling year-round demand for the HOKA brand, we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far against our annual outlook of the current fiscal year. As we continue to track our progress, I reflect on the first half results of fiscal 2023, which thus far have delivered consolidated revenue growth of 21% versus last year and 64% versus two years ago, HOKA revenue growth of 57% versus last year, with the brand now representing 44% of consolidated revenue, up from 35% last year and 28% two years ago; UGG revenue growth of 3% versus last year, with international driving growth aligned with our strategy despite currency headwinds and a 63% increase in DTC acquisition versus last year for HOKA, and a 54% increase for reflecting the strength of the demand of our brands, which propelled revenue growth of 26% for the first half. Results like this demonstrate the success of Deckers\u2019 multi-pronged approach to creating growth and proactively managing our brands to progress towards our long-term vision while delivering quality profitability. Deckers is able to deliver on our objectives while managing through external factors because of our flexible operating model, omnichannel capabilities and our nimble organization. Our compelling brands are well-positioned for the second half of the fiscal year, and I'm confident in the team's ability to continue executing. Steve will provide further details on our updated thoughts on guidance and the macroeconomic environment later in the call. But for now, let's dive into the brand and channel performance highlights for the second quarter and first half. Starting with UGG. As a reminder, Anne Spangenberg joined our company earlier this year to leave the Fashion Lifestyle group, which includes the UGG and Koolaburra brands. With her a wealth of experience, Anne is already having an impressive impact on UGG, as a leader with passion and a clear vision that puts the consumer at the center of everything the brand is doing, it aligned with the UGG brand strategy implemented over the last few years, Anne is focused on refining a few key elements of the brand's approach to product and demand creation, which include expanding the base of UGG consumers through a clear strategic vision of brand purpose and experience, prioritizing the design DNA of UGG in the product proposition, editing and focusing UGG products and experiences to maximize consumer impact and elevating the pinnacle expression of UGG. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Anne's vision integrated into the UGG brand's bright future ahead. Moving to UGG brands first half results. Global revenue in the second quarter increased 6% versus last year to $477 million. For the first half, UGG revenue increased 3% over the prior year. We've been talking for some time about the diversification of UGG product and the brand's focus on developing franchises to complement core Classics. The UGG product team has done a fantastic job, broadening the consumer appeal beyond Classics, while also ensuring Classics remain the pinnacle expression of UGG. Keeping Classics special essential to our UGG marketplace allocation and segmentation strategy that spans multiple countries and critical to UGG maintaining high levels of brand interest around the world. From a product standpoint, UGG has quite literally elevated core Classics through the introduction of fashion forward platform versions of the brand's most iconic styles, generating tremendous press coverage from being spotted on top models and going viral on TikTok. Platform Classics are already trending in the top 10 amongst new consumers in 18 to 34-year olds, and the fall season is just getting started. Additionally, with excitement building around the platforms, we've also seen a significant demand uptick in the original core Classics that inspired them, as DTC revenue from the Classics Ultra Mini and the Classic Mini in the first half increased more than 200% and more than 60% versus last year, respectively. Beyond Classics, UGG has continued to find success with hybrid styles, of which the latest and greatest example has been the Tasman. For the first half of this year, the Tasman has been a top five style for UGG overall and the number one style purchase at DDC. We've been encouraged to see the Tasman being adopted as a genderless style, a movement being led by the UGG brand's 18 to 34-year-old cohort as the second most popular and most popular style among female and male consumers in the age group, respectively. Further to the Tasman's popularity and the prevalence of platforms, UGG introduced a platform Tazz last year, and the style is already in the top 10 amongst 18 to 34-year olds. We're excited about the continued opportunity with this franchise as it speaks to the UGG brand's growing year on appeal and increased category diversification. Driving the success of an early attention to UGG this fall, with the brand team's enhanced global marketing campaign strategy that leans into the consumer feedback derived from a recent brand survey. With concrete consumer feedback across the eight global markets provided by the surveys, UGG designed this year's campaign dubbed Feels Like UGG, to deliver a unified brand message via local influencers that were cast specifically for each of these individual key markets, which leans into the feeling and comfort that are core to the brand's DNA. Beginning with an influencer event in Paris that coincided with the UGG collaboration with opening ceremony and continuing on to a collaboration with 6pm that was featured during Fashion Week Milan, the Feels Like UGG campaign was launched on the runway and broadcast globally through social engagement by a community of ambassadors and consumers who love the brand. We are seeing tremendous response from consumers thus far, as in the second quarter, search interest for the US increased 11% versus last year, with two-thirds of the ugg.com visitors new to the site, 18 to 34-year old site visitors in EMEA more than doubled versus last year, Asia Pacific DTC business grew 11% versus last year, and global DTC retention increased 50% versus the prior year. The consumer response has been positive globally for the UGG brand. First half revenue was driven by international regions as the US lap significant wholesale refill activity from the prior year. Additionally, some of this year-to-date growth overseas is due to lapping supply chain latency in the first half of last year, but we feel the UGG brand's international regions returning to growth is proof of the successful marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the last few years. All-in-all, the UGG brand is positioned well for holiday with inventory availability having improved relative to last year in key markets across the globe. We're encouraged by the results we've seen early in the season, but as always, remain cautious with our busiest period still to come. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue for the second quarter increased 58% versus last year for $333 million, a quarterly revenue record for HOKA, leading to a first half revenue increase of 57% versus last year. HOKA growth continues to be driven by the brand's exceptional global ecosystem of access points, which is building market share through increased awareness and benefiting from strategic door count increases. While greater market share with existing accounts is responsible for the majority of HOKA growth this year, the brand has made some notable addition to access points, which include expanded distribution with strategic growth accounts, 12 owned and operated stores to build awareness and serve the monobrand China market, two stores in Japan and five pop-up stores in the US. Each of these access points are designed to build HOKA brand awareness and increase consumer access to new geographic locations. In addition, the HOKA brand has rolled out exciting out-of-home FLY HUMAN FLY campaign content in highly visible cities around the world, helping to drive a 145% increase in search terms in New York and Los Angeles. With these efforts, we've seen the HOKA brand's DTC growth rate accelerate from the first quarter into the second. Overall, for the first half, HOKA has driven exceptional increases in DTC retention and acquisition, increasing 70% and 63%, respectively, across global markets. All of these actions are driving incredible increases in brand awareness. Over the last two years, HOKA awareness across all consumers has improved nine percentage points and even crossed the 20% threshold, with awareness among runners even higher according to Decker's proprietary brands tracker study. Outside of the US, awareness is much lower, with most regions sitting in the low teens percentage, but seeing similarly explosive growth and awareness, which highlights the significant opportunity for continued HOKA brand expansion, augmenting the global marketing campaign. HOKA global event sponsorships have continued to help the brand maintain and build performance credibility with extreme athletes around the world. One recent example of this is the HOKA brand sponsorship of the Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc, the UTMB World Series. In the brand's first year sponsoring the UTMB Series, we saw positive results, as HOKA achieved a 34% share of shoes tracked on race participants, which is well-above last year's total. Additionally, HOKA athlete Ludovic Pommeret placed first in 145-kilometer TDS race in this year's UTMB series wearing the HOKA spigot trail shoe to conquer the course's diverse terrain. The HOKA brands alignment with the ultra competitive UTMB series highlights the brand's focus on becoming a leader in the growing outdoor trail and hiking segment. The aforementioned Speedgoat is the HOKA brand's top trail shoe. Coinciding with the UTMB event, in order to complement the Speedgoat, HOKA launched the Mafate Speed 4, which is an innovative update to a heritage style designed to broaden the brand's footprint in trail. Early reads from consumers purchasing the Mafate have been exceptionally strong across global markets, which is exciting for HOKA as the brand focuses on building market share in the trail category. For hiking, HOKA now has two franchises in Kaha and the Anacapa that are experiencing immense growth and building market share. Thus far, in fiscal year 2023, both of these hiking franchises have made their way into the top 10 most purchased styles for HOKA. We believe this is because of the unique HOKA DNA that sets these franchises apart with their lightweight platform and maximum cushion that compares favorably to bulkier products from the competition. Importantly, while we're seeing really strong growth in new categories of focus such as trail and hiking, HOKA is also delivering exceptional growth and results with core running styles like the Bondi. With the support of the increased global brand awareness I mentioned earlier, the brand's launch of the eighth evolution of the flagship Bondi franchise was even more impactful as the Bondi 8 was the top-selling style globally in the second quarter, more than doubled last year's Bondi 7 volume among 18 to 34-year-old consumers. It was a top five DTC style across Decker's entire portfolio of brands for the first half despite just launching in August. With this latest addition, Bondi, the brand's most plush riot got softer and more comfortable. With the lightest HOKA foam to date in an all-new extended shell geometry, featuring rear crash pads that provide a soft and balanced transition built for long distance. In just a few months of selling, the Bondi 8 has already been named the Best Road Running Shoe by both the SELF Certified Sneaker Awards as well as the GQ Fitness Awards. Congratulations to the HOKA team for the continued success and balanced growth across global regions and product categories. We look forward to delivering more exciting and innovative products throughout the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. From a channel performance perspective, the first half was strong in both wholesale and DTC, fueled by a 39% increase in consumer acquisition and 44% increase in retention. First half global direct-to-consumer revenue grew 26% versus last year. HOKA continues to be a significant driver of consolidated DTC growth, and the brand's growth rate even accelerated from the first quarter into the second, overall increasing 66% versus the prior year for the first half. UGG also contributed to the first half DTC growth, as the brand returned to growth in Q2, leading to a 4% increase for the brand in the first half. On wholesale, global revenue in the first half increased 20% versus last year. Strength in the wholesale channel was primarily driven by HOKA gaining global market share and the brand benefiting from select additional doors with strategic accounts. UGG also contributed to first half wholesale growth in the brand's international regions. Our first half performance highlights the strength of our omni-channel marketplace management strategies that have allowed our brands to build market share with strategic retailers, while capturing DTC demand at the same time. And while we continue to see great demand in the marketplace for our brands, as we move into the back half, the environment is evolving quickly, which may present challenges outside of our control. However, our teams are focused on the variables that are within our control as we work towards this year's objectives. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will walk you through further details on second quarter performance, as well as the context of our reaffirmed full year top and bottom line guidance.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the second quarter to finish the first half of fiscal year 2023 in a position of strength. HOKA drove another quarter of exceptional growth, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally. While there is plenty of heavy lifting ahead and we are now operating in our historically largest and most complex fiscal quarter, I'm confident in our team's demonstrated ability to execute on our plans even as macroeconomic challenges persist, most notably the continued strengthening of the US dollar. We will lean on our omni-channel capabilities, flexible operating model and strong balance sheet to remain nimble in navigating any dynamic marketplace shifts that may occur as we provide our brands the opportunity to continue building long-term sustainable market share. Now let's get into the details of the second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $876 million, representing an increase of 21% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 25% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the expansion of HOKA, which increased 58% versus last year, delivering record quarterly revenue of $333 million, and a 20% reported increase in UGG international regions as the brand benefited from marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the past couple of years, as well as lapping disrupted wholesale shipments in the prior year. Gross margin for the second quarter was 48.2%, which is down 270 basis points from last year's 50.9%. Roughly half of the decline in gross margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, with additional impacts from higher promotional activity for UGG as compared to last year's exceptionally low levels with the brand primarily utilizing higher margin DTC closet events to move through excess spring season inventory; higher ocean freight rates, which was partially offset by benefits from a reduction in airfreight usage, HOKA price increases and favorable brand mix with HOKA driving the majority of growth. SG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $294 million, up 23% versus last year's $239 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 50 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to higher advertising spend as a percentage of revenue. Our tax rate was 21.2%, which compares to 20.1% for the prior year. These results culminated in a diluted earnings per share of $3.80 for the quarter, which is $0.14 above last year's $3.66 diluted earnings per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2022, we ended September with $419 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $925 million, up 45% versus the same point in time last year, primarily from HOKA brand as we bring product in to continue momentum with the brand. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of shares at an average price of $290. As of September 30, 2022, the company had approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are reaffirming prior consolidated revenue, operating margin and diluted earnings per share guidance. Our full fiscal year 2023 guidance now includes reaffirmed reported revenue growth of 10% to 11%, anticipating between $3.45 billion and $3.5 billion. With HOKA now expected to increase up to 50% versus last year, helping to offset larger currency headwinds as a result of a continued strengthening of the US dollar. And UGG is expected to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis, primarily due to negative currency impacts. Gross margin now expected to be approximately 50.5%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance, primarily due to increased currency impacts, as well as some additional promotional activity. SG&A as a percentage of sales now expected to be approximately 33%, reflecting variable savings to help offset further gross margin pressure that we have now incorporated. Operating margin range is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% and diluted earnings per share is reaffirmed in the range of $17.50 to $18.35. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruption, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changing consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the US dollar and geopolitical tensions. Now, for some additional context on the state of our business as we approach the busiest part of our year. From a logistics standpoint, we are still experiencing delays and the timing of container arrivals remains difficult to predict. But we feel good about the improvement in transit times, which has led to a reduction of inventory in transit on both a dollar and percentage basis as compared to last year. Additionally, I am pleased to report that container costs have come down, but would caution that we won't start to see that improvement in our gross margin for a few quarters. With that said, the headwinds we have experienced from ocean freight in the first half are expected to turn neutral for the remainder of this fiscal year. With the improvement we've seen on transit times and our strategic prioritization to bring inventory in earlier and hold higher levels in the country of sale, we no longer expect to use a material level of air freight in this fiscal year. Additionally, with the strength of our brands and ability to move through some promotional inventory during the quarter, we have seen our year-over-year inventory growth rate moderate as compared to recent quarters, with inventory levels 45% higher as of September 30th, compared to the same date last year, at which point, inventory levels were below normal operating levels. While we are still chasing the exceptional demand for our brands, particularly with the opportunity we've outlined for HOKA, we are likely to see inventory growth outpace sales in part to hedge against future disruption. On the promotional environment, given how clean we have been over the last few years, with very little promotion across our portfolio of brands, we have experienced increased levels of promotion so far this year related to clearing some excess inventory, largely UGG spring season product and shifts in the macroeconomic environment. Embedded in our updated guidance for the full year, we expect more promotional activity relative to the exceptionally low level of promotion in prior years. Further on gross margin, I'd like to touch on currency as this has increasingly been a topic of interest. For the first half, we have seen a currency revenue impact to the tune of approximately $30 million and a 110 basis point impact to gross margin. With our business being second half weighted and no signs of a weakening dollar, we are anticipating a second half revenue impact of approximately $70 million, primarily impacting the UGG brand. In total, we now expect currency to negatively impact our gross margin rate by approximately 140 basis points for the full fiscal year 2023. This increased currency headwind is the primary driver of our change in our updated gross margin outlook. As our top and bottom line guidance has been maintained, despite the continued strengthening of the US dollar being incorporated, we are reflecting an underlying operational raise from our variable levers to remain on track with our original full year outlook. Excluding the negative impact of currency now projected in fiscal 2023, our guidance would indicate gross and operating margin expansion in comparison to the prior fiscal year. This currency neutral margin expansion would be driven by reduced airfreight usage, competitive marketplace price increases and brand mix benefits with the growth of HOKA being partially offset by first half ocean freight pressures, as well as increased promotional activity. Though clearly, there is much to overcome for the balance of our fiscal year, I am confident in the strength of our brands and ability to leverage our flexible operating model to deliver the compelling guidance we set out at the outset of this fiscal year. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. We are excited about the strong results delivered in the first half of fiscal year 2023. But again, it's important to acknowledge that we are still operating within an uncertain environment where things can change quickly, and the bulk of our fiscal year is still ahead. With that said, Deckers is fortunate to have two of the strongest brands in the footwear space that continue to engage and attract new consumers every day. The UGG brand's diverse product assortment is positioned well for holiday, led by elevated platform Classics, which are driving heat and excitement around the core, as well as the continued interest in more transitional hybrid styles like the Tasman and Ultra Mini. Paired with a compelling marketing campaign that is resonating across global markets, we expect UGG to perform well this holiday season. Our powerful brands paired with strategic marketplace management, omni-channel capabilities and disciplined financial management gives me the confidence that our organization can achieve a compelling guidance set forth for fiscal year 2023, even in the face of macro pressures that will impact the broader retail space. Of course, none of this will be possible without the dedication and hard work of our employees, who I'd like to thank in advance of our busiest period of the year. I'd also encourage everyone listening to take a look at our FY 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report that we'll be launching next week and will be posted on deckers.com, further highlighting our company's efforts to do good and do great in the communities where we operate and beyond. Thanks, everybody, for joining us here today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to continue sharing the exciting future ahead at Deckers. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on such solid results in this environment. Dave, Steve, I wanted to ask about the implied 2H rev guide. On a reported basis, it looks like 3%. Maybe on a CC basis, it's about 6%, 7%. Tell me if I'm wrong there. But can you maybe unpack that a bit? How much you're expecting wholesale to grow or not grow versus strength in DTC? And I know, Steve, you don't typically guide by quarter, but any nuances we should consider between 3Q and 4Q? I know you've had shifts in revenues over the years due to shipments. But anything that we should consider as we model the rest of the year?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. Sure, Laurent. So just to give a little bit of perspective on the back half and you're right, we don't give quarterly guidance. So I think how we're seeing the year play out, and I know everybody's models are a little bit different, but it is, I think, laying out to the way we expected, which is much more growth in the first half. So I think, remember the context of last year, our first half was very disruptive in terms of inventory and product availability. And so when you see the big percentage increases in the first half of this year, we are, as we intended to do shipping out more product earlier in the year. That's benefiting clearly HOKA. You can see from the growth numbers, as well as UGG. Last year, as we started to see more inventory coming in, in the second half of the year, it was setting up a bigger half last year. So we are now comping against that bigger half that you saw last year. So that's why you see, from a percentage basis, the second half with lower percentage growth, because we're comparing to get that bigger second half quarter. We're still seeing significant growth with HOKA clearly in our guidance. Again, not quite to the same level of percentage increase. But, remember, we had a very big fourth quarter last year. And that was not only applicable to HOKA, but UGG as well. So, again, we're not breaking out quarters, but as I said, the year is playing out much to our expectation. Embedded in our updated guidance is an operational improvement, and that's largely coming from increases related to HOKA. So we're continuing to see strength. I mentioned it in my updated guidance in terms of now seeing growth for the full year of HOKA up to 50%, so before it was kind of 40%, 45%. So you're seeing that. I think the other thing, remember, is last year was more growth with wholesale, as we were replenishing the channel last year. So we're comping against a replenished year last year in the wholesale business. So you're going to see a slightly lower percentage growth on the wholesale business. But overall, trending very strong, demand signals very strong. The year is playing out well, seeing a strong start to Q3. So, again, as we've said before, and again, this is part of the reason we don't give or did not give quarterly guidance this year is because of the disruptive nature of last year. And we knew that there would be movements between quarters and we knew that first half was going to be much bigger growth this year, with percentage increases, lower but still strong dollar growth in the second half.\nDave Powers: And I would just add on to that. We've been spending a lot of time planning the back half of the year. And we're really proud of the fact that we're able to maintain guidance despite some really significant headwinds on the margin front potentially, from a proportional standpoint, but significant FX headwinds as well. And we've aligned as a leadership team across the organization, and we feel confident that we can still deliver, despite some of these significant headwinds, and that's our objective. And we're going to optimize the strength of our brands right now to deliver its healthy margin and promotional-free season that we can.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much. And then as a second question, a follow-up on UGG. I think, Dave, you mentioned that UGG International grew 20% reported. I'm just going to kind of ballpark it that on a CC basis, it's probably up over 30%. Maybe can you unpack that? What's driving that? Is it Japan? Is it Europe? And then, I guess, maybe the US UGG number was probably down low single digits for this quarter. Was there something with regards to cancellations or just a late start on the DTC side? Anything on that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes, sure. We're really pleased with how things are playing out internationally. We've been working at transitioning those markets much like we did in the US a few years ago and we're starting to see fruits of that work in a positive way, particularly around diversified Classics in the UGG brand and younger consumers. And so, the marketing campaign, the key styles, the platform styles are really resonating well in those regions. But I think a key factor is that we are showing up more local than we are a global brand. So we're working closely with key influencers in the regions. That's not something we've generally done this aggressively in the past before. We've got some great partnerships with local influencers and celebrities, and also Fashion Institute in China that is giving us access to local designers to collaborate with. And we're showing up more -- with more of a local understanding of the consumer versus purely just peanut butter spread a global campaign. So we're getting surgical on the regions, both in assortment and distribution, but also the consumers that we're going after and leveraging those local relationships as best we can, and that's driving a very healthy business right now. So it's good. Despite some of the challenges, obviously, at a macro level in both Europe and in China right now, our brands are still covered and are performing well. And like I said, it's great to see that turnaround, and we see it continuing. A little more challenging in UGG in the US, just some of the wholesale nuances with shipping and things that we've had last year versus this year. But overall, it's off to a really good start. And like I said, in this environment, it's tremendous to see the international region is doing so well.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nDave Powers: Yeah, okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Nikic from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess on the FX side, I mean, it sounds like you were it not for FX changes over the last three months, you would have been raising guidance today. Is there anything -- like do you make -- trying to make any pricing adjustments or anything like that given how dramatically the exchange rates have shifted and the relative values in the different markets has changed dramatically, or do you just take the changes in FX rates and what they've done to the prices and the margin rates of those businesses and just kind of run rate from there?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, Tom, this is Steve. Good question. I think you're correct. And we did say this is, yes, on a constant currency operational basis, we are increasing our outlook. That increase has been offset by a stronger US dollar. So that's why we're holding guidance. It is an offset to the increase that we're seeing in the business. In terms of price increases, as you know, we have introduced pricing increases on HOKA this year. We have some other price increases on selected styles in UGG that are starting in Q2. It's difficult in season to change pricing. And, therefore, there really isn't an opportunity once you're in season to adjust pricing. It is something that we can look at going forward, but it's not anything that will impact this year.\nTom Nikic: And I've got a quick follow-up. Just a quick follow-up on -- so UGG last year in Q4, I recall you said that you had a bunch of stuff that you had shipped for the wholesale channel, and the wholesale partners are planning to pack it away and release it for holiday 2022. Does that have a meaningful impact on the back half, or the shape of the back half? I mean, it causes a pretty difficult compare in the fiscal Q4. So I just want to touch on that.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah, it's a good question, Tom. So in terms of, and especially related to Q4, again, we're not giving out quarterly Q3, Q4 breakout. But to your point, in Q4, I think the thing to recall last year was as we were experiencing significant supply chain disruption, ship build up at the ports, congestion at the ports, we were not able to ship products as much as we would have liked in Q3. That -- a lot of that started to clear up in Q4. So we were shipping more product in Q4 last year than what we would normally do in a regular year. You would have seen some more of that in Q3. The other is, we saw a good demand on the DTC side in Q4, too. So that was another buildup in the quarter. So we're still building on that business. Again, it's overshadowed by the strength of the US dollars and the significant impact of foreign currency. So you don't necessarily see that level of growth, because on the international front, we do get hit with the currency. So we are comping a very strong back half last year, especially in Q4. And so, again, it's not changing necessarily the shape of the business for the back half. There is some quarterly cadence between the two quarters, but we're building on an exceptionally strong back half last year. This year, it just gets a little bit overshadowed by the strength of the US dollar and currency impact.\nTom Nikic: Thanks, very much. And best of luck in the holyday season.\nSteve Fasching: All right. Thanks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jon Komp from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJon Komp: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Steve, maybe just a follow-up on the gross margin assumptions for the second half. Can you maybe just talk about how your promotional assumptions changed for the second half, if at all, versus what you maybe previously thought embedded in the gross margin? And then, bigger picture, any change in your confidence that you should be a low 50s gross margin business over time?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I think, answering the last question first, it depends, right? It depends on everything that's going on. So the gross margin decline, again, on a full year guide, because that's what we provided, the 51.5 to 50.5. The large majority of that is currency driven. So when you do your model and you calculate what we just delivered in the first half and you calculate your second half, the large bulk of that decline is driven by the further strengthening of the US dollar. And just one other item to recall is Q3 and Q4 are big quarters for us, with Q3 being the biggest. So we are going to feel more of that currency impact in Q3, because we have more business, wholesale direct business on the international front. So that is -- there is a slight component of an increased promotion factored into that. But, again, a large majority of the change or reduction is driven by foreign currency.\nJon Komp: Got it. Understood. And then maybe, Dave, switching to HOKA. Could you share a little bit more on your reaction to what you've seen following the launch of the marketing campaign this summer? I know you mentioned a pretty impressive improvement in awareness. Just curious, how marketing has contributed to that. And as you think for HOKA, the balance of this year and into next year, what are you looking at in terms of what could be the most incremental for growth going forward here for HOKA?\nDave Powers: Yes. I would say, on the marketing, we're very happy with how the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign has been received globally. It's been very early received from all of our partners around the globe. It's resonating very well with the consumer. We shared some of the metrics in the prepared remarks. And those results are incredible. In L.A. and New York to have that kind of uplift on additional marketing spend. And we are shifting more money to top of funnel and experiencing with different mediums. And we're learning a lot, and it's paying off. So we're going to continue to do that. As you know, we've said for many years now, we're going to continue to invest in our brands through marketing and talent. And this is just a great indication of when we get a powerful unified global campaign for this brand and move some more money to the top of the funnel that has a very positive impact. And so that's a new learning for us. We're going to continue to lean into that and explore different ways of connecting with our consumer. I think for HOKA going forward, we have some exciting launches. We just lost -- we're launching the Clifton 9 coming up in Q4. That's going to be a major launch for us. And we're continuing to have a very healthy and exciting pipeline of product. But as we've talked about before, we're dominant in run and trail. We need to bolster our opportunities in hike. And we're getting tremendous response from some of our lifestyle distributions such as Free People in the US. And so it's extending the reach of our brand. It's bringing in a younger, more fashionable consumer. And really, it's hitting on all cylinders. So it's just a matter of where we want to focus our launches, where we want to focus our marketing spend and drive the upside surgically over the next six months. But there's a lot of opportunity here. We're just really optimized -- focused on optimizing margin and sell-through and creating awareness at a top level.\nJon Komp: Great. Thank you very much.\nDave Powers: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Dave, I want to follow-up on the HOKA question. I think in the opening remarks, you mentioned that your long-term vision is to build HOKA into a multibillion dollar brand. Maybe can you just elaborate on how your vision has evolved over the last three months? What you see is the potential for HOKA? And if you could put any numbers around that multibillion, do you mean $2 billion, $3 billion? Anything around that would be helpful. And then, Steve, just on the guidance for the year, I think you said down mid-single digits, but could you give us a constant currency guide for UGG for the full year? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yeah. Good question, Jay. I think obviously, for HOKA, the growth-on-growth that we're experiencing now, the scale of that business, the multiple categories that we're doing very well in and the expansion into more lifestyle product and distribution, all with still performance product, we're just finding more opportunities. The awareness we said in the script of the brand for non-runner is only around 20%. It's single digits in the international regions. And so when you start doing the math on awareness increases, the category opportunities head-to-toe, the global markets both in our omni-channel distribution, there's clearly a path to a multibillion dollar opportunity. And as I've said before, we don't see this as just a running brand. This is a running, trail, hike brand that is more like a North Face or a Salomon eventually than it is more like a Brook. So we are re-looking at our category approach, we are bolstering up some design and product management talent in our teams, we're elevating our marketing functions and we're going to stay aggressive, because we feel we have a tremendous opportunity to create the next multibillion dollar performance brand.\nSteve Fasching: And then, Jay, this is Steve. On an UGG constant currency guidance, it's more like very low single-digit decline.\nJay Sole: Got it, okay. And then can you just talk about October and the weather compares versus last year? How is October started? And last year was negatively impacted by weather in November, is that fair to say specifically in the US? And what's your expectation this year? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Go ahead, Dave.\nDave Powers: Yeah. I mean, so far, so good. I mean we spoke about some of the early launches of the Ultra Mini platform products, both in the Ultra and all of Tasman. I mean, we're seeing just incredible response to those products. And we've gotten great press from a lot of the runways in Europe and also in New York. Influencers, they're wearing our product in a compelling way. I think the advertising, the marketing campaign is resonating very well with our consumer. We're getting really good feedback on that, and the sell-through of these extended Classics is exceptional. So we're pleased. And again, we're heading in with a lot of confidence, but we're heading into an environment that is seemingly going to be very promotional. But we're going to try to optimize full price sell-through as best we can and come out clean and healthy.\nJay Sole: Sounds great. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Thanks for taking my question. So before I get to questions, Erinn, can you give us the -- my normal question, please, on what the wholesale revenue is by brand?\nSteve Fasching: Sure. Sam, that counts as one question.\nSam Poser: No, it doesn't because you should just put it on there. You just tell everybody upfront.\nErinn Kohler: Okay. So UGG wholesale, 361 for the quarter; HOKA wholesale, $223 million; Teva, $20 million; Sanuk, $5 million; other brands, call it, $28 million; and DTC is $239 million of the $875 million in total.\nSam Poser: Okay. Thank you. Okay, so now for questions. The FX, you're looking for what? What are the FX headwinds in total that you're looking for in the back half? I'll just ask all my questions together. What are your replenishment expectations for UGG built into your guidance for the third and fourth quarters? And I'll just do those two and I got one more.\nDave Powers: Yeah. So on the second half, as we said in the call script, there's $70 million of currency headwinds for the company in the back half of the year.\nSteve Fasching: Just back half.\nDave Powers: Yeah. And then in terms of replenishment\u2026\nSam Poser: On the gross margin, though, on the gross margin, what's the headwind on the growth like just for the back half? That's for the full year?\nSteve Fasching: Correct. $140 million on back half.\nDave Powers: Yeah. I'll just double check that real quick. Do you get the right info?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. So $110 million on the first half impact, and then $140 million on the full year impact, and then you can back into the second half impact.\nSam Poser: My math isn't good. But -- and then with UGG, what percent of the UGG business in the third and fourth quarter is international versus US? And how does that break down from a wholesale to DTC scenario? Because it looks like the DTC business, I would assume that's very US centric, and the demand just looks like it's exceptionally strong. So I mean, how are you thinking about wholesale and DTC from a -- you can do a currency neutral or whatever, just in for UGG for the balance of the year, especially DTC?\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. So second half wholesale, we're looking down a little bit. So again, all brands, global; and then DTC, we're looking up. So roughly speaking, kind of low single digits down on the wholesale second half and high single-digit-ish up on the DTC back half.\nSam Poser: But I would assume that would mean that UGG wholesale is down a lot, just given how strong it was last year and the FX, that's offset by high increases balance different with HOKA. Is that a fair way to think about it?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And again, part of that wholesale dynamic, to the earlier question, is because last year, we had a lot that went out in the second half. We had a lot that went out in Q4, specifically, especially as we were replenishing depleted wholesale inventories with incoming inventory that arrived in Q4.\nSam Poser: All right. Thank you very much. Continued success.\nSteve Fasching: All right. Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please, go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon. As you think about the progress in the channels of wholesale and DTC, you had mentioned on one of the last calls about expanded distribution. What are you seeing for UGG and for HOKA in terms of distribution and where you're looking to position? And then on the DTC side, when you talk about eliminating goods through your own channel, given its more productive, where are you seeing more of the strength coming from and how you're planning DTC, both in, whether it's outlet or full price going forward? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Good question, Dana. So in UGG, there really isn't extended distribution happening. So we're sticking to our tight distribution framework that we have globally. We've been working hard at establishing that, closing more accounts than opening. So we're not really in an expansion mode for distribution in UGG. We're trying to consolidate, work with the strategic players that we have tremendous relationships with an optimized DTC. For HOKA, it's a little bit different. We obviously want to optimize DTC, and we're doing a great job with that. But we are strategically expanding two doors, not in a massive scale, but I'll give you an example in the US. Coming up in Q3 this fall, we're going to expand up to 100 doors in DSG with DICK'S Sporting Goods. So we're slowly opening up more doors with that account and expanding a little bit. We're testing Foot Locker. And then, so -- but beyond that, there really isn't much distribution expansion for either of our brands. What we're seeing is higher rates of productivity and full price sell-through in the accounts we have. Those accounts are like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Foot Locker are new-ish and we're still learning a lot. But the growth that we're seeing in existing accounts and the productivity in those doors is very exciting, similar to what we're seeing in DTC. And then we're going to continue to strategically thoughtfully expand distribution, because we don't really need a lot more distribution right now, with the demand we're seeing in the channels we have, and we want to enter into any new distribution in a quality brand building way. From a DTC perspective, we use that strategically. One of the beauty of our omni model is that we can shift pretty easily between wholesale and e-commerce and retail. And we use the DTC channel strategically to exit some goods at a high healthy margin, but also use that as an acquisition for new customer retention. Inventory, we were so tight last year in inventory that we didn't have probably any excess. You'll see a little bit more on our UGG and HOKA websites perhaps than you've seen in the past, but that's strategic because we make more money in those sales on our own accounts and we get the consumer data versus discounting heavily in the marketplace. So we want to control this as much as we can, and strategically use DTC as an engine to drive growth and profit and also acquisition.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thank you. Hello, guys. Really nice work from an operational standpoint, I'm sure that hasn't been easy. So kudos to the team. My question, I wanted to focus on UGG product diversification. You highlighted some great progress. Can you speak specifically to UGG diversification traction in international markets? Is it lagging North America? Has the uptake of styles like the Tasman and the MINI been a US centric phenomenon, or is that also showing in international markets? Any perspective you could provide there would be great.\nSteve Fasching: Yeah. No, it's a great question. And it's interesting because we've had such success with more fashionable styles. The Fluff was a big acquisition opportunity for us with the younger consumers, and there's a lot more fashion and fund. But what you're seeing right now is the excitement around our Classics extension. So the team has done a tremendous job of taking our core Classics, which we, as you know, we've managed incredibly well over the last three years, pulling back on distribution, allocating inventory. And now we're going back to these accounts with a more expanded classic offering, which is right on trend. The platform trend is out there in a big way. That product is selling well globally, as well as the Tasman as is a little bit more behind on a new international level. But generally speaking, the diversification into heritage Classics and kind of more fashionable product is serving this brand incredibly well. We're bringing in more diverse consumers. We're bringing in younger consumers, people are purchasing more often. International is a little bit behind on, for example, China is having a moment now with Fluff, where US and Europe, that was last year. So it's just a little bit of a different cadence in some of the international markets versus the US, but all the product is resonating. The one difference in, I would say, the Asia Pacific region is that, they have a higher penetration of Classics overall, but they also have a much higher penetration of sneakers in those markets, which have been resonating very well also, which gives us more opportunity to lean into that category going forward, which is a big one for the UGG brand to capture. So strategy is working great. You're going to see an expanded focus on classics and more functional product coming into next year, which we believe will be accretive to margin and ASP and still some market share from others in that space as well. So lots of opportunity, we've got some work to do on bolstering men's at the moment and putting more marketing behind that category. But overall, the new product is resonating well and we're very optimistic.\nJim Duffy: Very helpful. Then just one more. Steve, you made some comments on difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter that seems more UGG-specific point of clarification. Is there a HOKA element to that as well that we should think about modeling those brands?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. There is a HOKA element. So I think the important thing to remember there was in both Q2 and Q3 last year, we were really starved for HOKA inventory. And that really arrived in Q4. So we had a kind of pent-up demand that was being fulfilled in Q4. And so you saw a big spike in HOKA Q4 of last year, and we're comping that this year. So yes, that \u2013 HOKA does play a part in Q4 as well as UGG.\nJim Duffy: Very good. Thank you, guys.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Jim.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss the strong results delivered by our portfolio of compelling brands as we make continued strides towards our long-term strategic vision even amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment. For the second quarter, revenue increased 21% versus prior year to $876 million. In the quarter, our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA drove compelling revenue growth of 6% and 58%, respectively. Steve will provide further details on the strength of our second quarter later in the call. But for now, I'd like to focus on how our first half results demonstrate Decker's progress towards longer term goals. As a reminder, our long-term vision is to build HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, further diversify the UGG brand's product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention and drive international markets through strategic investments, while maintaining top-tier levels of profitability for the company overall. With the continued focus on moving our in-demand products into the marketplace early ahead of the UGG brand's peak selling season, and while at the same time, fueling year-round demand for the HOKA brand, we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far against our annual outlook of the current fiscal year. As we continue to track our progress, I reflect on the first half results of fiscal 2023, which thus far have delivered consolidated revenue growth of 21% versus last year and 64% versus two years ago, HOKA revenue growth of 57% versus last year, with the brand now representing 44% of consolidated revenue, up from 35% last year and 28% two years ago; UGG revenue growth of 3% versus last year, with international driving growth aligned with our strategy despite currency headwinds and a 63% increase in DTC acquisition versus last year for HOKA, and a 54% increase for reflecting the strength of the demand of our brands, which propelled revenue growth of 26% for the first half. Results like this demonstrate the success of Deckers' multi-pronged approach to creating growth and proactively managing our brands to progress towards our long-term vision while delivering quality profitability. Deckers is able to deliver on our objectives while managing through external factors because of our flexible operating model, omnichannel capabilities and our nimble organization. Our compelling brands are well-positioned for the second half of the fiscal year, and I'm confident in the team's ability to continue executing. Steve will provide further details on our updated thoughts on guidance and the macroeconomic environment later in the call. But for now, let's dive into the brand and channel performance highlights for the second quarter and first half. Starting with UGG. As a reminder, Anne Spangenberg joined our company earlier this year to leave the Fashion Lifestyle group, which includes the UGG and Koolaburra brands. With her a wealth of experience, Anne is already having an impressive impact on UGG, as a leader with passion and a clear vision that puts the consumer at the center of everything the brand is doing, it aligned with the UGG brand strategy implemented over the last few years, Anne is focused on refining a few key elements of the brand's approach to product and demand creation, which include expanding the base of UGG consumers through a clear strategic vision of brand purpose and experience, prioritizing the design DNA of UGG in the product proposition, editing and focusing UGG products and experiences to maximize consumer impact and elevating the pinnacle expression of UGG. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Anne's vision integrated into the UGG brand's bright future ahead. Moving to UGG brands first half results. Global revenue in the second quarter increased 6% versus last year to $477 million. For the first half, UGG revenue increased 3% over the prior year. We've been talking for some time about the diversification of UGG product and the brand's focus on developing franchises to complement core Classics. The UGG product team has done a fantastic job, broadening the consumer appeal beyond Classics, while also ensuring Classics remain the pinnacle expression of UGG. Keeping Classics special essential to our UGG marketplace allocation and segmentation strategy that spans multiple countries and critical to UGG maintaining high levels of brand interest around the world. From a product standpoint, UGG has quite literally elevated core Classics through the introduction of fashion forward platform versions of the brand's most iconic styles, generating tremendous press coverage from being spotted on top models and going viral on TikTok. Platform Classics are already trending in the top 10 amongst new consumers in 18 to 34-year olds, and the fall season is just getting started. Additionally, with excitement building around the platforms, we've also seen a significant demand uptick in the original core Classics that inspired them, as DTC revenue from the Classics Ultra Mini and the Classic Mini in the first half increased more than 200% and more than 60% versus last year, respectively. Beyond Classics, UGG has continued to find success with hybrid styles, of which the latest and greatest example has been the Tasman. For the first half of this year, the Tasman has been a top five style for UGG overall and the number one style purchase at DDC. We've been encouraged to see the Tasman being adopted as a genderless style, a movement being led by the UGG brand's 18 to 34-year-old cohort as the second most popular and most popular style among female and male consumers in the age group, respectively. Further to the Tasman's popularity and the prevalence of platforms, UGG introduced a platform Tazz last year, and the style is already in the top 10 amongst 18 to 34-year olds. We're excited about the continued opportunity with this franchise as it speaks to the UGG brand's growing year on appeal and increased category diversification. Driving the success of an early attention to UGG this fall, with the brand team's enhanced global marketing campaign strategy that leans into the consumer feedback derived from a recent brand survey. With concrete consumer feedback across the eight global markets provided by the surveys, UGG designed this year's campaign dubbed Feels Like UGG, to deliver a unified brand message via local influencers that were cast specifically for each of these individual key markets, which leans into the feeling and comfort that are core to the brand's DNA. Beginning with an influencer event in Paris that coincided with the UGG collaboration with opening ceremony and continuing on to a collaboration with 6pm that was featured during Fashion Week Milan, the Feels Like UGG campaign was launched on the runway and broadcast globally through social engagement by a community of ambassadors and consumers who love the brand. We are seeing tremendous response from consumers thus far, as in the second quarter, search interest for the US increased 11% versus last year, with two-thirds of the ugg.com visitors new to the site, 18 to 34-year old site visitors in EMEA more than doubled versus last year, Asia Pacific DTC business grew 11% versus last year, and global DTC retention increased 50% versus the prior year. The consumer response has been positive globally for the UGG brand. First half revenue was driven by international regions as the US lap significant wholesale refill activity from the prior year. Additionally, some of this year-to-date growth overseas is due to lapping supply chain latency in the first half of last year, but we feel the UGG brand's international regions returning to growth is proof of the successful marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the last few years. All-in-all, the UGG brand is positioned well for holiday with inventory availability having improved relative to last year in key markets across the globe. We're encouraged by the results we've seen early in the season, but as always, remain cautious with our busiest period still to come. Shifting to HOKA, global revenue for the second quarter increased 58% versus last year for $333 million, a quarterly revenue record for HOKA, leading to a first half revenue increase of 57% versus last year. HOKA growth continues to be driven by the brand's exceptional global ecosystem of access points, which is building market share through increased awareness and benefiting from strategic door count increases. While greater market share with existing accounts is responsible for the majority of HOKA growth this year, the brand has made some notable addition to access points, which include expanded distribution with strategic growth accounts, 12 owned and operated stores to build awareness and serve the monobrand China market, two stores in Japan and five pop-up stores in the US. Each of these access points are designed to build HOKA brand awareness and increase consumer access to new geographic locations. In addition, the HOKA brand has rolled out exciting out-of-home FLY HUMAN FLY campaign content in highly visible cities around the world, helping to drive a 145% increase in search terms in New York and Los Angeles. With these efforts, we've seen the HOKA brand's DTC growth rate accelerate from the first quarter into the second. Overall, for the first half, HOKA has driven exceptional increases in DTC retention and acquisition, increasing 70% and 63%, respectively, across global markets. All of these actions are driving incredible increases in brand awareness. Over the last two years, HOKA awareness across all consumers has improved nine percentage points and even crossed the 20% threshold, with awareness among runners even higher according to Decker's proprietary brands tracker study. Outside of the US, awareness is much lower, with most regions sitting in the low teens percentage, but seeing similarly explosive growth and awareness, which highlights the significant opportunity for continued HOKA brand expansion, augmenting the global marketing campaign. HOKA global event sponsorships have continued to help the brand maintain and build performance credibility with extreme athletes around the world. One recent example of this is the HOKA brand sponsorship of the Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc, the UTMB World Series. In the brand's first year sponsoring the UTMB Series, we saw positive results, as HOKA achieved a 34% share of shoes tracked on race participants, which is well-above last year's total. Additionally, HOKA athlete Ludovic Pommeret placed first in 145-kilometer TDS race in this year's UTMB series wearing the HOKA spigot trail shoe to conquer the course's diverse terrain. The HOKA brands alignment with the ultra competitive UTMB series highlights the brand's focus on becoming a leader in the growing outdoor trail and hiking segment. The aforementioned Speedgoat is the HOKA brand's top trail shoe. Coinciding with the UTMB event, in order to complement the Speedgoat, HOKA launched the Mafate Speed 4, which is an innovative update to a heritage style designed to broaden the brand's footprint in trail. Early reads from consumers purchasing the Mafate have been exceptionally strong across global markets, which is exciting for HOKA as the brand focuses on building market share in the trail category. For hiking, HOKA now has two franchises in Kaha and the Anacapa that are experiencing immense growth and building market share. Thus far, in fiscal year 2023, both of these hiking franchises have made their way into the top 10 most purchased styles for HOKA. We believe this is because of the unique HOKA DNA that sets these franchises apart with their lightweight platform and maximum cushion that compares favorably to bulkier products from the competition. Importantly, while we're seeing really strong growth in new categories of focus such as trail and hiking, HOKA is also delivering exceptional growth and results with core running styles like the Bondi. With the support of the increased global brand awareness I mentioned earlier, the brand's launch of the eighth evolution of the flagship Bondi franchise was even more impactful as the Bondi 8 was the top-selling style globally in the second quarter, more than doubled last year's Bondi 7 volume among 18 to 34-year-old consumers. It was a top five DTC style across Decker's entire portfolio of brands for the first half despite just launching in August. With this latest addition, Bondi, the brand's most plush riot got softer and more comfortable. With the lightest HOKA foam to date in an all-new extended shell geometry, featuring rear crash pads that provide a soft and balanced transition built for long distance. In just a few months of selling, the Bondi 8 has already been named the Best Road Running Shoe by both the SELF Certified Sneaker Awards as well as the GQ Fitness Awards. Congratulations to the HOKA team for the continued success and balanced growth across global regions and product categories. We look forward to delivering more exciting and innovative products throughout the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. From a channel performance perspective, the first half was strong in both wholesale and DTC, fueled by a 39% increase in consumer acquisition and 44% increase in retention. First half global direct-to-consumer revenue grew 26% versus last year. HOKA continues to be a significant driver of consolidated DTC growth, and the brand's growth rate even accelerated from the first quarter into the second, overall increasing 66% versus the prior year for the first half. UGG also contributed to the first half DTC growth, as the brand returned to growth in Q2, leading to a 4% increase for the brand in the first half. On wholesale, global revenue in the first half increased 20% versus last year. Strength in the wholesale channel was primarily driven by HOKA gaining global market share and the brand benefiting from select additional doors with strategic accounts. UGG also contributed to first half wholesale growth in the brand's international regions. Our first half performance highlights the strength of our omni-channel marketplace management strategies that have allowed our brands to build market share with strategic retailers, while capturing DTC demand at the same time. And while we continue to see great demand in the marketplace for our brands, as we move into the back half, the environment is evolving quickly, which may present challenges outside of our control. However, our teams are focused on the variables that are within our control as we work towards this year's objectives. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will walk you through further details on second quarter performance, as well as the context of our reaffirmed full year top and bottom line guidance. Thanks, Steve. We are excited about the strong results delivered in the first half of fiscal year 2023. But again, it's important to acknowledge that we are still operating within an uncertain environment where things can change quickly, and the bulk of our fiscal year is still ahead. With that said, Deckers is fortunate to have two of the strongest brands in the footwear space that continue to engage and attract new consumers every day. The UGG brand's diverse product assortment is positioned well for holiday, led by elevated platform Classics, which are driving heat and excitement around the core, as well as the continued interest in more transitional hybrid styles like the Tasman and Ultra Mini. Paired with a compelling marketing campaign that is resonating across global markets, we expect UGG to perform well this holiday season. Our powerful brands paired with strategic marketplace management, omni-channel capabilities and disciplined financial management gives me the confidence that our organization can achieve a compelling guidance set forth for fiscal year 2023, even in the face of macro pressures that will impact the broader retail space. Of course, none of this will be possible without the dedication and hard work of our employees, who I'd like to thank in advance of our busiest period of the year. I'd also encourage everyone listening to take a look at our FY 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report that we'll be launching next week and will be posted on deckers.com, further highlighting our company's efforts to do good and do great in the communities where we operate and beyond. Thanks, everybody, for joining us here today, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to continue sharing the exciting future ahead at Deckers. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? And I would just add on to that. We've been spending a lot of time planning the back half of the year. And we're really proud of the fact that we're able to maintain guidance despite some really significant headwinds on the margin front potentially, from a proportional standpoint, but significant FX headwinds as well. And we've aligned as a leadership team across the organization, and we feel confident that we can still deliver, despite some of these significant headwinds, and that's our objective. And we're going to optimize the strength of our brands right now to deliver its healthy margin and promotional-free season that we can. Yes, sure. We're really pleased with how things are playing out internationally. We've been working at transitioning those markets much like we did in the US a few years ago and we're starting to see fruits of that work in a positive way, particularly around diversified Classics in the UGG brand and younger consumers. And so, the marketing campaign, the key styles, the platform styles are really resonating well in those regions. But I think a key factor is that we are showing up more local than we are a global brand. So we're working closely with key influencers in the regions. That's not something we've generally done this aggressively in the past before. We've got some great partnerships with local influencers and celebrities, and also Fashion Institute in China that is giving us access to local designers to collaborate with. And we're showing up more -- with more of a local understanding of the consumer versus purely just peanut butter spread a global campaign. So we're getting surgical on the regions, both in assortment and distribution, but also the consumers that we're going after and leveraging those local relationships as best we can, and that's driving a very healthy business right now. So it's good. Despite some of the challenges, obviously, at a macro level in both Europe and in China right now, our brands are still covered and are performing well. And like I said, it's great to see that turnaround, and we see it continuing. A little more challenging in UGG in the US, just some of the wholesale nuances with shipping and things that we've had last year versus this year. But overall, it's off to a really good start. And like I said, in this environment, it's tremendous to see the international region is doing so well. Yeah, okay. Thanks, Tom. Yes. I would say, on the marketing, we're very happy with how the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign has been received globally. It's been very early received from all of our partners around the globe. It's resonating very well with the consumer. We shared some of the metrics in the prepared remarks. And those results are incredible. In L.A. and New York to have that kind of uplift on additional marketing spend. And we are shifting more money to top of funnel and experiencing with different mediums. And we're learning a lot, and it's paying off. So we're going to continue to do that. As you know, we've said for many years now, we're going to continue to invest in our brands through marketing and talent. And this is just a great indication of when we get a powerful unified global campaign for this brand and move some more money to the top of the funnel that has a very positive impact. And so that's a new learning for us. We're going to continue to lean into that and explore different ways of connecting with our consumer. I think for HOKA going forward, we have some exciting launches. We just lost -- we're launching the Clifton 9 coming up in Q4. That's going to be a major launch for us. And we're continuing to have a very healthy and exciting pipeline of product. But as we've talked about before, we're dominant in run and trail. We need to bolster our opportunities in hike. And we're getting tremendous response from some of our lifestyle distributions such as Free People in the US. And so it's extending the reach of our brand. It's bringing in a younger, more fashionable consumer. And really, it's hitting on all cylinders. So it's just a matter of where we want to focus our launches, where we want to focus our marketing spend and drive the upside surgically over the next six months. But there's a lot of opportunity here. We're just really optimized -- focused on optimizing margin and sell-through and creating awareness at a top level. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Good question, Jay. I think obviously, for HOKA, the growth-on-growth that we're experiencing now, the scale of that business, the multiple categories that we're doing very well in and the expansion into more lifestyle product and distribution, all with still performance product, we're just finding more opportunities. The awareness we said in the script of the brand for non-runner is only around 20%. It's single digits in the international regions. And so when you start doing the math on awareness increases, the category opportunities head-to-toe, the global markets both in our omni-channel distribution, there's clearly a path to a multibillion dollar opportunity. And as I've said before, we don't see this as just a running brand. This is a running, trail, hike brand that is more like a North Face or a Salomon eventually than it is more like a Brook. So we are re-looking at our category approach, we are bolstering up some design and product management talent in our teams, we're elevating our marketing functions and we're going to stay aggressive, because we feel we have a tremendous opportunity to create the next multibillion dollar performance brand. Yeah. I mean, so far, so good. I mean we spoke about some of the early launches of the Ultra Mini platform products, both in the Ultra and all of Tasman. I mean, we're seeing just incredible response to those products. And we've gotten great press from a lot of the runways in Europe and also in New York. Influencers, they're wearing our product in a compelling way. I think the advertising, the marketing campaign is resonating very well with our consumer. We're getting really good feedback on that, and the sell-through of these extended Classics is exceptional. So we're pleased. And again, we're heading in with a lot of confidence, but we're heading into an environment that is seemingly going to be very promotional. But we're going to try to optimize full price sell-through as best we can and come out clean and healthy. Thank you. Yeah. So on the second half, as we said in the call script, there's $70 million of currency headwinds for the company in the back half of the year. Yeah. And then in terms of replenishment... Yeah. I'll just double check that real quick. Do you get the right info? Yes. Good question, Dana. So in UGG, there really isn't extended distribution happening. So we're sticking to our tight distribution framework that we have globally. We've been working hard at establishing that, closing more accounts than opening. So we're not really in an expansion mode for distribution in UGG. We're trying to consolidate, work with the strategic players that we have tremendous relationships with an optimized DTC. For HOKA, it's a little bit different. We obviously want to optimize DTC, and we're doing a great job with that. But we are strategically expanding two doors, not in a massive scale, but I'll give you an example in the US. Coming up in Q3 this fall, we're going to expand up to 100 doors in DSG with DICK'S Sporting Goods. So we're slowly opening up more doors with that account and expanding a little bit. We're testing Foot Locker. And then, so -- but beyond that, there really isn't much distribution expansion for either of our brands. What we're seeing is higher rates of productivity and full price sell-through in the accounts we have. Those accounts are like DICK'S Sporting Goods and Foot Locker are new-ish and we're still learning a lot. But the growth that we're seeing in existing accounts and the productivity in those doors is very exciting, similar to what we're seeing in DTC. And then we're going to continue to strategically thoughtfully expand distribution, because we don't really need a lot more distribution right now, with the demand we're seeing in the channels we have, and we want to enter into any new distribution in a quality brand building way. From a DTC perspective, we use that strategically. One of the beauty of our omni model is that we can shift pretty easily between wholesale and e-commerce and retail. And we use the DTC channel strategically to exit some goods at a high healthy margin, but also use that as an acquisition for new customer retention. Inventory, we were so tight last year in inventory that we didn't have probably any excess. You'll see a little bit more on our UGG and HOKA websites perhaps than you've seen in the past, but that's strategic because we make more money in those sales on our own accounts and we get the consumer data versus discounting heavily in the marketplace. So we want to control this as much as we can, and strategically use DTC as an engine to drive growth and profit and also acquisition."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the second quarter to finish the first half of fiscal year 2023 in a position of strength. HOKA drove another quarter of exceptional growth, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally. While there is plenty of heavy lifting ahead and we are now operating in our historically largest and most complex fiscal quarter, I'm confident in our team's demonstrated ability to execute on our plans even as macroeconomic challenges persist, most notably the continued strengthening of the US dollar. We will lean on our omni-channel capabilities, flexible operating model and strong balance sheet to remain nimble in navigating any dynamic marketplace shifts that may occur as we provide our brands the opportunity to continue building long-term sustainable market share. Now let's get into the details of the second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $876 million, representing an increase of 21% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 25% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the expansion of HOKA, which increased 58% versus last year, delivering record quarterly revenue of $333 million, and a 20% reported increase in UGG international regions as the brand benefited from marketplace reset initiatives implemented over the past couple of years, as well as lapping disrupted wholesale shipments in the prior year. Gross margin for the second quarter was 48.2%, which is down 270 basis points from last year's 50.9%. Roughly half of the decline in gross margin was driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, with additional impacts from higher promotional activity for UGG as compared to last year's exceptionally low levels with the brand primarily utilizing higher margin DTC closet events to move through excess spring season inventory; higher ocean freight rates, which was partially offset by benefits from a reduction in airfreight usage, HOKA price increases and favorable brand mix with HOKA driving the majority of growth. SG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $294 million, up 23% versus last year's $239 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 50 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to higher advertising spend as a percentage of revenue. Our tax rate was 21.2%, which compares to 20.1% for the prior year. These results culminated in a diluted earnings per share of $3.80 for the quarter, which is $0.14 above last year's $3.66 diluted earnings per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2022, we ended September with $419 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $925 million, up 45% versus the same point in time last year, primarily from HOKA brand as we bring product in to continue momentum with the brand. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million worth of shares at an average price of $290. As of September 30, 2022, the company had approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2023. We are reaffirming prior consolidated revenue, operating margin and diluted earnings per share guidance. Our full fiscal year 2023 guidance now includes reaffirmed reported revenue growth of 10% to 11%, anticipating between $3.45 billion and $3.5 billion. With HOKA now expected to increase up to 50% versus last year, helping to offset larger currency headwinds as a result of a continued strengthening of the US dollar. And UGG is expected to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis, primarily due to negative currency impacts. Gross margin now expected to be approximately 50.5%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance, primarily due to increased currency impacts, as well as some additional promotional activity. SG&A as a percentage of sales now expected to be approximately 33%, reflecting variable savings to help offset further gross margin pressure that we have now incorporated. Operating margin range is still expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. Tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% and diluted earnings per share is reaffirmed in the range of $17.50 to $18.35. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, further impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruption, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changing consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the US dollar and geopolitical tensions. Now, for some additional context on the state of our business as we approach the busiest part of our year. From a logistics standpoint, we are still experiencing delays and the timing of container arrivals remains difficult to predict. But we feel good about the improvement in transit times, which has led to a reduction of inventory in transit on both a dollar and percentage basis as compared to last year. Additionally, I am pleased to report that container costs have come down, but would caution that we won't start to see that improvement in our gross margin for a few quarters. With that said, the headwinds we have experienced from ocean freight in the first half are expected to turn neutral for the remainder of this fiscal year. With the improvement we've seen on transit times and our strategic prioritization to bring inventory in earlier and hold higher levels in the country of sale, we no longer expect to use a material level of air freight in this fiscal year. Additionally, with the strength of our brands and ability to move through some promotional inventory during the quarter, we have seen our year-over-year inventory growth rate moderate as compared to recent quarters, with inventory levels 45% higher as of September 30th, compared to the same date last year, at which point, inventory levels were below normal operating levels. While we are still chasing the exceptional demand for our brands, particularly with the opportunity we've outlined for HOKA, we are likely to see inventory growth outpace sales in part to hedge against future disruption. On the promotional environment, given how clean we have been over the last few years, with very little promotion across our portfolio of brands, we have experienced increased levels of promotion so far this year related to clearing some excess inventory, largely UGG spring season product and shifts in the macroeconomic environment. Embedded in our updated guidance for the full year, we expect more promotional activity relative to the exceptionally low level of promotion in prior years. Further on gross margin, I'd like to touch on currency as this has increasingly been a topic of interest. For the first half, we have seen a currency revenue impact to the tune of approximately $30 million and a 110 basis point impact to gross margin. With our business being second half weighted and no signs of a weakening dollar, we are anticipating a second half revenue impact of approximately $70 million, primarily impacting the UGG brand. In total, we now expect currency to negatively impact our gross margin rate by approximately 140 basis points for the full fiscal year 2023. This increased currency headwind is the primary driver of our change in our updated gross margin outlook. As our top and bottom line guidance has been maintained, despite the continued strengthening of the US dollar being incorporated, we are reflecting an underlying operational raise from our variable levers to remain on track with our original full year outlook. Excluding the negative impact of currency now projected in fiscal 2023, our guidance would indicate gross and operating margin expansion in comparison to the prior fiscal year. This currency neutral margin expansion would be driven by reduced airfreight usage, competitive marketplace price increases and brand mix benefits with the growth of HOKA being partially offset by first half ocean freight pressures, as well as increased promotional activity. Though clearly, there is much to overcome for the balance of our fiscal year, I am confident in the strength of our brands and ability to leverage our flexible operating model to deliver the compelling guidance we set out at the outset of this fiscal year. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yeah. Sure, Laurent. So just to give a little bit of perspective on the back half and you're right, we don't give quarterly guidance. So I think how we're seeing the year play out, and I know everybody's models are a little bit different, but it is, I think, laying out to the way we expected, which is much more growth in the first half. So I think, remember the context of last year, our first half was very disruptive in terms of inventory and product availability. And so when you see the big percentage increases in the first half of this year, we are, as we intended to do shipping out more product earlier in the year. That's benefiting clearly HOKA. You can see from the growth numbers, as well as UGG. Last year, as we started to see more inventory coming in, in the second half of the year, it was setting up a bigger half last year. So we are now comping against that bigger half that you saw last year. So that's why you see, from a percentage basis, the second half with lower percentage growth, because we're comparing to get that bigger second half quarter. We're still seeing significant growth with HOKA clearly in our guidance. Again, not quite to the same level of percentage increase. But, remember, we had a very big fourth quarter last year. And that was not only applicable to HOKA, but UGG as well. So, again, we're not breaking out quarters, but as I said, the year is playing out much to our expectation. Embedded in our updated guidance is an operational improvement, and that's largely coming from increases related to HOKA. So we're continuing to see strength. I mentioned it in my updated guidance in terms of now seeing growth for the full year of HOKA up to 50%, so before it was kind of 40%, 45%. So you're seeing that. I think the other thing, remember, is last year was more growth with wholesale, as we were replenishing the channel last year. So we're comping against a replenished year last year in the wholesale business. So you're going to see a slightly lower percentage growth on the wholesale business. But overall, trending very strong, demand signals very strong. The year is playing out well, seeing a strong start to Q3. So, again, as we've said before, and again, this is part of the reason we don't give or did not give quarterly guidance this year is because of the disruptive nature of last year. And we knew that there would be movements between quarters and we knew that first half was going to be much bigger growth this year, with percentage increases, lower but still strong dollar growth in the second half. Yeah, Tom, this is Steve. Good question. I think you're correct. And we did say this is, yes, on a constant currency operational basis, we are increasing our outlook. That increase has been offset by a stronger US dollar. So that's why we're holding guidance. It is an offset to the increase that we're seeing in the business. In terms of price increases, as you know, we have introduced pricing increases on HOKA this year. We have some other price increases on selected styles in UGG that are starting in Q2. It's difficult in season to change pricing. And, therefore, there really isn't an opportunity once you're in season to adjust pricing. It is something that we can look at going forward, but it's not anything that will impact this year. Yeah, it's a good question, Tom. So in terms of, and especially related to Q4, again, we're not giving out quarterly Q3, Q4 breakout. But to your point, in Q4, I think the thing to recall last year was as we were experiencing significant supply chain disruption, ship build up at the ports, congestion at the ports, we were not able to ship products as much as we would have liked in Q3. That -- a lot of that started to clear up in Q4. So we were shipping more product in Q4 last year than what we would normally do in a regular year. You would have seen some more of that in Q3. The other is, we saw a good demand on the DTC side in Q4, too. So that was another buildup in the quarter. So we're still building on that business. Again, it's overshadowed by the strength of the US dollars and the significant impact of foreign currency. So you don't necessarily see that level of growth, because on the international front, we do get hit with the currency. So we are comping a very strong back half last year, especially in Q4. And so, again, it's not changing necessarily the shape of the business for the back half. There is some quarterly cadence between the two quarters, but we're building on an exceptionally strong back half last year. This year, it just gets a little bit overshadowed by the strength of the US dollar and currency impact. All right. Thanks. Yes. I think, answering the last question first, it depends, right? It depends on everything that's going on. So the gross margin decline, again, on a full year guide, because that's what we provided, the 51.5 to 50.5. The large majority of that is currency driven. So when you do your model and you calculate what we just delivered in the first half and you calculate your second half, the large bulk of that decline is driven by the further strengthening of the US dollar. And just one other item to recall is Q3 and Q4 are big quarters for us, with Q3 being the biggest. So we are going to feel more of that currency impact in Q3, because we have more business, wholesale direct business on the international front. So that is -- there is a slight component of an increased promotion factored into that. But, again, a large majority of the change or reduction is driven by foreign currency. And then, Jay, this is Steve. On an UGG constant currency guidance, it's more like very low single-digit decline. Yes. Go ahead, Dave. Sure. Sam, that counts as one question. Just back half. Correct. $140 million on back half. Yeah. So $110 million on the first half impact, and then $140 million on the full year impact, and then you can back into the second half impact. Yeah. So second half wholesale, we're looking down a little bit. So again, all brands, global; and then DTC, we're looking up. So roughly speaking, kind of low single digits down on the wholesale second half and high single-digit-ish up on the DTC back half. Yes. And again, part of that wholesale dynamic, to the earlier question, is because last year, we had a lot that went out in the second half. We had a lot that went out in Q4, specifically, especially as we were replenishing depleted wholesale inventories with incoming inventory that arrived in Q4. All right. Thanks, Sam. Yeah. No, it's a great question. And it's interesting because we've had such success with more fashionable styles. The Fluff was a big acquisition opportunity for us with the younger consumers, and there's a lot more fashion and fund. But what you're seeing right now is the excitement around our Classics extension. So the team has done a tremendous job of taking our core Classics, which we, as you know, we've managed incredibly well over the last three years, pulling back on distribution, allocating inventory. And now we're going back to these accounts with a more expanded classic offering, which is right on trend. The platform trend is out there in a big way. That product is selling well globally, as well as the Tasman as is a little bit more behind on a new international level. But generally speaking, the diversification into heritage Classics and kind of more fashionable product is serving this brand incredibly well. We're bringing in more diverse consumers. We're bringing in younger consumers, people are purchasing more often. International is a little bit behind on, for example, China is having a moment now with Fluff, where US and Europe, that was last year. So it's just a little bit of a different cadence in some of the international markets versus the US, but all the product is resonating. The one difference in, I would say, the Asia Pacific region is that, they have a higher penetration of Classics overall, but they also have a much higher penetration of sneakers in those markets, which have been resonating very well also, which gives us more opportunity to lean into that category going forward, which is a big one for the UGG brand to capture. So strategy is working great. You're going to see an expanded focus on classics and more functional product coming into next year, which we believe will be accretive to margin and ASP and still some market share from others in that space as well. So lots of opportunity, we've got some work to do on bolstering men's at the moment and putting more marketing behind that category. But overall, the new product is resonating well and we're very optimistic. Yes. There is a HOKA element. So I think the important thing to remember there was in both Q2 and Q3 last year, we were really starved for HOKA inventory. And that really arrived in Q4. So we had a kind of pent-up demand that was being fulfilled in Q4. And so you saw a big spike in HOKA Q4 of last year, and we're comping that this year. So yes, that \u2013 HOKA does play a part in Q4 as well as UGG. Thanks, Jim."

I\u2019m excited to dive into another quarter of exceptional results, which represent a strong start to fiscal year 2023 and further progress towards our long-term strategies. First quarter revenue increased 22% versus last year to $614 million, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.66. Revenue growth was primarily driven by HOKA as the brand achieved its first ever $300 million quarter. With strong HOKA growth, we were able to deliver another profitable first quarter as we continue to reduce the historical seasonality of our portfolio through the expansion of year round HOKA demand and further diversifying the category mix. Importantly, our first quarter result demonstrated momentum behind our long-term vision to build HOKA into a multibillion dollar major player in the performance athletic space further diversify the UGG brands product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention, and drive international markets through strategic investments. We are making clear progress in each of these initiatives. During the first quarter, HOKA delivered global revenue of $330 million, an increase of 55% versus last year. UGG products mix shifted into sandals away from seasonal fall styles. UGG regional mix shifted towards international regions, as these markets drove year-over-year revenue growth. Global DTC across all brands grew 15% as a result of increasing consumer acquisition and retention by 13% and 28%, respectively, and revenue from international markets increased 36% versus last year, which includes earlier distributor shipments. These highlights reflect the strength of Deckers marketplace management and omni-channel capabilities across our portfolio of exciting brands. Our disciplined approach to managing brands, markets and distribution channels continues to serve us well, as we create the future of Deckers. While the macroeconomic environment is evolving quickly, I\u2019m confident in a consumer demand of our brands and our team\u2019s ability to remain nimble and deliver on our goals in this dynamic environment. Steve will provide further details around our forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let\u2019s dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Starting with the brand highlights, global HOKA revenue for the first quarter increased 55% versus last year to $330 million. This is a significant achievement that resulted in HOKA global revenue and the trailing 12 months, and in June 30, breaking the billion dollar barrier with much more growth ahead. The HOKA brands exceptional growth also delivered a new milestone for Deckers as a whole with HOKA revenue representing more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue for the first time. With its year on-demand that utilizes infrastructure during off peak UGG periods and full price selling at premium price points. The HOKA brands growing scale is improving Deckers overall quarterly financial and operational performance. The HOKA brands strong quarter featured outstanding revenue growth across the brands far reaching global ecosystem of access points highlighted by international markets increasing 66% versus last year, led by the strength of the EMEA region, which was partially influenced by the timing of selling for our distributors as we strategically build new markets. U.S. increasing 49% versus last year, with DTC growth leading wholesale global DTC increasing 58% versus last year, driven by continued momentum with retained consumers, as well as the continued acquisition of new consumers and global wholesale increasing 53% versus last year, as the brand increased market share and existing accounts and benefited from select doors added to strategic accounts. We were excited by the positive brand indicators and continued share gains that HOKA is building upon across its entire global distribution network. A few highlights include increasing market share within U.S. run specialty, while commanding higher retail prices. Focus styles accounting for at least half of the top 10 styles according to aggregated U.S. run specialty store data. Doubling revenue in France led by gains in Paris, which was our third fastest growing European city during the quarter, and APAC driving the highest regional GDP growth rate led by strengthen both China and Japan as these countries benefited from stores eating awareness with consumers. Across the globe HOKA stores have continued to build excitement with a new audience and drive compelling levels of traffic and purchase activity. This is especially exciting in China, which has been a slow build as HOKA took some time to find its voice with consumers local to the region. With a refined visual merchandising strategy enhancing the consumer experience, our China\u2019s stores are now driving higher conversion rates and we\u2019re better equipped as we open additional locations in the region. In the U.S., the retail team continues to work towards opening the HOKA brands first permanent location in New York City during the spring of calendar year 2023. This is an exciting endeavor as the HOKA store will feature an elevated design that is fit for our premier performance brand. In the meantime, HOKA is opening a second New York City pop-up location near Lincoln Center within the next month. Our Chicago location which was opened in the last 3 months is seeing excellent traffic and driving strong conversion, giving us even greater confidence in a consumer appetite for HOKA retail stores. We will take a disciplined approach to opening a limited number of doors. But we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to engage with consumers in key cities around the world. Further on direct-to-consumer across global markets, HOKA continues to increase the number of acquired and retained consumers that remarkable levels compared to the prior year. During the quarter, DTC acquisition increased 48% and retention increased 58% versus last year, with gains among 18 to 34 year old consumers far outpacing these increases. This led to a 4 percentage point increase in the mix of 18 to 34 year old, among individuals purchasing from hoka.com. We are seeing incredible momentum behind HOKA as the brand continues to inspire humans to fly over the earth. The HOKA brand ethos is echoed through its new globally integrated marketing campaign dubbed Fly Human Fly. This campaign was thoughtfully designed as an invitation for humans around the world to experience the HOKA arrived. As part of the campaign, HOKA launched the fifth edition of the Mach, which has quickly become a top 5 style for the brand, as well as a completely redesigned consumer website. The upgraded website features a brand new aesthetic that elevates product presentation with greater technical detail and enhances the visibility of brand values and storytelling throughout the site. Fly human fly has been live for just over a month now. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with the consumer response and feedback for our wholesale partners. But the fly human fly landing page at hoka.com, 83% of visitors were new, which aligns with the campaign\u2019s intent to reach a new audience. We believe this campaign will have a significant impact on building awareness of HOKA as we expand the brand into a multibillion dollar major player in the performance space over the long-term. Speaking of performance, I\u2019d like to congratulate HOKA sponsored athlete, Adam Peterman, for winning the 100 mile 2022 Western states race. This was an incredible feat for Adam having this been his first time ever competing in 100 mile race. He won while wearing recently launched HOKA Speedgoat 5, which is a completely redesigned version of the brand\u2019s most popular trail shoe with less weight and enhanced traction with Vibram Megagrip to inspire confidence in any terrain. Results like these emphasize that HOKA brands leadership is a premier performance brand, enabling athletes to achieve peak levels of performance. Other congratulations to Adam and all the other athletes who competed in this year\u2019s HOKA sponsored Western states 100. Moving to UGG, global revenue in the quarter decreased 2% versus last year to $208 million dollars. Outperformance was driven by higher international wholesale and distributor selling that was offset by category shift dynamics, impacting the brands global direct-to-consumer business. The UGG brands international regions continue to experience benefits from the marketplace allocation and segmentation strategies implemented to build brand heat and increased demand overseas. With core fall product limited in the marketplace that was able to drive full price sell through during the past holiday season, and generate open buy opportunities in the spring season, driving the quarter\u2019s results. UGG captured incremental market share with transition styles such as the Ultra Mini and Coquette as well as the newly launched Sport Yeah sandal, all of which are driving sell through. Briefly touching on the category dynamics impacting UGG global DTC. Over the last couple of years, the Fluff franchise experienced increased relevance as consumers turn to UGG for comfortable and stylish hybrid slippers to wear in the home. Expecting shifts in consumer behavior towards outdoor wearing, the UGG product team continued to evolve the franchise with the introduction of more spring, summer and outdoor ready styles, which included the Sport Yes Sandal. Sandals were the standout category for UGG during the quarter showing the strong demand for the brand outside of the fall and winter timeframe. While successful in shifting consumer adoption from heritage fluff franchise styles into beach ready styles. The lower average selling price in the sandal category created a revenue headwind relative to the exceptional volumes of Fluff that were sold during Q1 in the last 2 years. That said, the Fluff Yeah continues to be as top style among acquire and retain consumers, including with 18 to 34 year old. Across a global direct-to-consumer even though revenue dollars are below last year due to these product mix shifts, demand for UGG remain robust as the brand experienced increases of 8% and 13% and acquired and retain consumers respectively versus the prior year. Importantly, international DTC acquisition and retention gains are trending well ahead of these global figures as we continue to build brand heat overseas. He styles driving new consumer acquisition globally include the aforementioned Fluff Yeah and Sport Yeah, as well as the Clem in golden star fashion sandals, and the Tasman franchise which continues to be on fire. We are encouraged by the continued consumer interest and broader adoption of the UGG brands diverse product assortment. Overall, the first quarter represented a solid start to the year for UGG. We believe UGG is well positioned to drive a successful fiscal year 2023. And I\u2019m even more excited for the brand\u2019s future, after our recent announcement of Anne Spangenberg as the President of Fashion Lifestyle. Anne as a proven leader with meaningful experience building brands across our industry, most recently serving as Nike\u2019s Chief Merchant, and has already hit the ground running in the last few weeks as she begins to immerse herself with all things UGG, and engage with our talented brand team and cross functional business partners. In her new role, and we\u2019ll be building upon the strategic priorities for UGG, focusing on product diversification, consumer adoption and franchise evolution across our omni-channel marketplace. I\u2019d like to welcome, Anne, and thank the UGG team for the cross functional collaboration and teamwork that enabled the brand to maintain a strong position in the market as we work to fill this role. From a channel performance perspective in the first quarter, global wholesale segment revenue including distributors was the primary driver of growth increasing 25% versus last year. Strengthen these channels resulted primarily from continued global market share gains for HOKA, as well as the benefits from added doors with strategic accounts. UGG also contributed to wholesale revenue gains based on the continued adoption of the brand\u2019s diverse product assortment among international regions, which continue to benefit from marketplace reset activities. On direct-to-consumer global revenue for the first quarter increased 15% versus the prior year. DTC growth was driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition and retention for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by the category and seasonal dynamics unique to the UGG brand that I covered earlier in the call. Overall, our direct-to-consumer business continues to benefit from the HOKA brands growing influence, especially in quarters outside of historical peak selling periods for UGG. The quarter just completed HOKA represented 53% of DTC revenue, which is up from 39% last year and 27% 2 years ago, with nearly all of the HOKA brands DTC business occurring through e-commerce, our most profitable channel. This brand shift dynamic is a creative to our bottom line. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results, as well as our reaffirmed outlook on fiscal year 2023.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just shared our first quarter results demonstrated great progress toward the fiscal year guidance that we outlined in May, while we advanced a number of key initiatives for our business this quarter. HOKA was the primary driver of performance as the brand continues to build global market share. UGG revenue came in slightly lower than last year primarily due to category shifts occurring during the quarter, as well as lapping earlier selling during the prior year. But we feel the brand is well positioned to deliver another strong year and are excited for what lies ahead under Anne\u2019s leadership. With ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we\u2019re continuing our disciplined and responsible approach to managing our business and will remain nimble to react to this dynamic environment. Our demand signals lead us to believe that our portfolio brands will continue to resonate well with consumers. And though not immune to the macroeconomic headwinds, Deckers has historically demonstrated an ability to course correct when necessary. We remain committed to our long-term strategies that have continued to serve us well, and we\u2019ll build upon the strong operating model we have built over the last 5 years. Now, let\u2019s get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2023 results. First quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $614 million, up 22% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 55% versus last year accounting for nearly all of this quarter\u2019s revenue growth due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brands global ecosystem of access points, and improved inventory availability. For the first time ever, HOKA represented more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue, and over the last 12 months ended June 30, the brand has delivered over $1 billion of revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was 48%, which is down 360 basis points from last year\u2019s 51.6%. This aligned with our first half direction that anticipated headwinds from higher freight costs from ocean and air as well as impacts from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that we anticipate will pressure margins for the remainder of this year. Additionally, first quarter gross margin was impacted by product mix and normalized promotional activity for UGG as the brand sold more sandals and discounted select styles in line with pre-pandemic activity and channel mix shifting towards the wholesale and distributor segment, in particular, our international distributor business that shipped product earlier than in years past. These headwinds were partially offset from benefits from increased revenue mix of HOKA is the brand commanded the highest gross margin in the portfolio during Q1 and benefits from HOKA price increases. SG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $238 million, which is up 20% from last year\u2019s $199 million. As a percentage of revenue, we delivered 60 basis points of leverage to help offset freight and FX impact to gross margin. Our tax rate was 21.3%, which compares to 21.9% in the prior year. These results drove diluted earnings per share of $1.66 for the quarter, which was $0.05 below last year\u2019s $1.71 per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2022, we ended June with $695 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $840 million, up 83% versus the same point in time last year. And important to note that last year\u2019s inventory levels were below normal operating levels as a result of supply chain disruption and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average share price of $260.12. As of June 30 2022, the company had approximately $354 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1.2 billion on top of the company\u2019s existing share repurchase authorization, which now in total represents more than 15% of our market capitalization, highlighting the board\u2019s confidence in our long-term strategic plan. Now for supply chain update. Over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve shared an update on the status of our logistics network and our continued mitigation efforts as we navigate macro supply chain disruption. We are pleased that there have been relative improvement in this area in Q1, but I will share some brief thoughts before I touch on our fiscal year 2023 outlook. Transit times have improved relative to last year, but we are still experiencing latency and lower visibility into the timing of inventory with nearly 40% in transit, and thus are continuing to prioritize holding inventory in the country of sale. For example, during the first quarter inventory generally arrived earlier than anticipated, as a result, we shipped more product out. However, with low visibility into when certain shipments will arrive, we are comfortable holding higher levels of inventory to enable our brands to meet the significant marketplace demand we are seeing. So difficult to predict the timing of when inventory will land, we expect that heightened inventory levels will continue throughout this fiscal year. On the cost front, we are confident that the price increases implemented in the HOKA and UGG brands will offset freight headwinds and help bolster second half margins to deliver our full fiscal year 2023 guidance. Given the earlier arrival of inventory, we now expect to use less air freight than originally anticipated for the HOKA brand. However, as the dollar has continued to strengthen, we are anticipating greater currency headwinds, and this reduction in planned airfreight should help offset these currency pressures. Now, turning to our guidance. And with these dynamics in mind, we are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2023 guidance, which as a reminder includes revenue growth of 10% to 11% versus last year, gross margin 50 basis points higher than last year anticipating approximately 51.5%. SG&A at approximately 34% of revenue and operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%; a tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%; and with the share repurchase executed during the first quarter just completed, diluted earnings per share will now be expected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.35, reflecting a $0.10 increase. While we have maintained our overall guidance, I\u2019d like to highlight a few additional items contemplated within the guidance, which include stronger HOKA revenue growth now expected to increase in the 40% range versus last year, reflecting upside from greater inventory availability, which aligns to our expectation of using less air freight than originally anticipated, and incremental foreign currency headwinds, primarily affecting UGG growth due to the brands wholesale business model and concentration of planned growth from the international regions. This reaffirmation of guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include but are not limited to further impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we believe in the power of our brands and continue to see positive signs of consumer demand. Deckers has a history of remaining nimble displaying the unique ability to react as marketplace dynamics evolve, and we are well positioned to deliver compelling revenue growth and top tier operating margins. Thanks, everyone. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. We are quite pleased with the start to fiscal year 2023. As our portfolio drove revenue growth above 20% in the first quarter, and our organization continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives. I want to congratulate the entire HOKA team and all of the shared service individuals that support the brand on reaching the billion dollar revenue milestone. This is a huge feat for HOKA but also for Deckers as a whole to have a second brand in our portfolio to reach this significant point of scale. The exciting part for our company is that we believe HOKA has much more growth ahead as the brand stays laser focused on rhis strategic expansion plan. The brand\u2019s fly human fly campaign is just the beginning of our journey to build awareness and broaden the consumer aperture for HOKA. From a talent perspective, we are fortunate to have bolstered our executive leadership team with the recent promotion of Angela Ogbechie to Chief Supply Chain Officer, and the hiring of Anne Spangenberg as President of Fashion Lifestyle. I\u2019m excited to be working closely with both of these experienced leaders and look forward to their contributions that are sure to further enhance Deckers workplace culture, and drive success against our long-term strategic initiatives. I\u2019d also like to thank our executive leadership team and all of our employees for remaining flexible and staying focused on our goals, while managing through transition. With our strong portfolio of brands, dedicated employees and discipline management of the business, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this excited for the opportunities ahead for Deckers. And I view the Board of Directors recently approved increased to our share repurchase authorization, which in total now represents more than 15% of Deckers current market capitalization as an impressive vote of confidence in our company, brands, people and strategic plan for the future of our organization. A big thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask just first on the UGG brand. Curious to maybe get your thoughts on just the overall health of the UGG brand in the marketplace, maybe this is more of a domestic question. But just levels of inventory comfort with orders that you may have with your wholesale partners and just overall thoughts on how you expect UGG to fare in the current environment?\nDave Powers: Yeah. This is Dave. I can answer the beginning of that. We\u2019re pleased with how UGG is performing. It\u2019s down a little bit for the quarter as expected. And that\u2019s largely due to us trying to lap the Fluff Yeah business from last year. So you can attribute pretty much all the miss or the decline versus last year, I should say, to the Fluff franchise. And we\u2019ve made up some ground on that with Sport Yeah, and some of the other classic slippers which are doing well. But the Sport Yeah is at a lower price point. So, as an example, on our e-commerce website in the U.S., sales were down for UGG brand, but units were up. So it\u2019s a quarterly dynamic, we\u2019re working through the tail end of the fluff business. But their core business across the globe is still strong and healthy. Our order book is strong and healthy. And, we feel that our chances are good in the rest of the year and we certainly have the inventory in place to do that. Steve can talk a little bit more about the inventory. But the good news is we have inventory here. It\u2019s here earlier, and we\u2019re able to get it to our accounts earlier. So the setup from a brand perspective, going into the back half of the year is still looking good. But we\u2019re being a little bit cautious here, because it\u2019s still early in the year and there\u2019s a lot of concerns about over inventory in the channel and the consumer. But as far as the brand health goes globally, we\u2019re still seeing very positive signs, order books are still looking healthy. And we have inventory should the business be there to be after.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, I think, Jon, just to add on to that, as Dave said, order books holding up we\u2019re seeing strong demand for the brand so we feel good about that. As we said on inventory, we were going to bring inventory in earlier this year, so kind of on message we\u2019re delivering on that. That is contributing to an increase in our inventory levels, which again, just remind everybody at last year\u2019s levels were unusually low and below normal operating level. So feel okay with the inventory, where it stands, that will continue to build, but we\u2019re well positioned from that standpoint to fulfill the orders that we have. And we\u2019re continuing to see consumer response to it. So still very positive on how UGG is performing and the outlook. And then just to remind everybody, we\u2019re coming off too strong years of UGG growth. And as we said well documented through last year, it was replenishing depleted levels of inventory in the channel. So we\u2019re comping strong growth as well as replenishing inventory and feel comfortable about that.\nJonathan Komp: Yeah, great. And then maybe just one separate question on HOKA. Dave, I think you mentioned broadening the aperture of the brand, and I wanted to just follow-up and get your thoughts, maybe both near-term any specific initiatives, and then longer-term? What your views of that comment, and the opportunity for HOKA that you see today?\nDave Powers: Yeah, it\u2019s really related to two things. One is just expanding the reach of the product to reach new consumers, and then also expanding our reach internationally, particularly in China. But this is at its core, a running brand, and we have incredible authenticity, and are very important brand in that space. And we\u2019ll maintain that authenticity as we go forward. Hence, the Western states and the UTMB, and the Ironman championships that is the core of this brand, and always will be. But we obviously see expanded opportunity in trail and hike, and then in walking and also lifestyle. So, we are well aware of the fact that there\u2019s a broad base of consumers that are purchasing the HOKA brand across age groups demographics and end use. And so with the new Fly Human Fly campaign that we launched, reestablishing our authenticity in ultra sports with the events that I mentioned. And at the same time speaking to a broader base consumer that is into the brand for a lifestyle perspective, or walking perspective, or just overall comfort. So we welcome all those consumers, we consider them athletes, they\u2019re on their feet all day, and they need performance footwear, and we\u2019re working on ways to establish more communication and engagement with those folks, while staying true to the authenticity of the brand. And that\u2019s more on a product standpoint, we\u2019re not necessarily opening up new distribution to go after those consumers. We\u2019re pleased with the business index, but we\u2019re in less than 20% of their stores, just starting to go into footlocker and opening more stores globally, particularly in China, where we\u2019re seeing a broad base of consumers coming into our stores and on our websites really loving the brand. But what\u2019s also incredibly exciting on the lower age spectrum is 18 to 34 year olds are increasingly purchasing the HOKA brand. We\u2019re starting to hear comments about people are trading their all white Nikes, for all white HOKAs, so that\u2019s very encouraging for us as well. And we knew a lot of optimism going into the account \u2013 of Foot Locker account to see what we can do with the younger consumer there too.\nJonathan Komp: That\u2019s great color. Thanks again.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jon.\nSteven Fasching: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, I\u2019m just going to do my normal question. Can you give us that you sort of talked a little bit about it on earlier, but can you give us wholesale revenue by category or brand, please?\nErinn Kohler: Hi, Sam, sure. This is Erinn. So wholesale distributor net sales, I\u2019ll give you just that component by brand. So for UGG, that was $138 million, HOKA $232 million, Teva $47 million, Sanuk $11 million, and then all other which includes Koolaburra $2 million. So that gets you to your total wholesale distributor of $429 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you very much. Then a couple of \u2013 two more. You lost a bunch of sales in UGG, evenly a good quarter in the third quarter of last year. How are you seeing the third quarter of this year now that your inventory is flowing better? And then with HOKA you\u2019re doing $330 million, can you give us some idea of the cadence to get to the 40% increase that you\u2019re thinking about, because $330 million well above any quarter you\u2019ve ever had. And is that a new normal? Or how should we think about the flow of revenue there to get to the 40%?\nDave Powers: Yeah, so I\u2019ll start with UGG. And then, I\u2019ll let Steve tackle the HOKA question. So we\u2019re optimistic about UGG in the queue in Q3, as you said, we were late on inventory last year. We potentially missed some sales last year. And the good news is that we have inventory, obviously, in the channel earlier, and we have more inventory coming. So from an inventory standpoint, I think we\u2019re going to be in very good shape for Q3. There\u2019s just a lot of questions out there still on the consumer level of promotions, et cetera. We\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019ve in the last couple of years for UGG in Q3, we\u2019ve been very, very clean, minimal promotions, tight on inventory. We see a little bit of return to normalize season, but we\u2019re not expecting or modeling in heavy promotional activity at this point. We want to protect the health of the brand and not chase top-line, because we think we can make up a lot of revenue if we need to, on the year with HOKA. But as far as how the setup looks, we\u2019re in inventory position, we have exciting new product launches in the UGG brand, we think are going to resonate very well. And we have a new campaign, a holiday campaign that we\u2019re working on right now. So as far as tackling the opportunity, we\u2019re in good shape. I think their question is their macroeconomic environment globally, and what that\u2019s going to do to not necessarily just the brand, but the wholesale partners, who are tight on inventory as well or heavy on inventory in general.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, then Sam on the HOKA question, what we said and kind of indicated in a strong quarter one performance, where we ship more product was increased availability of inventory in June, and that was largely driven by HOKA. And so that gave us an opportunity to ship product more than what we kind of anticipated could happen with the availability of inventory, that was largely HOKA driven, right? And so, I think what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter is our ability to get that product into the market a little bit sooner than what we expected, which is always encouraging and will closely watch them sell through. But that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of this timing issue. And, again, going back to why we\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance. We\u2019re just seeing timing, shifting between quarters. And so it\u2019s very difficult with what we\u2019re dealing with to kind of precisely show when things are going to go. But when we have an opportunity to move product out a little bit earlier than what we anticipated, we\u2019re going to take full advantage of it. And that\u2019s really what you\u2019ve seen with HOKA in this quarter.\nSam Poser: Yeah. One last thing, do you expect the DTC business to outgrow wholesale this year, given sort of the some of the maneuvers at the end of last year in the wholesale shipments?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, I think right now, the way we\u2019re kind of looking at things is equivalent between those channels. So, still early and we\u2019ll see, but right now, the way we\u2019re looking at is kind of equivalent.\nSam Poser: Thank you for continued success.\nDave Powers: Yeah. Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on HOKA and the global marketing campaign. Dave, were there any key learnings you could share with us from that campaign? And can you remind us, I think in the 10-K for fiscal year 2022 marketing was about 8% of sales meaningfully up over from like a few years ago got 5%, which is great to see. Steve, where do you think marketing goes for this fiscal year? And can you maybe talk a little bit about the nuances, the spread maybe in terms of marketing spend, as a percentage of sales differed between the two big brands?\nDave Powers: Yeah, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about HOKA. This is the first global campaign that the brand has ever done. So we felt that it\u2019s important to refresh the messaging and the communication from the brand. And, we\u2019ve obviously evolved our thinking as to what this brand can be for folks globally. And, we\u2019ve been on a track of inspiring athletes all around the world of all types to get active and be there for them. And so this is a way for us to bring all the different product launches that we go through, whether it\u2019s a Clifton, or Bondi, or Speedgoat, to have a little bit more consistency in the look and feel of the campaign to have a consistent tone of voice and to be more consistent with global consumers around the globe. So we\u2019re very pleased with how it\u2019s been received. We\u2019re getting very positive feedback from our wholesale partners. We\u2019re getting very positive KPIs on our website. The amount of new visitors for the quarter was up tremendously and very healthy for us, as you see in some of the retention and acquisition figures are all heading in the right direction. And we think this is a foundation and a story that we can continue to build on head to toe and build real power, and an aspirational positioning for the brand. So far, so good. I think we need to add in a little bit more grittiness, if that\u2019s the right word into the campaign and pull off some of the great performances and athletes in the UTMB and Western states in Ironman and leverage those influencers a little bit more in the campaign. But we feel the platform is right. The redesign of the website is proven to be very successful so far, our landing page, spend time and dwell time and conversion rates are up. And so we\u2019re very pleased. But it\u2019s the beginning of a long journey with this campaign. And but so far, we\u2019re seeing great adoption globally, and positive reaction from consumers and wholesale accounts.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Hi, Laurent, this is Steve. Just on the marketing spend. We \u2013 over the past few years, we have been increasing marketing spend. As it relates to brands, we spend more in marketing on proportional basis to sales on HOKA and we do other brands, and that is part of what\u2019s driving our overall market increase and marketing as a percentage of revenue increase. What we\u2019re seeing, as Dave just articulated is great productivity with our marketing spend. And what\u2019s contributing to building brand awareness, as we talked about quite a bit, HOKA brand awareness is still relatively low in comparison to other brands. And so, with the marketing spend, with the campaigns that we\u2019re launching, we\u2019re seeing great productivity and how that\u2019s driving consumer awareness of the brand and building brand awareness. So it\u2019s a lever that we\u2019re using very efficiently and productively and will continue to do that. And as you\u2019ve seen with the global campaign, and as Dave said, we\u2019ll continue to refine and continue to build awareness through those campaigns.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That\u2019s great. Great to hear. And then as a follow-up question, I think, you mentioned in your remarks, Dave, on Foot Locker, maybe you can give us a little more granularity on what type of consumer you\u2019re seeing there. What\u2019s the response? And then, Steve, I think in your 10-K, you signed another lease for a pretty significant distribution center. That should be up and running over the next year or two followed by the Indiana Distribution Center last year. Can you just maybe kind of frame up the need for that? Is that is that to really focus on the multibillion dollar target for HOKA. Is there a channel effort there? It\u2019s in wholesale DTC any color on that would be very helpful. Thank you\nDave Powers: Sure. I\u2019ll tackle Foot Locker first. So it\u2019s early days, we just put the product in Foot Locker. It\u2019s in a handful of position stores that we feel are right for the consumer going after, which is younger, more athletic minded, but still fashion minded consumer in stores that we think the Foot Locker group can represent the brand positively, and then we\u2019re online with some styles as well. So too early to share any results, but I will say that, we\u2019re pleased with how it\u2019s the launch has gone, we\u2019re pleased with the feedback we\u2019re getting from footlocker. As I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing younger consumers, more increasingly adopt the brand. So we feel good about it long-term. So far, so good at the launch, we\u2019re going to take our time and maintain the discipline that we always have with expanding distribution, much like we\u2019ve done with Dick\u2019s. But both of those are strategic and reaching consumers where they want to shop in environments that can showcase the brand in a positive way, they\u2019re both doing that. And we\u2019re going to continue to monitor and see how things go. But there\u2019s no major plans to drastically increase door count. We\u2019re still in less than 20% of Dick stores. And you can see the results we\u2019re getting through our own DTC channels, so very healthy right now. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor these and trickle out distribution.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. And just on the distribution centers, Laurent, we are, as you mentioned, expanding our presence and space available that is in part to handle the growth that we anticipate with the business and specifically kind of help handle the additional growth in the HOKA business. We do have levers as well. So there \u2013 we have other arrangements in 3PLs that we can change distribution patterns. But we have our main facility in Moreno Valley. We\u2019re increasing space in the Midwest, as you mentioned, we also have some distribution through 3PLs on the East Coast that we can also look at. So it\u2019s helping us plan for the future. We know these things take time. What I would also say is, we\u2019re introducing more automation. And so a big part of what we\u2019re developing in the Midwest is an increased automated fulfillment center, so being able to be efficient as we get those up and running efficiently. So more to come on that, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at that.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That\u2019s just great to hear. Thank you very much for taking my questions.\nSteven Fasching: Right.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy: Thank you. Good afternoon. Really nice, guys. I wanted to ask about the state of wholesale channel inventories in this specialty running channel, HOKA has clearly been a share gainer. But the category has been very strong. Do you feel HOKA has caught up on having inventory in equilibrium in that channel now? And then, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any indications of moderating growth in the category that that\u2019s catching some of the other brands wrong footed on inventory?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, Jim, this is Steve. Good question. We\u2019re watching that carefully. And as you mentioned, we are growing our presence and inventory has increased, we are not at some inventory levels, of some of the others, but our productivity is much higher than other brands. So run specialty is highly productive, I think, we\u2019re probably the most productive brand in many of those outlets, that\u2019s leading to significant turnover of that inventory, so our ability to fulfill it. So, I think, again, as inventory increases, as we have more inventory available, we\u2019re going to continue to feed that channel, there\u2019s more opportunity, I think, and our teams believe that as well. So we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of that. And now especially with a better inventory position, we\u2019re better positioned to continue to go after that business.\nDave Powers: And I think also, we\u2019re hearing a little bit that some of the run specialty accounts are full, in general with not just HOKA inventory, but all their inventory. So there\u2019s a limited capacity to be able to bring in additional inventory. But as Steve said, the productivity of HOKA versus others is exceptional, high retail, high margin full price sales. So but we have the inventory now and on the way to be able to manage that channel much better than we have in the last two years. We were really in chase mode.\nJim Duffy: The brand indicators super encouraging five of the top 10 styles that\u2019s really impressive.\nDave Powers: Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing on that is we are working on in a more innovative launches. So we\u2019re going to bring innovation and new ideas to market faster, and we\u2019re going to use a lot utilize that channel to do some tests and learn along the way as well and get some new innovative products out faster, utilizing DTC and the run specialty channel at the beginning of calendar year 2023.\nJim Duffy: Great. And Dave, I also want to ask about the addition of Anne Spangenberg, what\u2019s the particular skill set that Anne brings to you that makes her well suited to lead the fashion lifestyle division. And what are the areas you\u2019re most excited about her opportunities to have an impact?\nDave Powers: Yeah, we are collectively, as ELT as a board and as an organization very excited to have and join the company. She has been here now almost three weeks, she\u2019s hit the ground running. She has been a fantastic addition to the ELT. I would say first and foremost, she is the right kind of leader for Deckers. She\u2019s an inspirational leader. She\u2019s an empathetic leader. She\u2019s got incredible experience over her years in Nike, all within merchandising, and storytelling, and brand building. She spent 3 years on the ground in China, redeveloping repositioning that market, and oversaw just a massive business for Nike. And so, the core talent that we love about Anne, she is an exceptional merchant, first and foremost, she understands and appreciates products, she understands how to bring product to market in a compelling way with head to toe storytelling. She knows footwear and apparel. And she\u2019s not from the fashion space. But you know, we have a full team of people who are experts in that space. And what we\u2019re really looking for here is an inspirational leader who can get the best out of that team. And at the same time, really editing and amplifying our storytelling, which is something a lot of people learned from Nike over the years. So we think just the combination of her leadership and merchandising experience, the global execution that she was overseeing at Nike gives us great leadership for this brand and can unlock the true potential of this brand going beyond the $2 billion that it\u2019s at now.\nJim Duffy: Very good. Thank you, guys.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another great quarter.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nJohn Kernan: Could you talk to price increases you realized in Q1 and what you\u2019re planning for the back half of the year and the impact to gross margin as you\u2019re planning? Thank you.\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, John, this is Steve. We haven\u2019t changed anything from what we\u2019ve said previously. So, we have introduced at the beginning of this calendar year price increases related to HOKA, we\u2019re seeing that drive some of the gross margin improvement. Clearly, that\u2019s being and has been offset with the higher freight. It\u2019s helping mitigate some of the pressures. And we\u2019ll continue to face that relate into the next quarter. What we\u2019ve also said and haven\u2019t changed our stance on is price increases on related select product for UGG, that\u2019ll really kick in our Q3. Again, that was part of what we indicated on our initial guidance. So we haven\u2019t changed anything there. So no change in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about price increases, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that. But our prices are pretty well set for the seasons, and would be more a future opportunity, not anything we would expect in this year.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I think for UGG, specifically, we raised prices and about 30% on the line for Q3. So, but in places where we think we can get it, and we\u2019ve heard that from our wholesale partners that we can get that as well. Yeah.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned specialty running being a little bit full on the wholesale side of things for HOKA. Anything else any other detail you can give as it relates to the wholesale channel for both UGG and HOKA. We have heard some updates from some of your peers in the sector. And it does sound like there\u2019s some caution building in that wholesale channel.\nDave Powers: Yeah, I mean, from what I\u2019m hearing,, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s caution. But I think wholesalers are filling up on inventory. They\u2019ve been light, for many of their key brands over the last couple of years. And they\u2019re filling up. And logistics is still a challenge for brands and wholesalers. Space is becoming a challenge. And so we\u2019re hearing a little bit about that out there in the marketplace, which is why we think it\u2019s good that we got inventory in early and we were able to get inventory into the channel to capture that space. So I think it\u2019s going to be a dynamic this year that wholesale is going to have to work through as they tried to fill up their inventories and get back in the right position heading into the rest of the year. So we don\u2019t see it really affecting our business yet. Demand is still strong, brand health is so strong. We\u2019re not hearing you know, about crazy cancellations or anything. It\u2019s pretty normalized. So we still feel good about our chances. But that is a dynamic that we\u2019re hearing about.\nJohn Kernan: Understood. Thank you.\nDave Powers: All right. Thanks, John.\nSteven Fasching: Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. I\u2019m curious if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the trends that you saw on the DTC side of the business for each of the brands as you kind of progressed throughout the quarter have things kind of held steady throughout, if you saw sort of ups and downs in the business on the DTC side, or maybe a deterioration issue is moved along again, both for UGG and HOKA. And curious if you could just talk about the inventory a little bit more, I think you mentioned your \u2013 you had a high percentage of goods in transit, just curious what the comparison was, versus a year ago and what inventory looks like in terms of units on hand versus last year? Thanks.\nDave Powers: Yeah, so I\u2019ll talk about e-commerce a little bit. As you saw from the HOKA results, very healthy quarter for UGG, we did see a lift with the new campaign and the launch, when that kicked in. And so that helped in the back half of the quarter, created a little more excitement, a little more awareness, the first time visitors was in the 70% range. And so, very healthy business has continues to be repeat purchasers, new consumers, younger consumers coming to the site, better KPIs, as I mentioned, on the landing pages and conversion on those pages. So that\u2019s really good. And it\u2019s broad base, it\u2019s across all categories is not really a standout amongst the group. It\u2019s just the whole brand is seeing that level of interest in adoption. Within UGG, the real challenge for DTC, as I mentioned is within the slipper category. And, it\u2019s a combination of the Fluff business slowing down dramatically from where it was a year ago, still aided by the pandemic. So that\u2019s slowed down but we\u2019ve made up some ground with the Sport Yeah. But it\u2019s at a lower price point. So as I mentioned, revenue in DTC was down or e-commerce was down for UGG, but units were up. So I think, as I said, at the point in time dynamic has still think the core business, so I know this core businesses feel strong, heritage slippers still strong, and men still strong. A little softness in kids, but that was also politely related. So aside from that, the brand is still performing on expectation in the categories that we needed to. And as I said, as we get into Q2 and Q3, the Fluff dynamics will be behind us, and it\u2019ll be a more normalized business.\nSteven Fasching: And then, Paul, just a little bit on the inventory, in terms of the in transit percentage wise were a little bit better, but on a higher dollar amounts, so we have higher dollar amounts still in transit. I think that\u2019s important to note. And then embedded in that inventory this year versus last year is about $70 million more of additional freight, as rates increased throughout last year. So we\u2019re dealing with a significant amount more of freight, embedded in those higher inventory values as well. And then the other with large percentage increase related to HOKA is we\u2019re ramping the HOKA inventory to support the growth in that business that\u2019s contributing to the higher inventory balance. And just to remind everyone, the average price on a HOKA is greater than the average. So that\u2019s contributing to a lift as well.\nPaul Lejuez: Did you say, did you give a breakdown of HOKA versus UGG inventory?\nSteven Fasching: No. We don\u2019t.\nPaul Lejuez: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nSteven Fasching: All right.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jay Sole, and this will be the last question. He\u2019s with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you for taking my question. You gave a bunch of the key factors that impacted the gross margin in the quarter. Is it possible to give us a little bit more detail around say how much the supply chain cost effective, the gross margin and basis points and then on the supply chain, you mentioned, you\u2019re starting to see some improvement. And you give us a sense of how much it\u2019s improved and what kind of visibility you have into the trajectory of those challenges, maybe getting easier as we go through the fiscal year?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah. Sure, Jay. So this is Steve. So of the 360 basis point decline versus last year in the quarter, roughly 260 of it is increased freight. So that\u2019s related to both ocean and air, because we did use some air in Q1, which a year ago, we didn\u2019t start using air freight last year until later in the year. So that\u2019ll be where we\u2019re going to have some headwinds in the first half of the year versus tailwinds when you get into the latter part of the year, so roughly 260 on freight, there\u2019s about 50 basis points related to FX and then everything else were kind of all the other things that we stated. Yeah. And just to remind you, the freight again, as we talked about is inclusive of air and ocean. And then the second part of your question was?\nJay Sole: Just on the supply chain, you said, some improvements, like \u2013 yeah, how do you think it trends from here?\nSteven Fasching: Yeah, so what we\u2019re seeing and this is what\u2019s contributed to the strong first quarter. We have seen an improvement, as we mentioned, in the prepared remarks. So product is flowing in a little bit sooner than what we anticipated. So we\u2019re seeing things flow. The visibility is still limited, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, too. So we\u2019re still trying to get better gauges on arrival of inventory. Good news is, on the West Coast port, labor negotiations, that\u2019s still ongoing, so we haven\u2019t seen disruption related to that. But again still ongoing, so we\u2019ll keep a close eye on that. So again, seen inventory come in better, which is good, gives us an ability like we demonstrated in the quarter with June and with HOKA and ability to move it out and be in a better position than we were a year ago in order to kind of meet some of the demand. So we\u2019ll see how things go. We\u2019re continuing to work on that continuing to look at ways to improve, but encouraged by some of the improvements that we have seen, but continuing to look for further improvement.\nJay Sole: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to dive into another quarter of exceptional results, which represent a strong start to fiscal year 2023 and further progress towards our long-term strategies. First quarter revenue increased 22% versus last year to $614 million, and we delivered earnings per share of $1.66. Revenue growth was primarily driven by HOKA as the brand achieved its first ever $300 million quarter. With strong HOKA growth, we were able to deliver another profitable first quarter as we continue to reduce the historical seasonality of our portfolio through the expansion of year round HOKA demand and further diversifying the category mix. Importantly, our first quarter result demonstrated momentum behind our long-term vision to build HOKA into a multibillion dollar major player in the performance athletic space further diversify the UGG brands product, geographic and seasonal mix, grow our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention, and drive international markets through strategic investments. We are making clear progress in each of these initiatives. During the first quarter, HOKA delivered global revenue of $330 million, an increase of 55% versus last year. UGG products mix shifted into sandals away from seasonal fall styles. UGG regional mix shifted towards international regions, as these markets drove year-over-year revenue growth. Global DTC across all brands grew 15% as a result of increasing consumer acquisition and retention by 13% and 28%, respectively, and revenue from international markets increased 36% versus last year, which includes earlier distributor shipments. These highlights reflect the strength of Deckers marketplace management and omni-channel capabilities across our portfolio of exciting brands. Our disciplined approach to managing brands, markets and distribution channels continues to serve us well, as we create the future of Deckers. While the macroeconomic environment is evolving quickly, I'm confident in a consumer demand of our brands and our team's ability to remain nimble and deliver on our goals in this dynamic environment. Steve will provide further details around our forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let's dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Starting with the brand highlights, global HOKA revenue for the first quarter increased 55% versus last year to $330 million. This is a significant achievement that resulted in HOKA global revenue and the trailing 12 months, and in June 30, breaking the billion dollar barrier with much more growth ahead. The HOKA brands exceptional growth also delivered a new milestone for Deckers as a whole with HOKA revenue representing more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue for the first time. With its year on-demand that utilizes infrastructure during off peak UGG periods and full price selling at premium price points. The HOKA brands growing scale is improving Deckers overall quarterly financial and operational performance. The HOKA brands strong quarter featured outstanding revenue growth across the brands far reaching global ecosystem of access points highlighted by international markets increasing 66% versus last year, led by the strength of the EMEA region, which was partially influenced by the timing of selling for our distributors as we strategically build new markets. U.S. increasing 49% versus last year, with DTC growth leading wholesale global DTC increasing 58% versus last year, driven by continued momentum with retained consumers, as well as the continued acquisition of new consumers and global wholesale increasing 53% versus last year, as the brand increased market share and existing accounts and benefited from select doors added to strategic accounts. We were excited by the positive brand indicators and continued share gains that HOKA is building upon across its entire global distribution network. A few highlights include increasing market share within U.S. run specialty, while commanding higher retail prices. Focus styles accounting for at least half of the top 10 styles according to aggregated U.S. run specialty store data. Doubling revenue in France led by gains in Paris, which was our third fastest growing European city during the quarter, and APAC driving the highest regional GDP growth rate led by strengthen both China and Japan as these countries benefited from stores eating awareness with consumers. Across the globe HOKA stores have continued to build excitement with a new audience and drive compelling levels of traffic and purchase activity. This is especially exciting in China, which has been a slow build as HOKA took some time to find its voice with consumers local to the region. With a refined visual merchandising strategy enhancing the consumer experience, our China's stores are now driving higher conversion rates and we're better equipped as we open additional locations in the region. In the U.S., the retail team continues to work towards opening the HOKA brands first permanent location in New York City during the spring of calendar year 2023. This is an exciting endeavor as the HOKA store will feature an elevated design that is fit for our premier performance brand. In the meantime, HOKA is opening a second New York City pop-up location near Lincoln Center within the next month. Our Chicago location which was opened in the last 3 months is seeing excellent traffic and driving strong conversion, giving us even greater confidence in a consumer appetite for HOKA retail stores. We will take a disciplined approach to opening a limited number of doors. But we're excited about the opportunity to engage with consumers in key cities around the world. Further on direct-to-consumer across global markets, HOKA continues to increase the number of acquired and retained consumers that remarkable levels compared to the prior year. During the quarter, DTC acquisition increased 48% and retention increased 58% versus last year, with gains among 18 to 34 year old consumers far outpacing these increases. This led to a 4 percentage point increase in the mix of 18 to 34 year old, among individuals purchasing from hoka.com. We are seeing incredible momentum behind HOKA as the brand continues to inspire humans to fly over the earth. The HOKA brand ethos is echoed through its new globally integrated marketing campaign dubbed Fly Human Fly. This campaign was thoughtfully designed as an invitation for humans around the world to experience the HOKA arrived. As part of the campaign, HOKA launched the fifth edition of the Mach, which has quickly become a top 5 style for the brand, as well as a completely redesigned consumer website. The upgraded website features a brand new aesthetic that elevates product presentation with greater technical detail and enhances the visibility of brand values and storytelling throughout the site. Fly human fly has been live for just over a month now. And we've been very pleased with the consumer response and feedback for our wholesale partners. But the fly human fly landing page at hoka.com, 83% of visitors were new, which aligns with the campaign's intent to reach a new audience. We believe this campaign will have a significant impact on building awareness of HOKA as we expand the brand into a multibillion dollar major player in the performance space over the long-term. Speaking of performance, I'd like to congratulate HOKA sponsored athlete, Adam Peterman, for winning the 100 mile 2022 Western states race. This was an incredible feat for Adam having this been his first time ever competing in 100 mile race. He won while wearing recently launched HOKA Speedgoat 5, which is a completely redesigned version of the brand's most popular trail shoe with less weight and enhanced traction with Vibram Megagrip to inspire confidence in any terrain. Results like these emphasize that HOKA brands leadership is a premier performance brand, enabling athletes to achieve peak levels of performance. Other congratulations to Adam and all the other athletes who competed in this year's HOKA sponsored Western states 100. Moving to UGG, global revenue in the quarter decreased 2% versus last year to $208 million dollars. Outperformance was driven by higher international wholesale and distributor selling that was offset by category shift dynamics, impacting the brands global direct-to-consumer business. The UGG brands international regions continue to experience benefits from the marketplace allocation and segmentation strategies implemented to build brand heat and increased demand overseas. With core fall product limited in the marketplace that was able to drive full price sell through during the past holiday season, and generate open buy opportunities in the spring season, driving the quarter's results. UGG captured incremental market share with transition styles such as the Ultra Mini and Coquette as well as the newly launched Sport Yeah sandal, all of which are driving sell through. Briefly touching on the category dynamics impacting UGG global DTC. Over the last couple of years, the Fluff franchise experienced increased relevance as consumers turn to UGG for comfortable and stylish hybrid slippers to wear in the home. Expecting shifts in consumer behavior towards outdoor wearing, the UGG product team continued to evolve the franchise with the introduction of more spring, summer and outdoor ready styles, which included the Sport Yes Sandal. Sandals were the standout category for UGG during the quarter showing the strong demand for the brand outside of the fall and winter timeframe. While successful in shifting consumer adoption from heritage fluff franchise styles into beach ready styles. The lower average selling price in the sandal category created a revenue headwind relative to the exceptional volumes of Fluff that were sold during Q1 in the last 2 years. That said, the Fluff Yeah continues to be as top style among acquire and retain consumers, including with 18 to 34 year old. Across a global direct-to-consumer even though revenue dollars are below last year due to these product mix shifts, demand for UGG remain robust as the brand experienced increases of 8% and 13% and acquired and retain consumers respectively versus the prior year. Importantly, international DTC acquisition and retention gains are trending well ahead of these global figures as we continue to build brand heat overseas. He styles driving new consumer acquisition globally include the aforementioned Fluff Yeah and Sport Yeah, as well as the Clem in golden star fashion sandals, and the Tasman franchise which continues to be on fire. We are encouraged by the continued consumer interest and broader adoption of the UGG brands diverse product assortment. Overall, the first quarter represented a solid start to the year for UGG. We believe UGG is well positioned to drive a successful fiscal year 2023. And I'm even more excited for the brand's future, after our recent announcement of Anne Spangenberg as the President of Fashion Lifestyle. Anne as a proven leader with meaningful experience building brands across our industry, most recently serving as Nike's Chief Merchant, and has already hit the ground running in the last few weeks as she begins to immerse herself with all things UGG, and engage with our talented brand team and cross functional business partners. In her new role, and we'll be building upon the strategic priorities for UGG, focusing on product diversification, consumer adoption and franchise evolution across our omni-channel marketplace. I'd like to welcome, Anne, and thank the UGG team for the cross functional collaboration and teamwork that enabled the brand to maintain a strong position in the market as we work to fill this role. From a channel performance perspective in the first quarter, global wholesale segment revenue including distributors was the primary driver of growth increasing 25% versus last year. Strengthen these channels resulted primarily from continued global market share gains for HOKA, as well as the benefits from added doors with strategic accounts. UGG also contributed to wholesale revenue gains based on the continued adoption of the brand's diverse product assortment among international regions, which continue to benefit from marketplace reset activities. On direct-to-consumer global revenue for the first quarter increased 15% versus the prior year. DTC growth was driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition and retention for the HOKA brand, which was partially offset by the category and seasonal dynamics unique to the UGG brand that I covered earlier in the call. Overall, our direct-to-consumer business continues to benefit from the HOKA brands growing influence, especially in quarters outside of historical peak selling periods for UGG. The quarter just completed HOKA represented 53% of DTC revenue, which is up from 39% last year and 27% 2 years ago, with nearly all of the HOKA brands DTC business occurring through e-commerce, our most profitable channel. This brand shift dynamic is a creative to our bottom line. With that, I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results, as well as our reaffirmed outlook on fiscal year 2023. Thanks, Steve. We are quite pleased with the start to fiscal year 2023. As our portfolio drove revenue growth above 20% in the first quarter, and our organization continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives. I want to congratulate the entire HOKA team and all of the shared service individuals that support the brand on reaching the billion dollar revenue milestone. This is a huge feat for HOKA but also for Deckers as a whole to have a second brand in our portfolio to reach this significant point of scale. The exciting part for our company is that we believe HOKA has much more growth ahead as the brand stays laser focused on rhis strategic expansion plan. The brand's fly human fly campaign is just the beginning of our journey to build awareness and broaden the consumer aperture for HOKA. From a talent perspective, we are fortunate to have bolstered our executive leadership team with the recent promotion of Angela Ogbechie to Chief Supply Chain Officer, and the hiring of Anne Spangenberg as President of Fashion Lifestyle. I'm excited to be working closely with both of these experienced leaders and look forward to their contributions that are sure to further enhance Deckers workplace culture, and drive success against our long-term strategic initiatives. I'd also like to thank our executive leadership team and all of our employees for remaining flexible and staying focused on our goals, while managing through transition. With our strong portfolio of brands, dedicated employees and discipline management of the business, I don't think I've ever been this excited for the opportunities ahead for Deckers. And I view the Board of Directors recently approved increased to our share repurchase authorization, which in total now represents more than 15% of Deckers current market capitalization as an impressive vote of confidence in our company, brands, people and strategic plan for the future of our organization. A big thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yeah. This is Dave. I can answer the beginning of that. We're pleased with how UGG is performing. It's down a little bit for the quarter as expected. And that's largely due to us trying to lap the Fluff Yeah business from last year. So you can attribute pretty much all the miss or the decline versus last year, I should say, to the Fluff franchise. And we've made up some ground on that with Sport Yeah, and some of the other classic slippers which are doing well. But the Sport Yeah is at a lower price point. So, as an example, on our e-commerce website in the U.S., sales were down for UGG brand, but units were up. So it's a quarterly dynamic, we're working through the tail end of the fluff business. But their core business across the globe is still strong and healthy. Our order book is strong and healthy. And, we feel that our chances are good in the rest of the year and we certainly have the inventory in place to do that. Steve can talk a little bit more about the inventory. But the good news is we have inventory here. It's here earlier, and we're able to get it to our accounts earlier. So the setup from a brand perspective, going into the back half of the year is still looking good. But we're being a little bit cautious here, because it's still early in the year and there's a lot of concerns about over inventory in the channel and the consumer. But as far as the brand health goes globally, we're still seeing very positive signs, order books are still looking healthy. And we have inventory should the business be there to be after. Yeah, it's really related to two things. One is just expanding the reach of the product to reach new consumers, and then also expanding our reach internationally, particularly in China. But this is at its core, a running brand, and we have incredible authenticity, and are very important brand in that space. And we'll maintain that authenticity as we go forward. Hence, the Western states and the UTMB, and the Ironman championships that is the core of this brand, and always will be. But we obviously see expanded opportunity in trail and hike, and then in walking and also lifestyle. So, we are well aware of the fact that there's a broad base of consumers that are purchasing the HOKA brand across age groups demographics and end use. And so with the new Fly Human Fly campaign that we launched, reestablishing our authenticity in ultra sports with the events that I mentioned. And at the same time speaking to a broader base consumer that is into the brand for a lifestyle perspective, or walking perspective, or just overall comfort. So we welcome all those consumers, we consider them athletes, they're on their feet all day, and they need performance footwear, and we're working on ways to establish more communication and engagement with those folks, while staying true to the authenticity of the brand. And that's more on a product standpoint, we're not necessarily opening up new distribution to go after those consumers. We're pleased with the business index, but we're in less than 20% of their stores, just starting to go into footlocker and opening more stores globally, particularly in China, where we're seeing a broad base of consumers coming into our stores and on our websites really loving the brand. But what's also incredibly exciting on the lower age spectrum is 18 to 34 year olds are increasingly purchasing the HOKA brand. We're starting to hear comments about people are trading their all white Nikes, for all white HOKAs, so that's very encouraging for us as well. And we knew a lot of optimism going into the account \u2013 of Foot Locker account to see what we can do with the younger consumer there too. Thanks, Jon. Yeah, so I'll start with UGG. And then, I'll let Steve tackle the HOKA question. So we're optimistic about UGG in the queue in Q3, as you said, we were late on inventory last year. We potentially missed some sales last year. And the good news is that we have inventory, obviously, in the channel earlier, and we have more inventory coming. So from an inventory standpoint, I think we're going to be in very good shape for Q3. There's just a lot of questions out there still on the consumer level of promotions, et cetera. We're not \u2013 we've in the last couple of years for UGG in Q3, we've been very, very clean, minimal promotions, tight on inventory. We see a little bit of return to normalize season, but we're not expecting or modeling in heavy promotional activity at this point. We want to protect the health of the brand and not chase top-line, because we think we can make up a lot of revenue if we need to, on the year with HOKA. But as far as how the setup looks, we're in inventory position, we have exciting new product launches in the UGG brand, we think are going to resonate very well. And we have a new campaign, a holiday campaign that we're working on right now. So as far as tackling the opportunity, we're in good shape. I think their question is their macroeconomic environment globally, and what that's going to do to not necessarily just the brand, but the wholesale partners, who are tight on inventory as well or heavy on inventory in general. Yeah. Thanks, Sam. Yeah, I'll talk a little bit about HOKA. This is the first global campaign that the brand has ever done. So we felt that it's important to refresh the messaging and the communication from the brand. And, we've obviously evolved our thinking as to what this brand can be for folks globally. And, we've been on a track of inspiring athletes all around the world of all types to get active and be there for them. And so this is a way for us to bring all the different product launches that we go through, whether it's a Clifton, or Bondi, or Speedgoat, to have a little bit more consistency in the look and feel of the campaign to have a consistent tone of voice and to be more consistent with global consumers around the globe. So we're very pleased with how it's been received. We're getting very positive feedback from our wholesale partners. We're getting very positive KPIs on our website. The amount of new visitors for the quarter was up tremendously and very healthy for us, as you see in some of the retention and acquisition figures are all heading in the right direction. And we think this is a foundation and a story that we can continue to build on head to toe and build real power, and an aspirational positioning for the brand. So far, so good. I think we need to add in a little bit more grittiness, if that's the right word into the campaign and pull off some of the great performances and athletes in the UTMB and Western states in Ironman and leverage those influencers a little bit more in the campaign. But we feel the platform is right. The redesign of the website is proven to be very successful so far, our landing page, spend time and dwell time and conversion rates are up. And so we're very pleased. But it's the beginning of a long journey with this campaign. And but so far, we're seeing great adoption globally, and positive reaction from consumers and wholesale accounts. Sure. I'll tackle Foot Locker first. So it's early days, we just put the product in Foot Locker. It's in a handful of position stores that we feel are right for the consumer going after, which is younger, more athletic minded, but still fashion minded consumer in stores that we think the Foot Locker group can represent the brand positively, and then we're online with some styles as well. So too early to share any results, but I will say that, we're pleased with how it's the launch has gone, we're pleased with the feedback we're getting from footlocker. As I mentioned, we're seeing younger consumers, more increasingly adopt the brand. So we feel good about it long-term. So far, so good at the launch, we're going to take our time and maintain the discipline that we always have with expanding distribution, much like we've done with Dick's. But both of those are strategic and reaching consumers where they want to shop in environments that can showcase the brand in a positive way, they're both doing that. And we're going to continue to monitor and see how things go. But there's no major plans to drastically increase door count. We're still in less than 20% of Dick stores. And you can see the results we're getting through our own DTC channels, so very healthy right now. And we'll continue to monitor these and trickle out distribution. Thank you. And I think also, we're hearing a little bit that some of the run specialty accounts are full, in general with not just HOKA inventory, but all their inventory. So there's a limited capacity to be able to bring in additional inventory. But as Steve said, the productivity of HOKA versus others is exceptional, high retail, high margin full price sales. So but we have the inventory now and on the way to be able to manage that channel much better than we have in the last two years. We were really in chase mode. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing on that is we are working on in a more innovative launches. So we're going to bring innovation and new ideas to market faster, and we're going to use a lot utilize that channel to do some tests and learn along the way as well and get some new innovative products out faster, utilizing DTC and the run specialty channel at the beginning of calendar year 2023. Yeah, we are collectively, as ELT as a board and as an organization very excited to have and join the company. She has been here now almost three weeks, she's hit the ground running. She has been a fantastic addition to the ELT. I would say first and foremost, she is the right kind of leader for Deckers. She's an inspirational leader. She's an empathetic leader. She's got incredible experience over her years in Nike, all within merchandising, and storytelling, and brand building. She spent 3 years on the ground in China, redeveloping repositioning that market, and oversaw just a massive business for Nike. And so, the core talent that we love about Anne, she is an exceptional merchant, first and foremost, she understands and appreciates products, she understands how to bring product to market in a compelling way with head to toe storytelling. She knows footwear and apparel. And she's not from the fashion space. But you know, we have a full team of people who are experts in that space. And what we're really looking for here is an inspirational leader who can get the best out of that team. And at the same time, really editing and amplifying our storytelling, which is something a lot of people learned from Nike over the years. So we think just the combination of her leadership and merchandising experience, the global execution that she was overseeing at Nike gives us great leadership for this brand and can unlock the true potential of this brand going beyond the $2 billion that it's at now. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I think for UGG, specifically, we raised prices and about 30% on the line for Q3. So, but in places where we think we can get it, and we've heard that from our wholesale partners that we can get that as well. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, from what I'm hearing,, I wouldn't necessarily say it's caution. But I think wholesalers are filling up on inventory. They've been light, for many of their key brands over the last couple of years. And they're filling up. And logistics is still a challenge for brands and wholesalers. Space is becoming a challenge. And so we're hearing a little bit about that out there in the marketplace, which is why we think it's good that we got inventory in early and we were able to get inventory into the channel to capture that space. So I think it's going to be a dynamic this year that wholesale is going to have to work through as they tried to fill up their inventories and get back in the right position heading into the rest of the year. So we don't see it really affecting our business yet. Demand is still strong, brand health is so strong. We're not hearing you know, about crazy cancellations or anything. It's pretty normalized. So we still feel good about our chances. But that is a dynamic that we're hearing about. All right. Thanks, John. Yeah, so I'll talk about e-commerce a little bit. As you saw from the HOKA results, very healthy quarter for UGG, we did see a lift with the new campaign and the launch, when that kicked in. And so that helped in the back half of the quarter, created a little more excitement, a little more awareness, the first time visitors was in the 70% range. And so, very healthy business has continues to be repeat purchasers, new consumers, younger consumers coming to the site, better KPIs, as I mentioned, on the landing pages and conversion on those pages. So that's really good. And it's broad base, it's across all categories is not really a standout amongst the group. It's just the whole brand is seeing that level of interest in adoption. Within UGG, the real challenge for DTC, as I mentioned is within the slipper category. And, it's a combination of the Fluff business slowing down dramatically from where it was a year ago, still aided by the pandemic. So that's slowed down but we've made up some ground with the Sport Yeah. But it's at a lower price point. So as I mentioned, revenue in DTC was down or e-commerce was down for UGG, but units were up. So I think, as I said, at the point in time dynamic has still think the core business, so I know this core businesses feel strong, heritage slippers still strong, and men still strong. A little softness in kids, but that was also politely related. So aside from that, the brand is still performing on expectation in the categories that we needed to. And as I said, as we get into Q2 and Q3, the Fluff dynamics will be behind us, and it'll be a more normalized business. Thank you."

            "name": "Steven Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just shared our first quarter results demonstrated great progress toward the fiscal year guidance that we outlined in May, while we advanced a number of key initiatives for our business this quarter. HOKA was the primary driver of performance as the brand continues to build global market share. UGG revenue came in slightly lower than last year primarily due to category shifts occurring during the quarter, as well as lapping earlier selling during the prior year. But we feel the brand is well positioned to deliver another strong year and are excited for what lies ahead under Anne's leadership. With ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we're continuing our disciplined and responsible approach to managing our business and will remain nimble to react to this dynamic environment. Our demand signals lead us to believe that our portfolio brands will continue to resonate well with consumers. And though not immune to the macroeconomic headwinds, Deckers has historically demonstrated an ability to course correct when necessary. We remain committed to our long-term strategies that have continued to serve us well, and we'll build upon the strong operating model we have built over the last 5 years. Now, let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2023 results. First quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $614 million, up 22% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 55% versus last year accounting for nearly all of this quarter's revenue growth due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brands global ecosystem of access points, and improved inventory availability. For the first time ever, HOKA represented more than 50% of total portfolio quarterly revenue, and over the last 12 months ended June 30, the brand has delivered over $1 billion of revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was 48%, which is down 360 basis points from last year's 51.6%. This aligned with our first half direction that anticipated headwinds from higher freight costs from ocean and air as well as impacts from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that we anticipate will pressure margins for the remainder of this year. Additionally, first quarter gross margin was impacted by product mix and normalized promotional activity for UGG as the brand sold more sandals and discounted select styles in line with pre-pandemic activity and channel mix shifting towards the wholesale and distributor segment, in particular, our international distributor business that shipped product earlier than in years past. These headwinds were partially offset from benefits from increased revenue mix of HOKA is the brand commanded the highest gross margin in the portfolio during Q1 and benefits from HOKA price increases. SG&A dollar spend in the first quarter was $238 million, which is up 20% from last year's $199 million. As a percentage of revenue, we delivered 60 basis points of leverage to help offset freight and FX impact to gross margin. Our tax rate was 21.3%, which compares to 21.9% in the prior year. These results drove diluted earnings per share of $1.66 for the quarter, which was $0.05 below last year's $1.71 per share. Turning to our balance sheet. At June 30, 2022, we ended June with $695 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $840 million, up 83% versus the same point in time last year. And important to note that last year's inventory levels were below normal operating levels as a result of supply chain disruption and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average share price of $260.12. As of June 30 2022, the company had approximately $354 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1.2 billion on top of the company's existing share repurchase authorization, which now in total represents more than 15% of our market capitalization, highlighting the board's confidence in our long-term strategic plan. Now for supply chain update. Over the last several quarters, we've shared an update on the status of our logistics network and our continued mitigation efforts as we navigate macro supply chain disruption. We are pleased that there have been relative improvement in this area in Q1, but I will share some brief thoughts before I touch on our fiscal year 2023 outlook. Transit times have improved relative to last year, but we are still experiencing latency and lower visibility into the timing of inventory with nearly 40% in transit, and thus are continuing to prioritize holding inventory in the country of sale. For example, during the first quarter inventory generally arrived earlier than anticipated, as a result, we shipped more product out. However, with low visibility into when certain shipments will arrive, we are comfortable holding higher levels of inventory to enable our brands to meet the significant marketplace demand we are seeing. So difficult to predict the timing of when inventory will land, we expect that heightened inventory levels will continue throughout this fiscal year. On the cost front, we are confident that the price increases implemented in the HOKA and UGG brands will offset freight headwinds and help bolster second half margins to deliver our full fiscal year 2023 guidance. Given the earlier arrival of inventory, we now expect to use less air freight than originally anticipated for the HOKA brand. However, as the dollar has continued to strengthen, we are anticipating greater currency headwinds, and this reduction in planned airfreight should help offset these currency pressures. Now, turning to our guidance. And with these dynamics in mind, we are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2023 guidance, which as a reminder includes revenue growth of 10% to 11% versus last year, gross margin 50 basis points higher than last year anticipating approximately 51.5%. SG&A at approximately 34% of revenue and operating margin in the range of 17.5% to 18%; a tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%; and with the share repurchase executed during the first quarter just completed, diluted earnings per share will now be expected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.35, reflecting a $0.10 increase. While we have maintained our overall guidance, I'd like to highlight a few additional items contemplated within the guidance, which include stronger HOKA revenue growth now expected to increase in the 40% range versus last year, reflecting upside from greater inventory availability, which aligns to our expectation of using less air freight than originally anticipated, and incremental foreign currency headwinds, primarily affecting UGG growth due to the brands wholesale business model and concentration of planned growth from the international regions. This reaffirmation of guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include but are not limited to further impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, constraints and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we believe in the power of our brands and continue to see positive signs of consumer demand. Deckers has a history of remaining nimble displaying the unique ability to react as marketplace dynamics evolve, and we are well positioned to deliver compelling revenue growth and top tier operating margins. Thanks, everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yeah, I think, Jon, just to add on to that, as Dave said, order books holding up we're seeing strong demand for the brand so we feel good about that. As we said on inventory, we were going to bring inventory in earlier this year, so kind of on message we're delivering on that. That is contributing to an increase in our inventory levels, which again, just remind everybody at last year's levels were unusually low and below normal operating level. So feel okay with the inventory, where it stands, that will continue to build, but we're well positioned from that standpoint to fulfill the orders that we have. And we're continuing to see consumer response to it. So still very positive on how UGG is performing and the outlook. And then just to remind everybody, we're coming off too strong years of UGG growth. And as we said well documented through last year, it was replenishing depleted levels of inventory in the channel. So we're comping strong growth as well as replenishing inventory and feel comfortable about that. Thank you. Yeah, then Sam on the HOKA question, what we said and kind of indicated in a strong quarter one performance, where we ship more product was increased availability of inventory in June, and that was largely driven by HOKA. And so that gave us an opportunity to ship product more than what we kind of anticipated could happen with the availability of inventory, that was largely HOKA driven, right? And so, I think what you're seeing in the quarter is our ability to get that product into the market a little bit sooner than what we expected, which is always encouraging and will closely watch them sell through. But that's what's driving some of this timing issue. And, again, going back to why we're not giving quarterly guidance. We're just seeing timing, shifting between quarters. And so it's very difficult with what we're dealing with to kind of precisely show when things are going to go. But when we have an opportunity to move product out a little bit earlier than what we anticipated, we're going to take full advantage of it. And that's really what you've seen with HOKA in this quarter. Yeah, I think right now, the way we're kind of looking at things is equivalent between those channels. So, still early and we'll see, but right now, the way we're looking at is kind of equivalent. Yeah. Hi, Laurent, this is Steve. Just on the marketing spend. We \u2013 over the past few years, we have been increasing marketing spend. As it relates to brands, we spend more in marketing on proportional basis to sales on HOKA and we do other brands, and that is part of what's driving our overall market increase and marketing as a percentage of revenue increase. What we're seeing, as Dave just articulated is great productivity with our marketing spend. And what's contributing to building brand awareness, as we talked about quite a bit, HOKA brand awareness is still relatively low in comparison to other brands. And so, with the marketing spend, with the campaigns that we're launching, we're seeing great productivity and how that's driving consumer awareness of the brand and building brand awareness. So it's a lever that we're using very efficiently and productively and will continue to do that. And as you've seen with the global campaign, and as Dave said, we'll continue to refine and continue to build awareness through those campaigns. Yeah. And just on the distribution centers, Laurent, we are, as you mentioned, expanding our presence and space available that is in part to handle the growth that we anticipate with the business and specifically kind of help handle the additional growth in the HOKA business. We do have levers as well. So there \u2013 we have other arrangements in 3PLs that we can change distribution patterns. But we have our main facility in Moreno Valley. We're increasing space in the Midwest, as you mentioned, we also have some distribution through 3PLs on the East Coast that we can also look at. So it's helping us plan for the future. We know these things take time. What I would also say is, we're introducing more automation. And so a big part of what we're developing in the Midwest is an increased automated fulfillment center, so being able to be efficient as we get those up and running efficiently. So more to come on that, but that's how we're looking at that. Right. Yeah, Jim, this is Steve. Good question. We're watching that carefully. And as you mentioned, we are growing our presence and inventory has increased, we are not at some inventory levels, of some of the others, but our productivity is much higher than other brands. So run specialty is highly productive, I think, we're probably the most productive brand in many of those outlets, that's leading to significant turnover of that inventory, so our ability to fulfill it. So, I think, again, as inventory increases, as we have more inventory available, we're going to continue to feed that channel, there's more opportunity, I think, and our teams believe that as well. So we're going to continue to take advantage of that. And now especially with a better inventory position, we're better positioned to continue to go after that business. Yeah, John, this is Steve. We haven't changed anything from what we've said previously. So, we have introduced at the beginning of this calendar year price increases related to HOKA, we're seeing that drive some of the gross margin improvement. Clearly, that's being and has been offset with the higher freight. It's helping mitigate some of the pressures. And we'll continue to face that relate into the next quarter. What we've also said and haven't changed our stance on is price increases on related select product for UGG, that'll really kick in our Q3. Again, that was part of what we indicated on our initial guidance. So we haven't changed anything there. So no change in terms of how we're thinking about price increases, we're going to continue to monitor that. But our prices are pretty well set for the seasons, and would be more a future opportunity, not anything we would expect in this year. Thanks, John. And then, Paul, just a little bit on the inventory, in terms of the in transit percentage wise were a little bit better, but on a higher dollar amounts, so we have higher dollar amounts still in transit. I think that's important to note. And then embedded in that inventory this year versus last year is about $70 million more of additional freight, as rates increased throughout last year. So we're dealing with a significant amount more of freight, embedded in those higher inventory values as well. And then the other with large percentage increase related to HOKA is we're ramping the HOKA inventory to support the growth in that business that's contributing to the higher inventory balance. And just to remind everyone, the average price on a HOKA is greater than the average. So that's contributing to a lift as well. No. We don't. All right. Yeah. Sure, Jay. So this is Steve. So of the 360 basis point decline versus last year in the quarter, roughly 260 of it is increased freight. So that's related to both ocean and air, because we did use some air in Q1, which a year ago, we didn't start using air freight last year until later in the year. So that'll be where we're going to have some headwinds in the first half of the year versus tailwinds when you get into the latter part of the year, so roughly 260 on freight, there's about 50 basis points related to FX and then everything else were kind of all the other things that we stated. Yeah. And just to remind you, the freight again, as we talked about is inclusive of air and ocean. And then the second part of your question was? Yeah, so what we're seeing and this is what's contributed to the strong first quarter. We have seen an improvement, as we mentioned, in the prepared remarks. So product is flowing in a little bit sooner than what we anticipated. So we're seeing things flow. The visibility is still limited, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, too. So we're still trying to get better gauges on arrival of inventory. Good news is, on the West Coast port, labor negotiations, that's still ongoing, so we haven't seen disruption related to that. But again still ongoing, so we'll keep a close eye on that. So again, seen inventory come in better, which is good, gives us an ability like we demonstrated in the quarter with June and with HOKA and ability to move it out and be in a better position than we were a year ago in order to kind of meet some of the demand. So we'll see how things go. We're continuing to work on that continuing to look at ways to improve, but encouraged by some of the improvements that we have seen, but continuing to look for further improvement."

I am thrilled to be here sharing and celebrating Deckers incredible achievements in fiscal year 2024. For the full year, we delivered revenue growth of 18% versus last year, nearly reaching $4.3 billion of annual revenue, gross margin of 55.6%, a 530 basis point increase over last year, operating margin of 21.6%, and earnings per share of $29.16, representing a 51% and nearly $10 increase over last year. These extraordinary results are a testament to the success of our long-term strategies and the execution of our hardworking employees. Over the past four years, Deckers revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 19%, adding over $2 billion of incremental revenue. We also substantially expanded profitability as earnings per share has grown at a CAGR of 32%. With the scale of our organization's growth, we are continuing to bolster our foundation through investments that support the long-term success of our leading brands. HOKA and UGG have become two of the strongest and most in-demand brands in the footwear space. They are continuing to win with consumers by infusing performance and fashion into products that embrace their respective brand codes. Building on the outstanding progress we have made over the last few years, our teams are laser focused on the significant opportunities that lie ahead as we seek to build HOKA into a multi-billion dollar global player in the performance athletic space, grow UGG with premium products and elevated experiences that enhance consumer connections, expand DTC through engagement, acquisition, and retention gains, and advance our international markets through targeted investments. Our robust and innovative product pipeline comprised of relevant and distinct products, is amplified by our marketplace management strategies and gives us the confidence to continue progressing on these initiatives as we create the future of Deckers. Steve will provide further specifics about our fiscal year 2025 expectations, as well as our fiscal year 2024 financial performance, but first I would like to share some of the brand and channel highlights. Starting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 28% versus the prior year. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by increased brand awareness with the US rising to approximately 40% and international regions on average reaching just over 20%. Global DTC which increased 40% versus last year. Market share gains with key global wholesale partners, and most importantly, success with new performance innovations across the road, trail, and lifestyle product categories. From a brand awareness standpoint, these are significant strides for HOKA. Across the board, HOKA is experiencing significant gains on both a season-over-season and a year-over-year standpoint. Aligned with our strategy to solidify HOKA as a global player, international regions are driving particularly strong gains in awareness, increasing more than 80% versus the prior year. Global consumers who identify as runners remain our highest awareness group and continue to see strong increases, but we are also seeing really powerful growth among consumers who are more general fitness oriented. While HOKA is increasing its awareness across all age groups, growth is strongest among 18 to 34 year olds globally, with brand awareness among this influential age group nearly doubling year-over-year. We believe the continued progress introducing HOKA to new consumers around the world has resulted from our increased investments in brand marketing, through the expansion of the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign, including greater out-of-home digital and physical assets, dedicated and enhanced sponsorship of both globally recognized and local running events such as UTMB with HOKA becoming the new title sponsor. Enriched engagement with social media across various platforms, and a greater retail footprint that allows for community building activities like our HOKA Run Club. We are pleased to see these investments paying-off not only through increased awareness across markets, but also by growing brand consideration and purchase intent, some of which is happening in real time. We\u2019re proud of the great progress our teams are making, but also recognize that HOKA still has plenty of room to grow awareness, consideration and ultimately market share across all global regions. HOKA has an amazing opportunity ahead as the brand continues to win with consumers around the world, and we look forward to facing this challenge head on through a relentless focus on product innovation and authentic consumer engagement. From a channel perspective HOKA continues to excel across its ecosystem of global access points. Recall at the outset of fiscal year 2024, we noted the brand's focus on building full price market share, with existing points of wholesale distribution through a pull-model and increasing the mix of DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains. The result of our disciplined marketplace management strategy achieved both goals with HOKA delivering record gross margins as the brand benefited from maintaining exceptionally high levels of full price selling, despite operating in a more promotional marketplace and shifting mix to DTC, which increased to 38%, up from 34% in the prior year. I would also note that the HOKA brand's strong growth through full-price selling in the wholesale channel was accomplished primarily through market share gains with existing distribution, and greater efficiency with recently opened doors relative to locations that were eliminated. Regarding HOKA DTC, revenue growth was driven by global increases in acquired and retained consumers which expanded 32% and 44% respectively. We remain encouraged by the growth across markets, with the US continuing to deliver strong increases in alignment with the global averages and international regions increasing more than 50% in both acquisition and retention. These consumer growth figures are leading indicators of HOKA brand adoption, highlighting the brand's ability to both expand the scope of HOKA consumers and retain existing consumers through consistent product innovations that delivered an unmatched wearing experience. As we continue to introduce HOKA to new consumers around the world. We view branded retail stores in key cities, as an important consumer engagement vehicle. Just a few weeks ago, HOKA opened its second European retail store in Paris, France. Though only open for a short time, we have been very encouraged by the consumer feedback, conversion and broad product adoption. We were excited for HOKA to have a footing in this important market, particularly as the location expect to see high traffic during the upcoming summer Olympics. On the product front, HOKA is driving growth and consumer acquisition through innovative updates and new introductions across a diverse assortment of footwear. The HOKA brand's fiscal year 2024 performance was primarily driven by road running favourites like the Clifton and Bondi franchises, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota, both of which received updates during the year, trail conquers like the Speed Go, Challenger and Stinson franchises and everyday performance lifestyle shoes like the Transport, Solimar and the Kawana. We expect these styles will continue to contribute to the growth of HOKA moving forward, but are also really excited about the brand's ongoing efforts to constantly infuse new innovations into the product assortment. Back in February we highlighted the launch of the all-new Cielo X1, which represents the pinnacle of the HOKA brands race offering. We have been in awe of the consumer response to this incredible shoe, which sold out almost immediately in the initial launch colorway. While we don't expect to drive significant volumes on this very specific ultra performance shoe, we are excited and encouraged by the consumer demand validating HOKA in this category. Our progress in this more niche category is designed to emphasize the brand's performance routes, even as we expand the consumer aperture to more commercial styles. With respect to these broader more commercially focused products, we have been impressed by the consumer response to our latest update of the Mach franchise, the Mach 6. This completely redesigned silhouette was upgraded with a supercritical foam midsole and strategic rubber coverage on the outsole for greater durability, while remaining our lightest Mach to-date. Sell-through of this versatile and responsive style at our wholesale partners and in our DTC channel has been exceptional with the Mach 6 becoming a top five style across all of Deckers since its launch. Innovation is the HOKA brand's top-priority, continuing to develop groundbreaking products that energize consumers around the world. We are fortunate to have a phenomenal roster of HOKA athletes, who we will continue partnering with to drive greater athlete enhanced innovations into our most Pinnacle products, while also further developing the assortment to segment and differentiate HOKA distribution as we continue to scale. The recently launched Skyward X is the perfect example of new product innovation that benefits our segmentation efforts. This all new style was developed as our first carbon plated shoe that is designed for everyday runs with maximum cushion. The Skyward X has a revolutionary suspension system to pair with its convex carbon plate that gives the runner cushion for impact with a natural spring forward. This style helps elevate the HOKA assortment sitting above other Mach\u2019s cushion styles from both a price point and performance perspective. This allows HOKA widen distribution on other styles while the Skyward X is targeted for specific accounts like run specialty, top strategic performance stores and our DTC channel. As we methodically open new access points for HOKA over the next year, we continue to fine-tune differentiated assortments across geographic markets and channels of distribution. I could not be prouder of the HOKA team's incredible results over the last year. We are pleased to now have a proven industry leader like Robin Green, who joined us in February, leading the team and are looking forward to the positive impact we believe she can have to drive HOKA into its next phase of growth. Moving on to UGG. Global revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus the prior year. For the year, UGG growth derived from the key initiatives set forth at the outset of FY '24, as aligned product, marketing and commercial execution, drove global increases in DTC acquisition and retention and expansion in international markets. These results are a testament of our powerful product engine and disciplined product management strategy. The UGG brand continues to maintain important relationships with valued wholesale partners while delivering strong results through the segmentation and differentiation of global marketplaces. With the allocation of core products driving high levels of full price sell-through and lean inventories in the marketplace, UGG has become a leading-brand in wholesale, while funneling upside demand to the DTC channel. For the year this contributed to global gains in both DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 18% and 17% respectively, contributing to the UGG brand's 22% increase in global DTC revenue. This is a truly impressive result for our DTC channel and speaks to the work our brand, marketing and PR teams have been doing to maintain high levels of brand heat year-round from seeding products with global and regional influencers, creating compelling product collaborations with prominent brands and showing up on the runway at fashion weeks around the world to deepening consumer connections through elevated brand experiences like the Field House or a recent Formula 1 activation. The UGG team has consistently developed interesting and on-brand content to stay top of mind with consumers. We believe the continued focus of our teams are working with local individuals across global markets, has helped UGG connect and resonate more effectively with international consumers. Whether it be partnering with Honey from K-PoP Group NewJeans or the collaboration with Gallery Department expanding access to influential retailers in Europe. These efforts have helped establish UGG in its healthiest position to date across influential international markets. This contributed to UGG delivering an international growth rate of more than two that of the double-digit revenue growth from the US market. The success of these initiatives drove significant shifts in the composition of UGG revenue aligned with our long-term strategy with DTC increasing to a record 50% of mix and international increasing to 37% of mix, up from approximately 30% three years ago. Both of these ships were margin accretive and when combined with exceptionally high levels of full price selling and benefits from select price increases, resulted in record high gross margin for the UGG brand in fiscal year 2024. Of course, this is all underpinned by the UGG brand's ongoing creation of compelling products that are resonating around the world. What impresses me most about the UGG brand's performance in fiscal year 2024 is that the brand drove a 16% increase in revenue through single-digit unit growth with significantly fewer SKUs than the prior year. UGG was able to achieve this because of the increased global alignment on the brand product assortment, creating efficiencies on marketing stories and inventory purchasing. Last year, we spoke about the UGG team's focus to reimagine iconic styles and that is exactly what we saw play out during FY'24, and what we continue to see consumer is excited about in the upcoming fiscal year. The UGG product team continues to delight consumers by creating threads that connect new styles to existing icons. Over the last couple of years we've seen this take shape with the Ultra Mini inspired by the Classic Mini, Platform Classics, inspired by the original classics and the Tazz, inspired by the Tasman. These are just a few examples of product evolutions that have helped UGG build the shoulder seasons outside of fall and winter, attracting new consumers while remaining rooted in the brand's heritage. Keeping an eye on the future, UGG continues to build upon franchises that are reimagining of existing icons in new categories. The Golden Collection is one, we continue to be very excited about. UGG first introduced the Goldenstar Sandal a couple of years ago, which is a strappy sandal inspired by the original classic boot. This style has continued to blossom on its own and we are also seeing great enthusiasm for new adjacent styles in the collection, including the Golden Glow sandal, a water-friendly colorful version of the original Goldenstar, which has become an instant hit and the Goldenstar Clog, which was spotted on basketball Superstar, Caitlin Clark, shortly after shoes drafted first overall to the WNBA. Outside of the Golden Collection, UGG is developing compelling new products in the slip-on shoe and sneaker category, which includes the Lowmel, a sneaker silhouette inspired by the original Neumel boot that continues to sell out quickly as new inventory comes into the marketplace and venture days, a rugged outdoor take on the original Tasman, which sold out quickly in China and was recently worn by Formula One Star Pierre Gasly at the Miami Grand Prix. These emerging franchises, along with complementary styles give us confidence that UGG will continue to capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand to deliver strong performance for years to come. Congratulations to the UGG team on another excellent year. Moving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. Deckers' fiscal year 2024 results reflected the success of our omni-channel marketplace management strategies that continue to preserve our brand's premium positioning around the world. By tightly managing marketplace inventory, we were able to drive strong full price sell-through, increase market share and capture upside demand in our direct-to-consumer channel. This led to outstanding DTC growth, which for fiscal year 2024 increased revenue 27% versus last year by adding nearly $400 million of incremental business. DTC represented 43% of total company revenue which is up from 40% in the prior fiscal year. DTC gains resulted from strength across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 40% and 22%, respectively. Regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 37% and 22%, respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 21% and 24% respectively, across all brands. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 25% versus last year, reflecting positive engagement and conversion of demand for the great products that our brands are bringing to market across both online and in-store direct-to-consumer touch points. From a wholesale perspective, fiscal year 2024 revenue increased 13% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by high levels of full-priced global demand for the UGG and HOKA brands, which resulted in healthy sell-throughs at our valued partners, as we maintain lean inventories in the wholesale marketplace. We are entering fiscal year 2025 in a position of strength because of the successful execution of our omni-channel brand and marketplace management strategy. As our brand teams continue to delight consumers with unique and innovative products, our commercial teams will continue to execute on this strategy, working with our fantastic partners to maintain our brand's premium positioning in their respective marketplaces. With that I will hand it over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results, as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2025. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, Deckers' performance in fiscal year 2024 was exceptional as we drove our fourth consecutive year of double-digit top-line growth and delivered top-tier levels of profitability. Deckers has added over $1.1 billion of incremental revenue in two years, driven by the strength of the HOKA and UGG brands, as innovative and consumer obsessed product creation continues to resonate globally. Our flexible operating model and disciplined approach to marketplace management has allowed us to capitalize on these high levels of brand heat, while maintaining exceptional levels of full price selling leading to our record earnings in fiscal year 2024. Our dedication to our long-term strategic initiatives continues to be the foundation for our success, as we remain committed to driving profitable growth over the long term. With that, let's get into a recap of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $960 million, representing an increase of 21% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by HOKA and UGG, which saw increases of 34% and 15% respectively. On HOKA the brand delivered its first ever $0.5 billion quarter, as DTC maintained momentum with volume continuing to grow quarter-over-quarter and wholesale reaccelerated from both a percentage and volume perspective, as the brand benefited from key product launches and the wholesale fill-in activity. For UGG, the brand delivered an exceptional quarter, as DTC was able to maintain momentum from Q3, delivering another strong increase despite some inventory shortages on certain key products and wholesale drove growth versus last year, despite selling significantly fewer units as the brand was able to replace the majority of last year's closeout volume with full price shipments into a depleted marketplace and international strength was maintained. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 56.2%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior year. The improved gross margin primarily relates to extraordinary benefits from higher mix of UGG full price selling, including lower closeouts, select price increases as well as favorable brand and product mix and freight savings. SG&A for the fourth quarter was $395 million, representing 41.2% of revenue, which compares to last year's $290 million and a 36.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 450 basis points year-over-year, primarily as we accelerated top of funnel marketing spend to build longer-term awareness and our strong fiscal 2024 results drove higher performance related compensation. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count from our share repurchase program drove diluted earnings per share of $4.95 which compares to $3.46 in the prior year period, representing a 43% increase. With the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2024 results, which includes revenues increasing 18% versus last year to a record $4.288 billion, as compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by robust HOKA growth across regions and channels led by strong DTC growth of 40% as the brand continues to gain awareness across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and broad-based UGG growth, as the brand grew 16% and eclipsed $2.2 billion of revenue primarily through DTC and international strength. Gross margins for the year were 55.6% up 530 basis points versus last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily related to favorable UGG full price selling freight savings, select pricing benefits, as well as favorable brand and product mix and favorable channel mix with DTC growth outpacing wholesale. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.46 billion up 24% versus the prior year's $1.17 billion. SG&A represented 34% of revenue, which is 170 basis points above last year's rate. The SG&A increase as compared to last year was driven primarily by investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher performance compensation, higher marketing spend including strategic spend to amplify HOKA awareness, in leading international markets, and infrastructure investments and related depreciation to support the continued growth of our organization. This all resulted in a full fiscal year 2024 operating margin of 21.6%, which is 360 basis points above last year, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced partially offset by the normalization of our rate of SG&A spend. As illustrated by our results, we continue delivering top-tier levels of profitability. And while we are pleased with these results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion experienced particularly from historically low levels of promotion and discounting may not repeat to the same degree in future periods. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is flat to last year. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count from share repurchase activity culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $29.16, which represents a 51% increase over last year's $19.37. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2024 we ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $474 million down 11% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately $104 million worth of shares at an average price of $875.01 per share. For the entire fiscal year 2024, we repurchased over 700,000 shares for approximately $415 million at an average per share price of $580.44. At March 31, 2024 the company still had approximately $942 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect top-line revenue growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year to $4.7 billion with HOKA as the main driver of growth increasing approximately 20%, versus the prior year through consumer acquisition and retention gains in our DTC channel, expanding strategically through key partners, while maintaining disciplined marketplace management and maintaining a dedicated focus on growing awareness and market share internationally. UGG increasing mid-single digits, driven primarily by international expansion and managing a healthy US marketplace, which includes prioritizing our DTC channel as we focus on maintaining the brand's pull model. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 53.5%, which is down 210 basis points versus last year, as we are anticipating a more normalized promotional environment with lower full price selling than the exceptional levels achieved in fiscal year 2024 and higher freight costs. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we continue reinforcing our foundation and supporting key growth initiatives, which includes increased levels of marketing spend, primarily related to our continued focus to expand global HOKA awareness, investment in talent to bolster integral teams supporting the growth of our organization and IT and warehouse investments. We expect an operating margin of approximately 19.5%, reflecting our commitment to deliver top-tier levels of profitability while continuing to invest for the long-term growth of our brands. We are projecting an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%, with this all resulting in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $29.50 to $30. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million, which is above last year as we invest in supply chain and warehouse capabilities, capital IT projects retail refreshments, including opening select new strategic locations and updates to office facilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives and delivering towards the full fiscal year. Per normal course, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance. However given we are more than halfway through the first quarter we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth in the high-teens, as we continue to refill depleted channel inventory that is pulling forward demand this year, and HOKA has maintained strong momentum in the DTC channel. Gross margin slightly above the full fiscal year guided rate as we benefit from reduced UGG promotion activity relative to last year in this quarter, select price increases on popular UGG style that we begin to lap in the second quarter and the largest proportion of HOKA revenue contribution. I would additionally note that beyond the first quarter, our gross margin will be up against exceptional levels of full price selling for the UGG brand. And thus, we do not expect the favorability relative to last year to continue beyond Q1. Regarding SG&A, our dollar growth rate in the first quarter is planned significantly higher as we front-load investments to support our growing organization. The higher earlier planned spending is driven by investments in marketing to launch brand campaigns that are further supporting some of the demand shifts we are seeing, as well as some earlier FX remeasurement headwinds resulting from the recent strengthening of the US dollar. Thanks, everyone. And with that, I'll now hand off the call to Dave for his closing remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. I am so proud of the tenacity that our teams have consistently demonstrated to outperform expectations while continuously evolving in a dynamic consumer environment. As I near the end of my tenure leading the Deckers organization, I could not be prouder of how far we have come over the last eight years. Our company has transformed into a leading portfolio of consumer favorite brands. We have experienced explosive growth by incredible and still increasing brand heat across HOKA and UGG. Our organization has proven to be incredibly resilient and we have worked with agility to continuously deliver outstanding results. The company's success is largely attributable to our aligned long-term strategies, our highly effective leaders across the organization and hard-working and caring employees that continue to execute as we transform the business. Deckers is in an excellent position to continue on this path as Stefano steps into the role of CEO in just a few months. He has been a key contributor to our successful transformation and knows what it takes to lead Deckers on this continued journey. He and I are continuing to work together to ensure a smooth transition. Together, we are deeply committed to fostering Deckers collaborative and inspiring culture inclusive of encouraging authenticity, teamwork and a common goal to do good and to do great. This has cultivated a strong and growing team of exceptionally talented long-time employees and critical new hires across our global organization, which are the driving force behind our iconic brands, and I believe we will continue to galvanize the pathway for future success. On behalf of our executive leadership team and Board of Directors, I'd like to once again thank our employees for all their dedication to Deckers values and delivery of yet another full year of record results. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for their continued support along the way. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Hello, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dave, I wanted to ask about HOKA. HOKA DTC was 38% of the mix for the year, which implies 4Q wholesale grew 40%. So I think you mentioned wholesale or maybe Steve, you had mentioned the wholesale fill in what was called out for the quarter. First quarter is also benefiting -- what are you seeing in the wholesale channel? Are retailers reordering across the Board, or may be selective? How should we think about HOKA wholesale growth for the year itself?\nDave Powers: Yes. Good question, Laurent. We're still seeing healthy demand from our wholesale partners. There was a little bit pull forward and sell-throughs are strong, so that kind of pulled forward mentality is still in place. It's right in-line with our pull-forward model. So we keep our wholesale channels tight and we try to drive more revenue to DTC. And we are going to continue that playbook going into 2025 and beyond. Remember, last year we maintained net new doors across wholesale. So in the wholesale channel. In FY '25, we'll be opening select doors with select strategic partners, more focused on our international marketplace. But we still have opportunity in international run specialty. In US run specialty, we are regularly generally one or two in market share. So just still optimizing that channel, but we have room to grow in our international strategic [run-mark] (ph) partners as well. So, yes. The marketplace is still strong. The demand is out there from the consumer, we're upgrading our pull model. And in addition to that, we have DTC, which we are expecting to grow faster than wholesale as we try to bolster that business and we get more interest in the brand from awareness increasing globally, which will help drive that model as well. Stefano, do you want to add anything there?\nStefano Caroti: Yes, Laurent, to build on what Dave just said, sales has been strong. Our key innovation stories for the season have performed very well. [indiscernible] not huge volumes there, but has performed super, super well beyond our expectations. And Mach 6, has performed -- and is performing very, very well, and it's now a top three style not just for HOKA for Deckers. In Skyward X, which we just launched a couple of weeks ago, the early read is also very, very, very encouraging across the globe.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That's great to hear, Stefano. And then on HOKA International, I think you called it out Dave, the $1.8 billion in sales, is it fair to assume that HOKA International is about 30% of the mix. And if that is the case, where do you think that goes this year over time? And what region are you most excited about for FY '25?\nDave Powers: Yes, you're right. It's roughly around 30%. We do see that creeping up over time. We haven't given hard targets on that, but we are going to be focusing more energy on building awareness. As I said, door expansion, bolstering up our DTC engines in those markets. From a volume perspective, you'll definitely see upside in Europe. China is still a small market for us with tremendous upside and a lot of exciting things going on there. But from a dollar percentage increase, it's still going to be led by Europe in the short-term. I was in Asia last week together with Rob and Anne and the two leadership teams, there's definitely significant potential for both brands in China and the rest of Asia.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Wonderful. Thank you very much for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. I just want to ask about your guiding to mid-single-digit growth for this year on top of, obviously a really big year last year. What gives you the confidence that UGG continue to build on the big growth you've seen not just last year over the last couple of years as we think about fiscal 2025? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. I've been here now coming up on 12 years. And this is the healthy effect seen the UGG brand. The demand with the consumer, the 18 to 24 year-old consumer, the broad-based health of all of our channels, retail stores, e-commerce sites, wholesale partners globally. And essentially, what you're seeing is the marketplace pull model that we put in place in North America a few years ago. Now that's activated in our international regions. So you're seeing brand heat and consideration among consumers in new international markets, increasing and very strong, and our pull model is still working. So we like to keep things a little bit scarce. And that led to some of the success we saw in this past Q4 where people were still looking for some of our reimagined icons like the Taaz and the Ultra Mini. Normally, we would see those tail-off at the beginning of January and February, but those are still strong and starting to become year-round styles. The other significant thing last year, we -- we sold low single-digits growth in units, but 18% revenue sales on top of that. So we are seeing a very healthy full price business. There is less markdown, there is less assortment in the channel. So we have the right styles for the right consumer in the right locations. And then we are also seeing great success in new franchises like the Goldenstar and venture days. And so that, combined with just the brand heat, the health of the marketplace, the way that the consumer is reacting to our localized marketing activations and our store elevation, we see a lot of optimism for the UGG brand going forward. But you are going to see continued growth in DTC and a real focus on upside in international.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, Jay, this is Steve. Just to kind of add on to that. And I think it's important and Dave touched on it here. But what we saw in FY '24 was fairly significant dollar increase and not so much on the unit side. So because we benefited from full price selling, less close out some of our channel mix, that drove a big proportion of the dollar increase. And while we had some unit increases, what gives us confidence going forward in that mid-single-digit guidance is that we're continuing to see more and more consumers engage in the brand. So demand continues to increase. And so we won't necessarily -- in the guidance we gave, we are expecting that kind of same level of gross margin. But what we do see is with the demand that's out there right, and some of what we delivered in Q4, the consumer response to the product that Dave mentioned, just be continued to see in the marketplace around the UGG brand. And that's what's giving us confidence going forward.\nJay Sole: Got it. That makes sense. If I can follow up on that. Can you just maybe dimensionalize a little bit and help us understand how UGG is growing by telling us sort of how you think about growth of sort of the classics versus all the -- what I would call the relatively new stuff since the last few years or so. How do you see the growth rates in those two? But how is that driving the UGG brand?\nDave Powers: Yes. Classics, it is funny to ask that because it used to be all of our conversations and the majority of our business. And we've been able to just maintain that as a steady, healthy premium well-positioned part of our business, roughly around 25%, 30%, steady sell-through steady margin, good handle on inventory and flow -- where we're seeing the exciting thing -- the excitement come from is all these reimagine classics that we're talking about. So iteration of the Tasman, iterations of the Lowmel, the Ultra Mini the Ultra platform. Those styles are broad-based. They are resonating extremely well with younger consumers. They're showing up on influencers in a very powerful way. And then we have a men's business that is starting to show some signs of excitement as well in similar styles. So -- that's really where the growth is being driven from. And we have an incredible pipeline of product that evolves these styles over the next 18, 24 months that I think is just a phenomenal assortment, some of the most exciting product in the market. And then we're also innovating around hybrid slipper-sandal models with increased comfort under foot that I think are going to be really well received. So I think, Anne and the team have done a great job on editing the assortment, getting us out of styles that are met to really focusing on our UGG DNA across any styles that we do. And then a really powerful PR and social media engine to drive it all. And so this is a brand that's in a great place right now. It's very healthy. And we believe that this brand has room to grow and continue at this pace.\nJay Sole: Got, it. Thank you so much.\nDave Powers: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Congrats on a phenomenal year. Thank you for taking my question. Stefano great to hear your voice. Just curious how you're thinking about UGG and HOKA, the international opportunity, both from a top-line perspective channel perspective? And then also how the margin profile of the business internationally can evolve? Thank you.\nStefano Caroti: Yes, of course, John. Our business currently is two-thirds US and one-third international, as you know. And the one-third of international, 50% comes from Europe, roughly 35% comes from Asia Pacific and the balance is Canada and Latin America. Clearly, we see a lot of opportunity internationally. And while we expect the US to continue to grow, long term, we would want international to grow faster. We are -- as you heard from Dave, in terms of brand awareness, we are well behind where we are in the US for Hoka and roughly 20 points behind. So we've been investing more, we've been investing faster internationally to accelerate that growth. And also in terms of distribution, we intend to selectively expand our distribution with key partners while carefully monitoring the productivity of the doors we expanded. So there's definitely a lot of upside for us internationally, both in terms of top line as well as margin.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And then, John, just -- this is Steve. On the margin question, we really -- we look at the business and clearly, what we experienced in FY'24 was extraordinary with gross margin expansion. And as you've seen in what we have guided, we don't necessarily expect all of that same benefit in FY '25. So on a comparable basis, as we look at it, continued performance of strong margins, likely moving back to a more normalized level, as we've indicated in our guidance. But generally, no significant change in margins that we're achieving as we're kind of moving into a more normalized environment.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Extraordinary is a good word here to use. I guess the other extra thing the DTC segment contribution margin has skyrocketed the last several years. It's -- I think it's over 900 basis higher than wholesale now. Where do you think the profitability -- is it sustainable at the high 30% level at DTC? And do you expect this continued margin mix shift to continue for the direct-to-consumer channel?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Again, we benefited in all channels with what we saw in FY '24. And so clearly, with some normalization, a bit of a setback. But again, it's still delivering even in a normalized mode exceptional levels of profitability. So the way we're seeing the profile or the framework, not significant change again as we normalize. But as Stefano indicated and Dave has indicated, we're always looking at how we can drive a higher proportion of our DTC business, which overall does have a positive accretive impact on the business. Now it doesn't happen overnight, right? And so with some of the wholesale expansion that we our forecasting in FY '25, that does take some of the growth. So the other thing that we benefited from was a bit of a step-up in our proportion of DTC business in '24 versus '23, and that's because we were running the scarcity model in wholesale. And so we were able to fuel more of that demand over into the DTC channel. That fueled some of our gross margin expansion as we open up a little bit more wholesale in FY '25, again being very strategic and thoughtful about it. That will put some pressure on the DTC growth. But as Dave said, we're still looking to move a higher proportion to DTC, but it won't necessarily be the same step function that you saw in FY '24.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Well, congrats on a phenomenal year, Dave, best of luck, and I'll turn it over.\nDave Powers: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Well, thank you for taking my question. And Let's do it, and then we can go on to the other stuff out of the way.\nErinn Kohler: Sam. So what I'll provide for you, I think you're asking about the full year -- I'll give you a full year --.\nSam Poser: For the quarter. Could you just give us Q4 just so really clear on either wholesale or DTC by brand to come back into the other part of it?\nErinn Kohler: Sure, I can give you fourth quarter. So fourth quarter fiscal '24 that we just completed. So this is going to be a global wholesale and distributor combined by brand. For UGG was about $139 million. For HOKA was about $350 million. For Teva, $46 million, Sanuk about $5 million that you get the other.\nSam Poser: Okay. Thank you. All right. Dave, congratulations, first of all, on -- as you go to the beach and the sunset leaving, lots of sand behind. And -- so let us talk about UGG. You delivered a lot of product early last year, it did exceptionally well both in the store -- both in your own DTC and at your wholesale accounts. And then most retailers and yourselves were basically sold out come Thanksgiving. So that leaves a monster upside, still potentially leaving a lot of demand on the table in December. What -- how do we think about that especially that month of December that all -- everybody was looking at the numbers going. There is no business being done, but there was no inventory in the market. So could you tell us how this mid-single digit works when it looks like you have a ton of white space and arguably one of the largest consumer -- direct-to-consumer volume months of the year?\nDave Powers: Yes. I think what we're experiencing now and you start in fourth quarter is a lot of that demand that we missed in December came to us in Q4. And so when we got back in stock in some of those styles, people still wanted them. And so they were buying them in January, February, March and still are. So I wouldn't say that we missed whatever opportunity we missed in December, it's all lost. We did fulfill some of that demand over the last three to four months. That being said yes, there's opportunity this year. We are excited about the assortment. And I also mentioned, we think we can maintain high levels of full price sales. But it is still going to be a challenging environment out there. I think, that the way we are pegging the business with the assortment, we don't have any necessarily any new price increases this year. And I think, maintaining a tight rein on wholesale and driving it to DTC, I think that's about right, the way we pegged it and the way we're looking at the business going into it now.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. I think also, Sam, this is Steve. Just on that, too, the other consideration is we did expedite product in Q3, and that sold through on DTC, so through e-commerce. This year, we are going to be expanding some of the amount that wholesale is ordering. Again we'll be very careful and strategic about it. But that will put some of the pressure on the DTC growth right? And so again, going back to my earlier answer to one of the previous questions, a big piece of the revenue beat on UGG was this full price selling channel mix shift. And so you're not necessarily going to have that same benefit in FY '25 that we had in '24.\nDave Powers: Comping an 18% growth, there is no cakewalk.\nSam Poser: No, I appreciate that, but I have seen some of the fall product. It looks pretty -- you've got a few things up your sleeve there that could do a lot more than what you anticipated. Let me just ask you this, at the beginning -- you beat your -- the high end of initial revenue guidance by 8.5%. You beat your EPS go -- your initial EPS guidance by 35% would be a gross margin by 310 and you beat your EBIT margin by 300 basis -- 360 basis points based on what your initial guidance was last year. Is there -- are you guiding this year sort of relatively differently? Are you looking at the world the same way? Are you looking at it differently than you did a year ago at this time?\nSteve Fasching: Yes. Sam, I think the way we are looking at it is we're not going to get the same benefits in FY '25 that we got in '24. Again so that -- the difference between the revenue change and the unit change is 1 that's really important to understand because what we benefited from in '24 was full-price selling, combined with price increases combined with running a scarcity model that drove more traffic into DTC. So we won't have the same level of benefit on price increases in FY '25 that we had in '24. We'll see what the promotional environment looks like that's always a hard one to determine, especially in the current environment, a lot of uncertainty you are hearing what some other companies are saying. So that's one that we will continue to carefully watch. We're being served well with kind of a controlled marketplace. So we'll continue to look at it. But I don't think the setup to your point, is the same. I think there were more factors that we knew we could benefit from in '24 than in '25, but again we'll manage through '25 and we'll see how it turns on.\nSam Poser: Thank you guys, very much and continued success and good luck as you walk off into the sunset.\nDave Powers: Thanks Sam. I will miss you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Janine Stichter with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, good afternoon, congratulation on the really strong year. To start out a question on HOKA. You mentioned seeing awareness from non-runner everyday athletes and more casual styles. So how do you think about just further segmenting the assortment and the distribution decade to this consumer while still keeping your heritage. And then one for Steve, on SG&A. You're flipping to basically a flat SG&A rate this year after a year of deleverage. Just how to think about where you are in that reinvestment cycle. I know you've been saying a little bit of catch-up on SG&A. And if you do see upside to your revenue guide on revenues, how do you think about further reinvestment in here? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thanks, Janine. On the consumer breadth of HOKA, it is pretty exciting, right? And one thing I can guarantee you that we will always prioritize our performance business first. And so we are \u2013 there is no doubt, we are a performance innovation-driven company. And that's going to be our priority. We'll always prioritize the specialty run accounts. We will always prioritize that -- the hard core running and trail-running consumer. But we obviously have been adopted in a pretty substantial way from a lifestyle perspective. And that's because of the performance that's built into the product. It's not just that they look good, but they feel good. And now they become something that these consumers they not only want the product, they need the product. They need the next color. They need the next version of the Bondi or the Clifton, the Arahi and now the Mach. So that will just expand over time. As we segment the line over time. I mean, as you know, we've been doing this from day one is innovation that's appropriate to the channel segmenting by channel and consumer, particularly as we get into DICK's and JD and Foot Locker and [broader doors] (ph). And there is -- I also believe there's just a generalized trend out there that running is kind of becoming the new streetwear. Those looks are adopted by more consumers now than they ever have been, and we see that continuing. And we welcome those consumers into the brand, but they will be buying performance product from us not lifestyle design product.\nSteve Fasching: And then, Janine, just on the SG&A. So I think in terms of where we landed FY '24, the 34% spend to revenue and the guide equivalent for FY '25, we think that kind of the appropriate level, we'll see. It is increasing from where we have been in the past couple of years as we've made investments and continue to make investments, and I called it out in the script in terms of building talent, infrastructure, distribution. So as we are growing and continue to grow at a slightly faster pace than what we anticipated, there is still a bit of a catch-up that you're seeing. I think as we continue to look at the year, we'll manage accordingly. I think that has served us well. We haven't gotten ahead of the growth, but we're carefully monitoring to keep pace with it. And that's some of the increases that you've seen really over the last couple of years.\nJanine Stichter: Great. Thanks so much. That\u2019s really helpful and best of luck.\nSteve Fasching : Thanks Janine.\nOperator: Our last question for today comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Hi, thank you good afternoon. I wanted to ask about HOKA. If I could just ask a near-term question. It looks like D2C was up in the low 20s in the fourth quarter year-over-year, and you're assuming D2C outgrows for fiscal 2025. So are you assuming a little bit of a reacceleration? And if so, could you maybe talk about the drivers? And -- when you think about the product launch strategy for HOKA this year, could you just give insight to some of the shifts there. I know we haven't seen the next version of a few of your key icons or your biggest styles like Clifton and Bondi so just how should we think about the product launch cadence or cycle?\nDave Powers: Yes, I'll tackle with Steve, the DTC versus wholesale. Generally, yes, we will see a slight increase in the rate of DTC growth the way we are looking at it, and that contemplates a little bit lower wholesale, but it is not dramatic on one end or the other. But as we -- as our awareness increases, as we have more international distribution, opening select retail stores, that does drive more traffic and a healthy business to our DTC channel. We convert at a very high rate when people come to our website. And then we have just a growing repeat business from our existing customer base, and the new launch cadence, as you mentioned, brings eyeballs to the site as well. So we are -- and that's by design, we're strategically trying to grow DTC a little bit faster over time because we know that's good for us long term, good for margins, good for health of the marketplace, and that pull model is working extremely well. So you'll see this year that we've modeled it out a little bit better in DTC than wholesale, but on a regional basis, wholesale will be very strong, too.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And what I would add, John, just to that is just to be careful about kind of relying too much on a quarter performance. We are managing this for the long run. So again when you have depleted inventory in the channel, that might impact your wholesale growth in one quarter as you're refilling that. It's not necessarily indicative of the longer-term views, back to Dave's point, as we look at growth, clearly, our focus is on trying to grow DTC faster, which is kind of what we are doing and growing the proportion of that. I wouldn't rely too much just on one quarter, or a dynamic in that quarter because there are other factors that affect the short-term, but we're looking at the long-term.\nDave Powers: Yes, I think that's a really good point to keep in mind. We are not in a consistent model of new introductions of products and drops, right? It's been changing a little bit year-over-year. We're starting to formalize that a little bit more. But sometimes when you see a drop in sales, say, credit card data, you got to look at what's in the market, when do we drop things? What were we selling last year full price versus markdown? And -- that's why I think if you look at the long view of the year when we have multiple drops over the year, our innovation engine and the pipeline hits the marketplace, it's best to look at that over a 12 months to 18 months period versus three months because there's so many puts and takes from new introductions this year, last year, markdowns, et cetera. So I think Steve is spot on that point.\nStefano Caroti: Yes. And two new products, John, we have a couple of big programs hitting the market same fall and early next year. Speedgoat is our biggest trail franchise, a new Speedgoat 6 with the market in June. Skyflow is a new run specialty exclusive and DTC exclusive that it's going to hit the market in July. That's a sizable program for us. And Bondi, which is our second biggest show, we'll hit Q4 next year, an updated Bondi and the shoe looks fantastic. I'm very excited about how it's been received by our partners.\nJonathan Komp: That's great. Thanks for all the color. And Dave, best of luck. Thanks again.\nDave Powers: Thanks Jonathan, Take care, man.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am thrilled to be here sharing and celebrating Deckers incredible achievements in fiscal year 2024. For the full year, we delivered revenue growth of 18% versus last year, nearly reaching $4.3 billion of annual revenue, gross margin of 55.6%, a 530 basis point increase over last year, operating margin of 21.6%, and earnings per share of $29.16, representing a 51% and nearly $10 increase over last year. These extraordinary results are a testament to the success of our long-term strategies and the execution of our hardworking employees. Over the past four years, Deckers revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 19%, adding over $2 billion of incremental revenue. We also substantially expanded profitability as earnings per share has grown at a CAGR of 32%. With the scale of our organization's growth, we are continuing to bolster our foundation through investments that support the long-term success of our leading brands. HOKA and UGG have become two of the strongest and most in-demand brands in the footwear space. They are continuing to win with consumers by infusing performance and fashion into products that embrace their respective brand codes. Building on the outstanding progress we have made over the last few years, our teams are laser focused on the significant opportunities that lie ahead as we seek to build HOKA into a multi-billion dollar global player in the performance athletic space, grow UGG with premium products and elevated experiences that enhance consumer connections, expand DTC through engagement, acquisition, and retention gains, and advance our international markets through targeted investments. Our robust and innovative product pipeline comprised of relevant and distinct products, is amplified by our marketplace management strategies and gives us the confidence to continue progressing on these initiatives as we create the future of Deckers. Steve will provide further specifics about our fiscal year 2025 expectations, as well as our fiscal year 2024 financial performance, but first I would like to share some of the brand and channel highlights. Starting with the brand highlights. Global HOKA revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 28% versus the prior year. For the year, HOKA growth was driven by increased brand awareness with the US rising to approximately 40% and international regions on average reaching just over 20%. Global DTC which increased 40% versus last year. Market share gains with key global wholesale partners, and most importantly, success with new performance innovations across the road, trail, and lifestyle product categories. From a brand awareness standpoint, these are significant strides for HOKA. Across the board, HOKA is experiencing significant gains on both a season-over-season and a year-over-year standpoint. Aligned with our strategy to solidify HOKA as a global player, international regions are driving particularly strong gains in awareness, increasing more than 80% versus the prior year. Global consumers who identify as runners remain our highest awareness group and continue to see strong increases, but we are also seeing really powerful growth among consumers who are more general fitness oriented. While HOKA is increasing its awareness across all age groups, growth is strongest among 18 to 34 year olds globally, with brand awareness among this influential age group nearly doubling year-over-year. We believe the continued progress introducing HOKA to new consumers around the world has resulted from our increased investments in brand marketing, through the expansion of the FLY HUMAN FLY campaign, including greater out-of-home digital and physical assets, dedicated and enhanced sponsorship of both globally recognized and local running events such as UTMB with HOKA becoming the new title sponsor. Enriched engagement with social media across various platforms, and a greater retail footprint that allows for community building activities like our HOKA Run Club. We are pleased to see these investments paying-off not only through increased awareness across markets, but also by growing brand consideration and purchase intent, some of which is happening in real time. We're proud of the great progress our teams are making, but also recognize that HOKA still has plenty of room to grow awareness, consideration and ultimately market share across all global regions. HOKA has an amazing opportunity ahead as the brand continues to win with consumers around the world, and we look forward to facing this challenge head on through a relentless focus on product innovation and authentic consumer engagement. From a channel perspective HOKA continues to excel across its ecosystem of global access points. Recall at the outset of fiscal year 2024, we noted the brand's focus on building full price market share, with existing points of wholesale distribution through a pull-model and increasing the mix of DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains. The result of our disciplined marketplace management strategy achieved both goals with HOKA delivering record gross margins as the brand benefited from maintaining exceptionally high levels of full price selling, despite operating in a more promotional marketplace and shifting mix to DTC, which increased to 38%, up from 34% in the prior year. I would also note that the HOKA brand's strong growth through full-price selling in the wholesale channel was accomplished primarily through market share gains with existing distribution, and greater efficiency with recently opened doors relative to locations that were eliminated. Regarding HOKA DTC, revenue growth was driven by global increases in acquired and retained consumers which expanded 32% and 44% respectively. We remain encouraged by the growth across markets, with the US continuing to deliver strong increases in alignment with the global averages and international regions increasing more than 50% in both acquisition and retention. These consumer growth figures are leading indicators of HOKA brand adoption, highlighting the brand's ability to both expand the scope of HOKA consumers and retain existing consumers through consistent product innovations that delivered an unmatched wearing experience. As we continue to introduce HOKA to new consumers around the world. We view branded retail stores in key cities, as an important consumer engagement vehicle. Just a few weeks ago, HOKA opened its second European retail store in Paris, France. Though only open for a short time, we have been very encouraged by the consumer feedback, conversion and broad product adoption. We were excited for HOKA to have a footing in this important market, particularly as the location expect to see high traffic during the upcoming summer Olympics. On the product front, HOKA is driving growth and consumer acquisition through innovative updates and new introductions across a diverse assortment of footwear. The HOKA brand's fiscal year 2024 performance was primarily driven by road running favourites like the Clifton and Bondi franchises, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota, both of which received updates during the year, trail conquers like the Speed Go, Challenger and Stinson franchises and everyday performance lifestyle shoes like the Transport, Solimar and the Kawana. We expect these styles will continue to contribute to the growth of HOKA moving forward, but are also really excited about the brand's ongoing efforts to constantly infuse new innovations into the product assortment. Back in February we highlighted the launch of the all-new Cielo X1, which represents the pinnacle of the HOKA brands race offering. We have been in awe of the consumer response to this incredible shoe, which sold out almost immediately in the initial launch colorway. While we don't expect to drive significant volumes on this very specific ultra performance shoe, we are excited and encouraged by the consumer demand validating HOKA in this category. Our progress in this more niche category is designed to emphasize the brand's performance routes, even as we expand the consumer aperture to more commercial styles. With respect to these broader more commercially focused products, we have been impressed by the consumer response to our latest update of the Mach franchise, the Mach 6. This completely redesigned silhouette was upgraded with a supercritical foam midsole and strategic rubber coverage on the outsole for greater durability, while remaining our lightest Mach to-date. Sell-through of this versatile and responsive style at our wholesale partners and in our DTC channel has been exceptional with the Mach 6 becoming a top five style across all of Deckers since its launch. Innovation is the HOKA brand's top-priority, continuing to develop groundbreaking products that energize consumers around the world. We are fortunate to have a phenomenal roster of HOKA athletes, who we will continue partnering with to drive greater athlete enhanced innovations into our most Pinnacle products, while also further developing the assortment to segment and differentiate HOKA distribution as we continue to scale. The recently launched Skyward X is the perfect example of new product innovation that benefits our segmentation efforts. This all new style was developed as our first carbon plated shoe that is designed for everyday runs with maximum cushion. The Skyward X has a revolutionary suspension system to pair with its convex carbon plate that gives the runner cushion for impact with a natural spring forward. This style helps elevate the HOKA assortment sitting above other Mach's cushion styles from both a price point and performance perspective. This allows HOKA widen distribution on other styles while the Skyward X is targeted for specific accounts like run specialty, top strategic performance stores and our DTC channel. As we methodically open new access points for HOKA over the next year, we continue to fine-tune differentiated assortments across geographic markets and channels of distribution. I could not be prouder of the HOKA team's incredible results over the last year. We are pleased to now have a proven industry leader like Robin Green, who joined us in February, leading the team and are looking forward to the positive impact we believe she can have to drive HOKA into its next phase of growth. Moving on to UGG. Global revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus the prior year. For the year, UGG growth derived from the key initiatives set forth at the outset of FY '24, as aligned product, marketing and commercial execution, drove global increases in DTC acquisition and retention and expansion in international markets. These results are a testament of our powerful product engine and disciplined product management strategy. The UGG brand continues to maintain important relationships with valued wholesale partners while delivering strong results through the segmentation and differentiation of global marketplaces. With the allocation of core products driving high levels of full price sell-through and lean inventories in the marketplace, UGG has become a leading-brand in wholesale, while funneling upside demand to the DTC channel. For the year this contributed to global gains in both DTC acquisition and retention, which increased 18% and 17% respectively, contributing to the UGG brand's 22% increase in global DTC revenue. This is a truly impressive result for our DTC channel and speaks to the work our brand, marketing and PR teams have been doing to maintain high levels of brand heat year-round from seeding products with global and regional influencers, creating compelling product collaborations with prominent brands and showing up on the runway at fashion weeks around the world to deepening consumer connections through elevated brand experiences like the Field House or a recent Formula 1 activation. The UGG team has consistently developed interesting and on-brand content to stay top of mind with consumers. We believe the continued focus of our teams are working with local individuals across global markets, has helped UGG connect and resonate more effectively with international consumers. Whether it be partnering with Honey from K-PoP Group NewJeans or the collaboration with Gallery Department expanding access to influential retailers in Europe. These efforts have helped establish UGG in its healthiest position to date across influential international markets. This contributed to UGG delivering an international growth rate of more than two that of the double-digit revenue growth from the US market. The success of these initiatives drove significant shifts in the composition of UGG revenue aligned with our long-term strategy with DTC increasing to a record 50% of mix and international increasing to 37% of mix, up from approximately 30% three years ago. Both of these ships were margin accretive and when combined with exceptionally high levels of full price selling and benefits from select price increases, resulted in record high gross margin for the UGG brand in fiscal year 2024. Of course, this is all underpinned by the UGG brand's ongoing creation of compelling products that are resonating around the world. What impresses me most about the UGG brand's performance in fiscal year 2024 is that the brand drove a 16% increase in revenue through single-digit unit growth with significantly fewer SKUs than the prior year. UGG was able to achieve this because of the increased global alignment on the brand product assortment, creating efficiencies on marketing stories and inventory purchasing. Last year, we spoke about the UGG team's focus to reimagine iconic styles and that is exactly what we saw play out during FY'24, and what we continue to see consumer is excited about in the upcoming fiscal year. The UGG product team continues to delight consumers by creating threads that connect new styles to existing icons. Over the last couple of years we've seen this take shape with the Ultra Mini inspired by the Classic Mini, Platform Classics, inspired by the original classics and the Tazz, inspired by the Tasman. These are just a few examples of product evolutions that have helped UGG build the shoulder seasons outside of fall and winter, attracting new consumers while remaining rooted in the brand's heritage. Keeping an eye on the future, UGG continues to build upon franchises that are reimagining of existing icons in new categories. The Golden Collection is one, we continue to be very excited about. UGG first introduced the Goldenstar Sandal a couple of years ago, which is a strappy sandal inspired by the original classic boot. This style has continued to blossom on its own and we are also seeing great enthusiasm for new adjacent styles in the collection, including the Golden Glow sandal, a water-friendly colorful version of the original Goldenstar, which has become an instant hit and the Goldenstar Clog, which was spotted on basketball Superstar, Caitlin Clark, shortly after shoes drafted first overall to the WNBA. Outside of the Golden Collection, UGG is developing compelling new products in the slip-on shoe and sneaker category, which includes the Lowmel, a sneaker silhouette inspired by the original Neumel boot that continues to sell out quickly as new inventory comes into the marketplace and venture days, a rugged outdoor take on the original Tasman, which sold out quickly in China and was recently worn by Formula One Star Pierre Gasly at the Miami Grand Prix. These emerging franchises, along with complementary styles give us confidence that UGG will continue to capitalize on high levels of brand heat and demand to deliver strong performance for years to come. Congratulations to the UGG team on another excellent year. Moving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. Deckers' fiscal year 2024 results reflected the success of our omni-channel marketplace management strategies that continue to preserve our brand's premium positioning around the world. By tightly managing marketplace inventory, we were able to drive strong full price sell-through, increase market share and capture upside demand in our direct-to-consumer channel. This led to outstanding DTC growth, which for fiscal year 2024 increased revenue 27% versus last year by adding nearly $400 million of incremental business. DTC represented 43% of total company revenue which is up from 40% in the prior fiscal year. DTC gains resulted from strength across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 40% and 22%, respectively. Regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 37% and 22%, respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 21% and 24% respectively, across all brands. On a DTC comparable basis, revenue increased 25% versus last year, reflecting positive engagement and conversion of demand for the great products that our brands are bringing to market across both online and in-store direct-to-consumer touch points. From a wholesale perspective, fiscal year 2024 revenue increased 13% versus last year. Growth was primarily driven by high levels of full-priced global demand for the UGG and HOKA brands, which resulted in healthy sell-throughs at our valued partners, as we maintain lean inventories in the wholesale marketplace. We are entering fiscal year 2025 in a position of strength because of the successful execution of our omni-channel brand and marketplace management strategy. As our brand teams continue to delight consumers with unique and innovative products, our commercial teams will continue to execute on this strategy, working with our fantastic partners to maintain our brand's premium positioning in their respective marketplaces. With that I will hand it over to Steve to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results, as well as our initial outlook on fiscal year 2025. Steve? Thanks, Steve. I am so proud of the tenacity that our teams have consistently demonstrated to outperform expectations while continuously evolving in a dynamic consumer environment. As I near the end of my tenure leading the Deckers organization, I could not be prouder of how far we have come over the last eight years. Our company has transformed into a leading portfolio of consumer favorite brands. We have experienced explosive growth by incredible and still increasing brand heat across HOKA and UGG. Our organization has proven to be incredibly resilient and we have worked with agility to continuously deliver outstanding results. The company's success is largely attributable to our aligned long-term strategies, our highly effective leaders across the organization and hard-working and caring employees that continue to execute as we transform the business. Deckers is in an excellent position to continue on this path as Stefano steps into the role of CEO in just a few months. He has been a key contributor to our successful transformation and knows what it takes to lead Deckers on this continued journey. He and I are continuing to work together to ensure a smooth transition. Together, we are deeply committed to fostering Deckers collaborative and inspiring culture inclusive of encouraging authenticity, teamwork and a common goal to do good and to do great. This has cultivated a strong and growing team of exceptionally talented long-time employees and critical new hires across our global organization, which are the driving force behind our iconic brands, and I believe we will continue to galvanize the pathway for future success. On behalf of our executive leadership team and Board of Directors, I'd like to once again thank our employees for all their dedication to Deckers values and delivery of yet another full year of record results. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for their continued support along the way. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes. Good question, Laurent. We're still seeing healthy demand from our wholesale partners. There was a little bit pull forward and sell-throughs are strong, so that kind of pulled forward mentality is still in place. It's right in-line with our pull-forward model. So we keep our wholesale channels tight and we try to drive more revenue to DTC. And we are going to continue that playbook going into 2025 and beyond. Remember, last year we maintained net new doors across wholesale. So in the wholesale channel. In FY '25, we'll be opening select doors with select strategic partners, more focused on our international marketplace. But we still have opportunity in international run specialty. In US run specialty, we are regularly generally one or two in market share. So just still optimizing that channel, but we have room to grow in our international strategic [run-mark] (ph) partners as well. So, yes. The marketplace is still strong. The demand is out there from the consumer, we're upgrading our pull model. And in addition to that, we have DTC, which we are expecting to grow faster than wholesale as we try to bolster that business and we get more interest in the brand from awareness increasing globally, which will help drive that model as well. Stefano, do you want to add anything there? Yes, you're right. It's roughly around 30%. We do see that creeping up over time. We haven't given hard targets on that, but we are going to be focusing more energy on building awareness. As I said, door expansion, bolstering up our DTC engines in those markets. From a volume perspective, you'll definitely see upside in Europe. China is still a small market for us with tremendous upside and a lot of exciting things going on there. But from a dollar percentage increase, it's still going to be led by Europe in the short-term. I was in Asia last week together with Rob and Anne and the two leadership teams, there's definitely significant potential for both brands in China and the rest of Asia. Yes. I've been here now coming up on 12 years. And this is the healthy effect seen the UGG brand. The demand with the consumer, the 18 to 24 year-old consumer, the broad-based health of all of our channels, retail stores, e-commerce sites, wholesale partners globally. And essentially, what you're seeing is the marketplace pull model that we put in place in North America a few years ago. Now that's activated in our international regions. So you're seeing brand heat and consideration among consumers in new international markets, increasing and very strong, and our pull model is still working. So we like to keep things a little bit scarce. And that led to some of the success we saw in this past Q4 where people were still looking for some of our reimagined icons like the Taaz and the Ultra Mini. Normally, we would see those tail-off at the beginning of January and February, but those are still strong and starting to become year-round styles. The other significant thing last year, we -- we sold low single-digits growth in units, but 18% revenue sales on top of that. So we are seeing a very healthy full price business. There is less markdown, there is less assortment in the channel. So we have the right styles for the right consumer in the right locations. And then we are also seeing great success in new franchises like the Goldenstar and venture days. And so that, combined with just the brand heat, the health of the marketplace, the way that the consumer is reacting to our localized marketing activations and our store elevation, we see a lot of optimism for the UGG brand going forward. But you are going to see continued growth in DTC and a real focus on upside in international. Yes. Classics, it is funny to ask that because it used to be all of our conversations and the majority of our business. And we've been able to just maintain that as a steady, healthy premium well-positioned part of our business, roughly around 25%, 30%, steady sell-through steady margin, good handle on inventory and flow -- where we're seeing the exciting thing -- the excitement come from is all these reimagine classics that we're talking about. So iteration of the Tasman, iterations of the Lowmel, the Ultra Mini the Ultra platform. Those styles are broad-based. They are resonating extremely well with younger consumers. They're showing up on influencers in a very powerful way. And then we have a men's business that is starting to show some signs of excitement as well in similar styles. So -- that's really where the growth is being driven from. And we have an incredible pipeline of product that evolves these styles over the next 18, 24 months that I think is just a phenomenal assortment, some of the most exciting product in the market. And then we're also innovating around hybrid slipper-sandal models with increased comfort under foot that I think are going to be really well received. So I think, Anne and the team have done a great job on editing the assortment, getting us out of styles that are met to really focusing on our UGG DNA across any styles that we do. And then a really powerful PR and social media engine to drive it all. And so this is a brand that's in a great place right now. It's very healthy. And we believe that this brand has room to grow and continue at this pace. Thanks Jay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yes. I think what we're experiencing now and you start in fourth quarter is a lot of that demand that we missed in December came to us in Q4. And so when we got back in stock in some of those styles, people still wanted them. And so they were buying them in January, February, March and still are. So I wouldn't say that we missed whatever opportunity we missed in December, it's all lost. We did fulfill some of that demand over the last three to four months. That being said yes, there's opportunity this year. We are excited about the assortment. And I also mentioned, we think we can maintain high levels of full price sales. But it is still going to be a challenging environment out there. I think, that the way we are pegging the business with the assortment, we don't have any necessarily any new price increases this year. And I think, maintaining a tight rein on wholesale and driving it to DTC, I think that's about right, the way we pegged it and the way we're looking at the business going into it now. Comping an 18% growth, there is no cakewalk. Thanks Sam. I will miss you. Yes. Thanks, Janine. On the consumer breadth of HOKA, it is pretty exciting, right? And one thing I can guarantee you that we will always prioritize our performance business first. And so we are \u2013 there is no doubt, we are a performance innovation-driven company. And that's going to be our priority. We'll always prioritize the specialty run accounts. We will always prioritize that -- the hard core running and trail-running consumer. But we obviously have been adopted in a pretty substantial way from a lifestyle perspective. And that's because of the performance that's built into the product. It's not just that they look good, but they feel good. And now they become something that these consumers they not only want the product, they need the product. They need the next color. They need the next version of the Bondi or the Clifton, the Arahi and now the Mach. So that will just expand over time. As we segment the line over time. I mean, as you know, we've been doing this from day one is innovation that's appropriate to the channel segmenting by channel and consumer, particularly as we get into DICK's and JD and Foot Locker and [broader doors] (ph). And there is -- I also believe there's just a generalized trend out there that running is kind of becoming the new streetwear. Those looks are adopted by more consumers now than they ever have been, and we see that continuing. And we welcome those consumers into the brand, but they will be buying performance product from us not lifestyle design product. Yes, I'll tackle with Steve, the DTC versus wholesale. Generally, yes, we will see a slight increase in the rate of DTC growth the way we are looking at it, and that contemplates a little bit lower wholesale, but it is not dramatic on one end or the other. But as we -- as our awareness increases, as we have more international distribution, opening select retail stores, that does drive more traffic and a healthy business to our DTC channel. We convert at a very high rate when people come to our website. And then we have just a growing repeat business from our existing customer base, and the new launch cadence, as you mentioned, brings eyeballs to the site as well. So we are -- and that's by design, we're strategically trying to grow DTC a little bit faster over time because we know that's good for us long term, good for margins, good for health of the marketplace, and that pull model is working extremely well. So you'll see this year that we've modeled it out a little bit better in DTC than wholesale, but on a regional basis, wholesale will be very strong, too. Yes, I think that's a really good point to keep in mind. We are not in a consistent model of new introductions of products and drops, right? It's been changing a little bit year-over-year. We're starting to formalize that a little bit more. But sometimes when you see a drop in sales, say, credit card data, you got to look at what's in the market, when do we drop things? What were we selling last year full price versus markdown? And -- that's why I think if you look at the long view of the year when we have multiple drops over the year, our innovation engine and the pipeline hits the marketplace, it's best to look at that over a 12 months to 18 months period versus three months because there's so many puts and takes from new introductions this year, last year, markdowns, et cetera. So I think Steve is spot on that point. Thanks Jonathan, Take care, man."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, Deckers' performance in fiscal year 2024 was exceptional as we drove our fourth consecutive year of double-digit top-line growth and delivered top-tier levels of profitability. Deckers has added over $1.1 billion of incremental revenue in two years, driven by the strength of the HOKA and UGG brands, as innovative and consumer obsessed product creation continues to resonate globally. Our flexible operating model and disciplined approach to marketplace management has allowed us to capitalize on these high levels of brand heat, while maintaining exceptional levels of full price selling leading to our record earnings in fiscal year 2024. Our dedication to our long-term strategic initiatives continues to be the foundation for our success, as we remain committed to driving profitable growth over the long term. With that, let's get into a recap of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $960 million, representing an increase of 21% versus the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by HOKA and UGG, which saw increases of 34% and 15% respectively. On HOKA the brand delivered its first ever $0.5 billion quarter, as DTC maintained momentum with volume continuing to grow quarter-over-quarter and wholesale reaccelerated from both a percentage and volume perspective, as the brand benefited from key product launches and the wholesale fill-in activity. For UGG, the brand delivered an exceptional quarter, as DTC was able to maintain momentum from Q3, delivering another strong increase despite some inventory shortages on certain key products and wholesale drove growth versus last year, despite selling significantly fewer units as the brand was able to replace the majority of last year's closeout volume with full price shipments into a depleted marketplace and international strength was maintained. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 56.2%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior year. The improved gross margin primarily relates to extraordinary benefits from higher mix of UGG full price selling, including lower closeouts, select price increases as well as favorable brand and product mix and freight savings. SG&A for the fourth quarter was $395 million, representing 41.2% of revenue, which compares to last year's $290 million and a 36.7% of revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 450 basis points year-over-year, primarily as we accelerated top of funnel marketing spend to build longer-term awareness and our strong fiscal 2024 results drove higher performance related compensation. These results, coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count from our share repurchase program drove diluted earnings per share of $4.95 which compares to $3.46 in the prior year period, representing a 43% increase. With the strength of our fourth quarter, Deckers delivered exceptional full year fiscal 2024 results, which includes revenues increasing 18% versus last year to a record $4.288 billion, as compared to last year, revenue growth was driven by robust HOKA growth across regions and channels led by strong DTC growth of 40% as the brand continues to gain awareness across its well-managed ecosystem of access points and broad-based UGG growth, as the brand grew 16% and eclipsed $2.2 billion of revenue primarily through DTC and international strength. Gross margins for the year were 55.6% up 530 basis points versus last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily related to favorable UGG full price selling freight savings, select pricing benefits, as well as favorable brand and product mix and favorable channel mix with DTC growth outpacing wholesale. SG&A dollar spend for the year was $1.46 billion up 24% versus the prior year's $1.17 billion. SG&A represented 34% of revenue, which is 170 basis points above last year's rate. The SG&A increase as compared to last year was driven primarily by investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher performance compensation, higher marketing spend including strategic spend to amplify HOKA awareness, in leading international markets, and infrastructure investments and related depreciation to support the continued growth of our organization. This all resulted in a full fiscal year 2024 operating margin of 21.6%, which is 360 basis points above last year, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced partially offset by the normalization of our rate of SG&A spend. As illustrated by our results, we continue delivering top-tier levels of profitability. And while we are pleased with these results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion experienced particularly from historically low levels of promotion and discounting may not repeat to the same degree in future periods. For the year, our effective tax rate was 22.4%, which is flat to last year. Our strong performance, along with higher interest income and a lower share count from share repurchase activity culminated in a record diluted earnings per share of $29.16, which represents a 51% increase over last year's $19.37. Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31, 2024 we ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $474 million down 11% versus the same point in time last year. And during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately $104 million worth of shares at an average price of $875.01 per share. For the entire fiscal year 2024, we repurchased over 700,000 shares for approximately $415 million at an average per share price of $580.44. At March 31, 2024 the company still had approximately $942 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now moving to our outlook. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect top-line revenue growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year to $4.7 billion with HOKA as the main driver of growth increasing approximately 20%, versus the prior year through consumer acquisition and retention gains in our DTC channel, expanding strategically through key partners, while maintaining disciplined marketplace management and maintaining a dedicated focus on growing awareness and market share internationally. UGG increasing mid-single digits, driven primarily by international expansion and managing a healthy US marketplace, which includes prioritizing our DTC channel as we focus on maintaining the brand's pull model. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 53.5%, which is down 210 basis points versus last year, as we are anticipating a more normalized promotional environment with lower full price selling than the exceptional levels achieved in fiscal year 2024 and higher freight costs. SG&A is expected to be approximately 34% of revenue as we continue reinforcing our foundation and supporting key growth initiatives, which includes increased levels of marketing spend, primarily related to our continued focus to expand global HOKA awareness, investment in talent to bolster integral teams supporting the growth of our organization and IT and warehouse investments. We expect an operating margin of approximately 19.5%, reflecting our commitment to deliver top-tier levels of profitability while continuing to invest for the long-term growth of our brands. We are projecting an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%, with this all resulting in an expected diluted earnings per share in the range of $29.50 to $30. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million, which is above last year as we invest in supply chain and warehouse capabilities, capital IT projects retail refreshments, including opening select new strategic locations and updates to office facilities. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives and delivering towards the full fiscal year. Per normal course, we will not be providing formal quarterly guidance. However given we are more than halfway through the first quarter we wanted to provide some context around our expectations for the quarter ending June 30. These include revenue growth in the high-teens, as we continue to refill depleted channel inventory that is pulling forward demand this year, and HOKA has maintained strong momentum in the DTC channel. Gross margin slightly above the full fiscal year guided rate as we benefit from reduced UGG promotion activity relative to last year in this quarter, select price increases on popular UGG style that we begin to lap in the second quarter and the largest proportion of HOKA revenue contribution. I would additionally note that beyond the first quarter, our gross margin will be up against exceptional levels of full price selling for the UGG brand. And thus, we do not expect the favorability relative to last year to continue beyond Q1. Regarding SG&A, our dollar growth rate in the first quarter is planned significantly higher as we front-load investments to support our growing organization. The higher earlier planned spending is driven by investments in marketing to launch brand campaigns that are further supporting some of the demand shifts we are seeing, as well as some earlier FX remeasurement headwinds resulting from the recent strengthening of the US dollar. Thanks, everyone. And with that, I'll now hand off the call to Dave for his closing remarks. Yes, Jay, this is Steve. Just to kind of add on to that. And I think it's important and Dave touched on it here. But what we saw in FY '24 was fairly significant dollar increase and not so much on the unit side. So because we benefited from full price selling, less close out some of our channel mix, that drove a big proportion of the dollar increase. And while we had some unit increases, what gives us confidence going forward in that mid-single-digit guidance is that we're continuing to see more and more consumers engage in the brand. So demand continues to increase. And so we won't necessarily -- in the guidance we gave, we are expecting that kind of same level of gross margin. But what we do see is with the demand that's out there right, and some of what we delivered in Q4, the consumer response to the product that Dave mentioned, just be continued to see in the marketplace around the UGG brand. And that's what's giving us confidence going forward. Yes. And then, John, just -- this is Steve. On the margin question, we really -- we look at the business and clearly, what we experienced in FY'24 was extraordinary with gross margin expansion. And as you've seen in what we have guided, we don't necessarily expect all of that same benefit in FY '25. So on a comparable basis, as we look at it, continued performance of strong margins, likely moving back to a more normalized level, as we've indicated in our guidance. But generally, no significant change in margins that we're achieving as we're kind of moving into a more normalized environment. Yes. Again, we benefited in all channels with what we saw in FY '24. And so clearly, with some normalization, a bit of a setback. But again, it's still delivering even in a normalized mode exceptional levels of profitability. So the way we're seeing the profile or the framework, not significant change again as we normalize. But as Stefano indicated and Dave has indicated, we're always looking at how we can drive a higher proportion of our DTC business, which overall does have a positive accretive impact on the business. Now it doesn't happen overnight, right? And so with some of the wholesale expansion that we our forecasting in FY '25, that does take some of the growth. So the other thing that we benefited from was a bit of a step-up in our proportion of DTC business in '24 versus '23, and that's because we were running the scarcity model in wholesale. And so we were able to fuel more of that demand over into the DTC channel. That fueled some of our gross margin expansion as we open up a little bit more wholesale in FY '25, again being very strategic and thoughtful about it. That will put some pressure on the DTC growth. But as Dave said, we're still looking to move a higher proportion to DTC, but it won't necessarily be the same step function that you saw in FY '24. Yes. I think also, Sam, this is Steve. Just on that, too, the other consideration is we did expedite product in Q3, and that sold through on DTC, so through e-commerce. This year, we are going to be expanding some of the amount that wholesale is ordering. Again we'll be very careful and strategic about it. But that will put some of the pressure on the DTC growth right? And so again, going back to my earlier answer to one of the previous questions, a big piece of the revenue beat on UGG was this full price selling channel mix shift. And so you're not necessarily going to have that same benefit in FY '25 that we had in '24. Yes. Sam, I think the way we are looking at it is we're not going to get the same benefits in FY '25 that we got in '24. Again so that -- the difference between the revenue change and the unit change is 1 that's really important to understand because what we benefited from in '24 was full-price selling, combined with price increases combined with running a scarcity model that drove more traffic into DTC. So we won't have the same level of benefit on price increases in FY '25 that we had in '24. We'll see what the promotional environment looks like that's always a hard one to determine, especially in the current environment, a lot of uncertainty you are hearing what some other companies are saying. So that's one that we will continue to carefully watch. We're being served well with kind of a controlled marketplace. So we'll continue to look at it. But I don't think the setup to your point, is the same. I think there were more factors that we knew we could benefit from in '24 than in '25, but again we'll manage through '25 and we'll see how it turns on. And then, Janine, just on the SG&A. So I think in terms of where we landed FY '24, the 34% spend to revenue and the guide equivalent for FY '25, we think that kind of the appropriate level, we'll see. It is increasing from where we have been in the past couple of years as we've made investments and continue to make investments, and I called it out in the script in terms of building talent, infrastructure, distribution. So as we are growing and continue to grow at a slightly faster pace than what we anticipated, there is still a bit of a catch-up that you're seeing. I think as we continue to look at the year, we'll manage accordingly. I think that has served us well. We haven't gotten ahead of the growth, but we're carefully monitoring to keep pace with it. And that's some of the increases that you've seen really over the last couple of years. Thanks Janine. Yes. And what I would add, John, just to that is just to be careful about kind of relying too much on a quarter performance. We are managing this for the long run. So again when you have depleted inventory in the channel, that might impact your wholesale growth in one quarter as you're refilling that. It's not necessarily indicative of the longer-term views, back to Dave's point, as we look at growth, clearly, our focus is on trying to grow DTC faster, which is kind of what we are doing and growing the proportion of that. I wouldn't rely too much just on one quarter, or a dynamic in that quarter because there are other factors that affect the short-term, but we're looking at the long-term."

            "content": "Yes, Laurent, to build on what Dave just said, sales has been strong. Our key innovation stories for the season have performed very well. [indiscernible] not huge volumes there, but has performed super, super well beyond our expectations. And Mach 6, has performed -- and is performing very, very well, and it's now a top three style not just for HOKA for Deckers. In Skyward X, which we just launched a couple of weeks ago, the early read is also very, very, very encouraging across the globe. Yes, of course, John. Our business currently is two-thirds US and one-third international, as you know. And the one-third of international, 50% comes from Europe, roughly 35% comes from Asia Pacific and the balance is Canada and Latin America. Clearly, we see a lot of opportunity internationally. And while we expect the US to continue to grow, long term, we would want international to grow faster. We are -- as you heard from Dave, in terms of brand awareness, we are well behind where we are in the US for Hoka and roughly 20 points behind. So we've been investing more, we've been investing faster internationally to accelerate that growth. And also in terms of distribution, we intend to selectively expand our distribution with key partners while carefully monitoring the productivity of the doors we expanded. So there's definitely a lot of upside for us internationally, both in terms of top line as well as margin. Yes. And two new products, John, we have a couple of big programs hitting the market same fall and early next year. Speedgoat is our biggest trail franchise, a new Speedgoat 6 with the market in June. Skyflow is a new run specialty exclusive and DTC exclusive that it's going to hit the market in July. That's a sizable program for us. And Bondi, which is our second biggest show, we'll hit Q4 next year, an updated Bondi and the shoe looks fantastic. I'm very excited about how it's been received by our partners."

Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to speak to the leadership announcement we made today. After 11 years at Deckers, I have decided to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1st. I will continue to serve as a member of the company's Board of Directors. On a personal note, after 30 years in this industry, I am looking forward to spending more time with my family, pursuing my other life passions, and exploring more ways in which I can make a positive impact on the world. Serving as CEO of Deckers has been a great honor, and it's a privilege to work with some of the best talent this industry has to offer. I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments and our unique culture built on doing good and doing great. Deckers continues to demonstrate exceptional performance, and we have a strong foundation from which to continue driving results, a deep bench of talent, and innovative products that are resonating with consumers globally. I believe it's a good time for us to make this transition. We're all thrilled that the Board has selected Stefano Caroti, our Chief Commercial Officer, as Deckers' next President and CEO, following a thorough succession planning process. Many of you know him already, but for those of you who don't, Stefano has an extensive industry and experience, and he seamlessly led our omni-channel regional and HOKA brand operations during some of Deckers' most pivotal years. He is passionate about Deckers and its values, and he has been a key member of the executive team, helping to craft and progress our consumer-focused marketplace strategy and our inclusive and engaged culture. I know Deckers will be in excellent hands with Stefano at the helm. Over the next six months, Stefano and I will continue to execute on Deckers' proven strategy. We're invigorated about this next phase of our work together and for Deckers' bright future. Now let's turn our attention to our Q3 performance. I'm glad to be here today discussing another record-breaking quarter for Deckers brands as our two leading brands continued bucking industry trends to deliver high-quality growth via full-price consumer demand. Key highlights of our record-breaking third quarter results include total company revenue increasing 16% to $1.56 billion, DTC revenue increasing 23%, representing a quarterly record 55% of total company revenue, total UGG revenue increasing 15% to achieve its first-ever billion dollar quarter, total HOKA revenue increasing 22% to $429 million, total company gross margins increasing over 500 basis points to an all-time quarterly high of 58.7%, and diluted earnings per share increasing 44% to $15.11. We believe the success of our brands and company as a whole continues to be the direct result of innovative product that is on trend and resonates with consumers across the globe, decision-making that is guided by our long-term strategic objectives, alignment between product creation, marketing, and omni-channel distribution that centers around the consumer, and the strong execution of our teams to deliver in real time while remaining focused on the longer-term vision of our marquee brand. We are thrilled by the success of this quarter, but I feel it's important to reflect on how these results represent a continuation of strong year-to-date performance as well as many years of careful strategic execution. Our brands are thinking long-term, and while we are happy to produce great quarterly results, we are even more pleased to see the consistency of performance. With the first three quarters of this fiscal year behind us, we believe we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth, which would be the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth in the mid-teens or higher. Highlights from the first nine months include global HOKA revenue growing 25% versus last year, led by a near 50% increase in DTC; global UGG revenue increasing 16% versus last year, led by international regions growing close to 30%, and global DTC increasing more than 20%; and total portfolio DTC revenue increasing 28% with robust growth in both consumer acquisition and retention. I am extremely proud of the collaboration across the Deckers organization to deliver these exceptional results through the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. We are creating remarkably distinct, relevant, and breakthrough product concepts that are deeply rooted in consumer insights and brand DNA. This is distinguishing our brands from the competition. Our strategic execution of brand and marketplace management, combined with our financial discipline, preserves Deckers\u2019 position of strength as we focus on closing out fiscal year 2024 and plan for the significant opportunity in the years ahead.  Steve will provide additional color on this quarter's financial performance and our related increased outlook for the full fiscal year, but in the meantime, let's dive into third quarter brand and channel highlights. Starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, representing a 15% increase versus the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by global DTC, which increased 20% in the quarter to represent 62% of total brand revenue, up from 60% last year, aided by international and domestic consumer acquisition increasing 14% and 8%, respectively, and retained consumers increasing 26% and 8% across international and domestic regions, respectively. In addition to driving a significant increase to gross margin, the outsized growth from DTC helped deliver a double-digit increase in the brand's consolidated global average selling price. As in general, DTC selling resulted in a much higher ASP and a favorable gross margin relative to the wholesale channel, UGG commended extraordinarily high levels of full-price selling, and the brand benefited from select price increases on a few of its most popular styles. The cohesion of product, marketing, and consumer targeting, in addition to a reduced SKU count, drove focused energy behind key styles, which has greatly contributed to the success UGG is experiencing this year. Recognizing that there was unmet consumer demand last year and capitalizing on the continued brand momentum driven by that scarcity, the UGG team invested in additional inventory to support its most popular product. Helping fuel brand heat and further the conversation with target consumers during the third quarter, UGG spearheaded meaningful collaborations, most notably with Palace Skateboards, selling out in minutes across key cities like New York, Los Angeles, London, and Tokyo, hosted pinnacle brand experience feel houses in New York, Paris, and Seoul, and launched the first of its kind UGGextreme capsule that features fashionable performance products capable of handling winter's most brutal conditions. These top-of-the-funnel brand activations, combined with community building and social listening across digital platforms, help UGG create positive brand buzz and increase opportunities for consumer connections that offer feedback in real-time. This year's coordination between DTC operations and product marketing on social channels elevated the launches of new styles or colors and brought greater traffic and attention to the brand when hot products were being restocked. From a regional standpoint, UGG has maintained high levels of brand heat and demand almost universally across the globe to deliver strong year-to-date growth across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Helping bolster UGG performance in the third quarter, the brand opened a couple of exciting new stores in key markets, including a Shanghai flagship, which offers one of the most contemporary visual expressions of UGG anywhere in the world, and the brand's first full-price location in Germany with a new Munich store. Both stores are performing extremely well. In Shanghai, we are seeing average transaction values that are approximately 20% above the average UGG store in China, as well as the conversion rate more than double that of the average. Though early days, the Munich store is experiencing ATVs that are 25% higher than the average European UGG store, with conversion rate well above that of the average UGG store in Germany. Similar to what we often see in markets where new stores opened, Germany's online business for UGG benefited from this additional consumer touchpoint, boasting both the highest online growth rate and highest conversion rate of any European country in the third quarter for the brand. We are pleased to see these new consumer touchpoints are helping produce positive results in key international markets, where we continue to see long-term opportunities for the UGG brand. The success UGG is now experiencing among international regions is a direct result of our thoughtful, multiyear marketplace management implementation that fostered the alignment of product creation, localized marketing content, and brand-enhancing distribution partners. With the momentum and brand heat UGG has created among international markets, we are even more excited about the global opportunities ahead. From a style perspective, UGG experienced growth and success with key franchises like the Tasman, Ultra Mini, and Classic Mini, including the fashion-oriented platform versions of each, as well as new introductions that include the Weather Hybrid Collection, Goldenstar Clog, and the Lowmel Sneaker. The Weather Hybrid Collection was positioned as a modern, weatherized update to a few of the UGG brand's most popular styles, including the Tasman, Neumel, and Classic Boot. Our PRR teams partnered with influential NBA star, Jaylen Brown, to highlight the launch, which helped this all-gender collection drive strong sell-through among all consumers. The Goldenstar Clog was somewhat of a surprise hit during the holiday season, as it was created to bolster the shoulder seasons outside of winter, complementing the rising Goldenstar Sandal. The Lowmel, which we see as the first unmistakably UGG sneaker, represented a continuation of our hybrid strategy to redefine categories through UGG DNA. We believe Tasman\u2019s adoption of the sneaker versus previously being purchased primarily as an indoor slipper, has given UGG permission to play in the sneaker category, in which the Lowmel performed extremely well, selling out quickly across the globe. Both the Goldenstar Clog and Lowmel have been positioned for expansion into this spring and next fall, as the UGG brand continues to build connections with consumers through a cohesive, year-round, product assortment. Through the first nine months of this fiscal year, UGG has delivered undeniably impressive results. The brand has driven exceptional growth in focus areas, including international regions and global DTC, and has done so by acquiring and retaining target consumers with full priced products. I\u2019d like to congratulate and thank the entire UGG team for their hard work and collaboration that enabled the brand\u2019s success in the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date. Shifting to HOKA, global HOKA revenue in the third quarter was $429 million, representing a 22% increase versus the prior year. HOKA has continued to deliver consistent year-over-year growth and volume each quarter this year, reflecting the brand\u2019s balanced seasonality in year-round demand. Similar to what HOKA experienced in the first half, third quarter growth was primarily driven by gains in the DTC channel as intended, with HOKA diligently managing the wholesale marketplace to drive market share gains with high levels of full price sell through. More specifically on DTC performance, HOKA revenue in the channel increased 38% in Q3, representing over 40% of total brand revenue, which is 5 percentage points higher than last year. DTC growth has been driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition, with international and domestic experience growth of 50% and 27% respectively, and important gains in retained consumers, which increased 55% internationally and 33% in the U.S. The HOKA brand\u2019s DTC business has been strong in every single region this year, but has been particularly powerful in Europe and China, two regions where we have been emphasizing growth in the channel as brand awareness grows. Both regions have benefited from a greater retail presence. In Europe, HOKA opens its first retail location in Covent Garden, London, during the third quarter, which is performing exceptionally well, and the brand has a location planned to open in Paris in time for the Olympics. In China, HOKA has added four new company-owned locations throughout this year, in which the consumer experience has continued to improve, particularly with a greater focus on key stories and a new capsule collection of apparel that rounded out a compelling in-store product assortment. Complimenting the added stores in China, we continue to see our premiumization efforts online paying off, as HOKA has achieved high levels of full price sell through online, which is the channel that China generally uses for promotion activity. One example of this during the third quarter was China\u2019s annual Double 11 event, better known as Singles Day, which is a countrywide event that features widespread discounts across brands and product categories known for driving significant consumer traffic online. This year, HOKA benefited from the online traffic despite low levels of promotion and maintains strong full price selling, particularly in comparison to competitive brands. We are very encouraged by the increasing adoption of HOKA across international markets, particularly in the DTC channel, where we have been focusing our growth efforts while managing the wholesale environment to maintain high levels of full price sell through. We believe HOKA is still in the early stages of expansion internationally, as we continue to build brand awareness in key markets to establish HOKA as a major worldwide player in the performance space. Over in the U.S., where we also see a significant opportunity for growth, I want to take a moment to highlight an amazing event that HOKA had a huge impact on during the third quarter. HOKA was a presenting sponsor of the 44th Annual Foot Locker Cross Country National Championships, outfitting thousands of elite high school athletes with complementary footwear and apparel. This event was the center of the U.S. running world and media for three days, driving significant impressions and some of the highest brand engagement we have ever seen for HOKA. On the product front, HOKA continues to develop and refine a compelling assortment of performance products that enable athletes of all kinds to achieve their goals. This morning, HOKA announced the introduction of the all new Cielo X1 that sits atop the brand\u2019s assortment as the ultimate race day shoe for the most discerning athletes. The Cielo X1 was designed with insights and feedback from the HOKA brand\u2019s roster of elite athletes, incorporating the most advanced geometry, foam compounds, and plate technologies to enable record setting results. Before it was even commercially available, the Cielo X1 has already made its podium debut as HOKA NAZ Elite member Kellyn Taylor won the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll San Jose Half Marathon wearing the Cielo X1, qualifying her for the 2024 Olympics Marathon Trials for Team USA. Beyond the brand\u2019s pinnacle performance product, HOKA is also experiencing success with exciting lifestyle-oriented products. These products feature the same quality and comfort expected from a performance HOKA shoe, but are packaged in an everyday wear aesthetic for more versatile wearing occasions. The HOKA transport has become the brand\u2019s go-to casual shoe, now sitting within the brand\u2019s top 10 best sellers. The HOKA brand\u2019s captivating collaborations are also furthering its resonance with the lifestyle consumer. They are designed to reach a new audience by partnering with logical yet unexpected brands. Most recently, HOKA partnered with Satisfy Running, a French running apparel brand, to co-create an exciting new take on the Clifton LS, which sold out almost instantly. Highlighting the partnerships theme of highs and lows, Satisfy created a one-of-a-kind community experience that brought together the skateboard, trail, and running communities to join in a sprint down the steep hills of San Francisco. As we continue building HOKA for the long-term, our focus is to remain a top brand in road running, expanding with innovative performance footwear, become a dominant off-road player with disruptive trail and hike products, and bring the HOKA experience to the lifestyle consumer while keeping the brand rooted in performance. While we are at different stages of this journey across domestic and international markets, we see significant global opportunities ahead with this powerful brand. We are proud of the consistent momentum HOKA is achieving around the world. Our efforts to build brand awareness and drive high full price sell-through continue to bear fruit and have set the stage for a strong finish to the year with another record quarter. Now moving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. During the third quarter, performance remained strong across both DTC and wholesale. However, in line with our strategic objectives, DTC remained the fastest growing channel, increasing 23% versus last year to represent a record 55% of the quarter\u2019s revenue, up from 52% in the prior year. DTC success continues to be broad-based across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 38% and 20% respectively, regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 40% and 16% respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 13% and 16% respectively across all brands. In addition, as discussed, we are also experiencing strong engagement with our brands both online and in store, reflecting the quality of our omni-channel operations and ability to provide a consistent consumer experience. Furthering the success of DTC, we continue to see a double-digit increase in the average selling price through the third quarter, driven by a greater mix of HOKA which carries the highest ASP in the portfolio, higher UGG full price selling, including benefits from select price increases and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. With respect to consolidated wholesale performance, third quarter revenue increased 9% versus last year with domestic HOKA and UGG contributing the majority of the incremental dollar volume. We are very pleased with this strong wholesale result, especially considering the tight marketplace management we have been focused on executing during this fiscal year. As a result of these efforts, our brands drove high levels of full price sell through, entering calendar 2024 with lean channel inventories that have created opportunities for market share gains going forward. Thanks, everyone, and now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Steve to provide more specifics on third quarter performance and an update to our fiscal year 2024 guidance.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance exceeded expectations and demonstrated the continued strength of our brands. As Dave mentioned, UGG delivered strong growth in the quarter as exceptional brand heat continued to capture consumers globally and we were able to meet incremental demand through our DTC channel in the quarter with expedited shipments of the brand\u2019s most popular styles. HOKA drove another quarter of solid growth led by the DTC channel as we continued to diligently manage the wholesale marketplace, all while driving high levels of full price sell through. These results are a testament to the exceptional demand for our brands as our compelling and innovative product offerings continue to resonate with consumers globally during the holiday season and well beyond, helping drive phenomenal performance. Our disciplined operating approach and robust financial profile have continued to enable our brands and company to execute a strategy that delivers strong results while keeping us positioned to achieve our commitment to driving success over the long-term. Now, let\u2019s get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance. Third quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.56 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 15% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels delivering $1.07 billion of revenue, with global DTC increasing 20% as brand heat remains robust with all DTC regions exhibiting a double-digit percentage growth in the period and continued strong demand across the HOKA ecosystem of access points with particular strength in the DTC channel, which increased 38% versus last year, contributing to the brand\u2019s total revenue of $429 million in the quarter. Notably, HOKA\u2019s DTC performance for the quarter was aided by global increases in consumer acquisition, which was up 31% versus last year, and consumer retention, which was up 35% versus last year. Additionally, I would note that this quarter\u2019s revenue growth was aided by a higher percentage of full price selling as well as the UGG brand select price increases, both of which contributed to dollar growth outpacing unit growth. While we will always manage our brands with the intent to deliver high levels of full price selling, the level we experienced this year, particularly for UGG in its peak season is one we don\u2019t expect will always repeat. This dynamic combined with a larger than expected impact from price increases due to the strength of performance from affected styles is part of the catalyst for our increased full year expectations for UGG growth. Gross margins for the quarter was 58.7%, which was up 580 basis points from last year\u2019s 53%. As compared to last year, gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher mix of UGG full price selling, freight savings, select pricing action and favorable brand and product mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. While we are exceptionally proud of these remarkable results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion seen this quarter is above normalized levels and is not something we anticipate will repeat to the same degree. While we do see opportunities to continue to deliver top tier profitability through our key strategies, items that we anticipate may not repeat in a normalized environment include the extremely low levels of promotional activity achieved for our two major brands, considerable benefits from UGG pricing actions and very low freight costs that are now on the rise, as well as other potential macroeconomic factors such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. SG&A dollar spend in the third quarter was $429 million, up 23% versus last year\u2019s $350 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 150 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher marketing spend. Our tax rate was 21.9%, which is lower than last year\u2019s 23.7%. These results, combined with favorable interest income relative to last year and a lower share count, drove record diluted earnings per share of $15.11, which compares to last year\u2019s $10.48 diluted earnings per share representing EPS growth of 44%. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2023, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.65 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $539 million, down 25% versus the same point in time last year, and during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. On inventory, specifically, I\u2019d note that with the strong levels of selling that we have seen this year, we are now below normal operating levels for the current size of our organization. And heading into next year, we expect to see incremental inventory investment to keep up with growth. Today's inventory position reflects the upside that has already been captured in the quarter just completed, which could have a small impact on sales in the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average price of $507.95. As of December 31, 2023, the company had approximately $1.05 billion remaining authorized for share repurchase. Now moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2024. Based on the strong demand experienced in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be approximately $4.15 billion, up from our previous guidance of approximately $4.025 billion. This increase now equates to full year growth expectations of approximately 14% versus last year. From a brand perspective, we now expect UGG revenue growth of low double digits up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits. This full year increase is the result of the strong DTC demand that we experienced and fulfilled in the third quarter. Full year HOKA revenue growth of approximately 25%, with strong third quarter sell-through driving wholesale refill upside in the fourth quarter, reflecting our disciplined marketplace management. In addition to our fiscal year 2024 updated revenue outlook, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 54.5%. As UGG experienced high levels of full price selling, including Key Styles contributing incremental margin from price increases as brand heat continued to drive strong demand. SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be approximately 34.5% as we have identified areas to accelerate spend in Q4 with revenue growth exceeding expectations for fiscal year 2024. We believe this additional spend, part of which represents top-of-funnel marketing opportunities, gives our brands the opportunity to defend their current positions of strength, setting the foundation for the future. Additionally, I would note that some of the third and fourth quarter spending timing dynamics related to unrealized FX gains recorded in Q3 that we expect will be offset in Q4 as rates have recently moved in the opposite direction. With these updates, we are increasing our operating margin for the year and now expect it to be approximately 20%, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced. Our effective tax rate is now projected to be approximately 22%. And finally, with these updates, we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectations to now be in the range of $26.25 to $26.50. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate. This guidance update represents a $3.25 increase on the prior top end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range. Based on the success that we've seen this year with strong sell-through and high levels of full price selling, there are a few business dynamics related to the fourth quarter that we would like to highlight, including U.S. wholesale shipments that went out at the tail end of the third quarter of this year that have historically occurred in the fourth quarter. Meaningful revenue from UGG closeouts last year that will not repeat this year and low levels of inventory on Key Styles that have been driving the business this fiscal year. We, of course, still expect to deliver a strong fourth quarter that is now projected to round out Deckers fourth consecutive year of at least mid-teens top line revenue growth, while also consistently delivering exceptional high levels of operating profitability. We would note that some of the benefit to our operating profitability we're seeing are outsized and may not repeat in future years, but we remain dedicated to delivering operating profitability in the top tier among our peer group even as we continue to invest in our organization to enable future growth. As we've said in the past, if revenue growth comes faster than our ability to keep pace with investments, some of the related profit expansion may flow through to the bottom line near term. However, we continue to recognize the importance of funding our strategic initiatives moving into next year and maintain a focus on the long-term vision for our brands. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach as we enter our final fiscal quarter and begin planning for next fiscal year. Our largest brands are two of the healthiest and most in demand in our industry. With a robust balance sheet and our diligent operating approach, we are well positioned to drive future success and look forward to providing more details on our year-end call. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. We are extremely proud of our brand's year-to-date performance, which have produced record revenue and earnings results. As we look beyond fiscal year 2024, I believe we have an incredibly strong innovation pipeline for the UGG and HOKA brands, giving us further confidence in our ability to build upon this year's exceptional growth. Thinking into the next few years, we believe HOKA remains our primary growth vehicle with considerable opportunity for both region and category expansion as awareness of the brand's innovative performance product increases further, and continue to position UGG for growth through the development of category hybrids that celebrate heritage brand codes to resonate with target consumers across global markets. Deckers strategic focus on marketplace management, omnichannel strategy and flexible operating model continues to be the driving force behind our sustained success. We remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives while continuing to deliver high levels of profitability and driving shareholder value. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our employees across the organization for their consistent and dedicated focus to driving results aligned with our long-term strategic vision. Our employees continue to go above and beyond while upholding Deckers values. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to give Stefano a moment to say a few words. Stefano?\nStefano Caroti: Dave, thank you for the kind introduction, and good afternoon, everyone. It is a privilege to have been named Deckers next CEO. During my tenure here, I have had the chance to grow with Deckers, as we've made significant strides building beautiful and innovative brands that resonate with consumers around the world. I understand and appreciate the immense effort it has taken to get us where we are today. And I'm passionate about our people, our organization and the continuation of our collective success. I believe Deckers is well positioned to continue cutting through a highly competitive marketplace and take advantage of the many opportunities ahead with the support of our dedicated management team and all the good people at Deckers. Over the next six months, I look forward to working with Dave, who has become a great mentor, colleague and friend to continue executing on our strategy and ensure a smooth transition. Thanks, Dave. Back to you.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Stefano, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to sharing more next quarter as we continue to build towards Deckers exciting future. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Nikic from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nTom Nikic: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and Dave, congratulations on a great run and Stefano looking forward to working with you. So look, on HOKA, so it kind of sounds like you're embedding a little bit of a reacceleration, I guess, specifically in the wholesale channel in the fourth quarter. Is that just inventory levels being really lean? Is it sell-in of the new products? Is it door expansion with Decks and Foot Locker, if I could just kind of unpack how to think about the drivers of HOKA wholesale that would be greatly appreciated?\nDave Powers: Yes, very happy to answer that question. And first of all, I apologize, my voice is a little rough, I'm fighting a cold at the moment. But yes, HOKA we had a great quarter for HOKA Q3, as you're hoping the results right on plan, right on strategy. And the teams continue to execute at a level globally. And Q4, it's a combination of things. There's a lot of refill orders that will be going into wholesale fulfilling that demand and getting back in stock as we head into spring. And then as we mentioned before, we have some really exciting new product launches that are coming out in Q4 as well as planned. So continue to be very strong momentum executing on the strategy. Q4 is looking solid for us. No new doors at the end of the year, no net new doors. We'll continue to evaluate that based on how the market performs and how HOKA sells through. And we're very pleased and optimistic about this quarter ahead.\nTom Nikic: Sounds good. And just if I could follow up also just one on UGG. Obviously, you've had a couple of great holiday seasons in a row. What do you do for non-core next year?\nDave Powers: Yes. Well, it's a good question, right? I mean, our history has been a little bit volatile. But listen, I think this is a new era for UGG. We have an incredible new leadership team. The innovation pipeline is resonating incredibly well with our global consumers. We're expanding categories beyond our core icon styles and the momentum is real. This is the most exciting quarter I've ever seen for UGG with regard to global brand heat, global sell-through every region, every channel is performing well with the UGG brand right now. And we were light on inventory. We have an incredible quarter of growth, but there's still opportunity. And we're going into this coming fall with a position of real strength with healthy inventory levels, clean marketplace. We had some price increases that didn't slow us down. And we still think there's a lot of demand out there to be had. Across the women's, especially a lot of the icons that we were successful in this year. But with some new introductions like the Lowmel, the Weather Hybrids in men's, we think there's a lot of upside still for this brand. And we're going to stay the course and manage this marketplace incredibly tight as we have been and prioritize DTC and that formula continues to pay off major dividends for us.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, Tom. And just to add to that, this is Steve. I think the \u2013 as we look at the success that we had in Q3, this is where our marketplace management works.\nTom Nikic: Exactly.\nSteve Fasching: We are containing that wholesale channel. We're lowing some of the demand over to our DTC channel. And this is really where you're seeing the power of that work. You see it with the gross margin expansion. And so that's a model that we're going to continue to reinforce next year. And we know we're leaving demand on the table and that's by design. So we continue to build D-to-C brands by controlling that marketplace distribution, lowing some of that excess over into D-to-C, and leaving some demand on the table. Yes.\nTom Nikic: Sounds good. Thanks very much. And Dave, best of luck in your future endeavors.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. And Dave, I wanted to wish you the best for your future endeavors. You will be missed by many. And Stefano, it's great to have you on the call.\nStefano Caroti: Thanks, Laurent.\nLaurent Vasilescu: I wanted to just follow up. I wanted to follow up, Dave, on some of the \u2013 there are some targets out there long-term. There's that $5 billion to $6 billion target, 50% DTC mix. Is there anything that changes over the long-term on these targets that you maybe want to update? And then could you maybe also provide \u2013 Steve, I think you maybe kind of alluded to, sometimes you'll over earn that 20% EBIT margin for fiscal year 2024. Is there a raise, like resting heart rate [ph] for EBIT margin for this business long term?\nDave Powers: Yes, Laurent. Good question. So with regards to long-term strategy, I think, it's important to stress, it\u2019s particularly with [indiscernible] coming up, that we are still focused on what we've talked about before. So, Stefano and I are sitting here saying, hey, there is a major change that needs to happen. It's more about continuing the momentum that, quite frankly, Stefano and his team have helped create. So the targets that we spoke about before, those are ranges that we've talked about. We think there's potential to get there. It's not a hard target. But the strategy is in place. We have \u2013 we have that \u2013 the way we're managing the marketplace and the way they're presenting these brands in the market to our consumers, where we're connecting with our consumers just gives us more confidence, especially coming out of a quarter like this, that those targets are achievable. And I think this \u2013 the quarterly results represented great examples of how we're migrating closer to DTC and more business through DTC and then building more heat for these brands over time. So as we get more consumers into the fold, that will continue, and we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity for HOKA, but also for UGG at the same time. So stay the course, lots to get after still, particularly with the strength of the international markets coming on now, and we're confident we can get there.\nStefano Caroti: Yes, then, Laurent, kind of on the operating margin, and we've talked about this before on prior calls. The way we look at the business is kind of a high teen margin business. And as I've said in the past is when we have an opportunity, when the business runs so well and delivers margins above that like we've seen in Q3, we will let some of that margin run through. We're not out just to spend money for the sake of spending money. We carefully watch where we're placing our investments. And when we see the opportunities to invest, we will take that. And that's the way we approach kind of every year. In a given year where we're seeing such strong full price selling, like we did this year where our brands and product are in such demand, it's a perfect case where we can flow through some of that. You've seen that in prior years, but at the same time, as we've indicated in our full year outlook, where we've raised it, we're also looking at where we can continue to invest in our brands because we know the competition is stepping up as well. So this provides us an opportunity that when we are performing well, we'll pass through some of that. But at the same time, we're looking at the long-term health of the business and we'll make the right investments to continue to drive this business forward in the long run. So that's our approach. That's not going to change. It's working for us and you can kind of see how that's driving these types of results.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very clear. And as a follow-up question on the UGG business, Steve, I think you alluded to some timing shifts between 3Q and 4Q. Maybe for the audience, could you quantify that number? And then going back to Tom's question about next year's encore, Dave, Steve, Stefano, we are getting that question from investors like, oh, just 50% UGG growth for this year \u2013 for this quarter. It's just \u2013 it's going to be that much harder. I know you're not prepared to guide for next year, but any indication on the order book for next fall would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, so I'll start, Laurent. In terms of some of the shifts, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is, yes, we are seeing where some of the over performance of Q3, because again, as you know, we haven't guided orders, where we did see some earlier wholesale deliveries in Q3. That's slightly impacting our Q4. In terms of our full year, we have raised our full year and that's really a reflection of the strength that we've seen in Q3. Because we haven't given quarterly guidance, I know everybody's models may be a little bit different. And so it's hard to say specifically kind of how you're looking at it. The way we've looked at it is some of the business that we thought may happen in Q4 did come at us in Q3 as the sell-through was very strong. And so we took advantage of that, and we were able to kind of shift some of that price. Generally speaking, what you're seeing is the business has performed better than what we expected. We have flowed that through on our full year lift, and we're seeing Q4 kind of as we've seen it with a little bit of timing issues [ph]. But overall, I think, the takeaway is incredible performance in Q3. We've flowed that through, we've lifted our full year, business is incredibly strong, and the demand for our brands is there.\nDave Powers: Yeah, and with regards to UGG coming up into fall of 2024, we're confident. We see UGG now as a growth brand within the portfolio. Will it be double-digit, 15%, like we just experienced? We won't be planning for that, but we still think there is growth to be added. I think it's important to remind folks that UGG is in a very different position than it has been in the past. And I talked about this in the last call. We used to sell primarily Classics, Classic Short, Classic Tall, different colors, iterations, and a few slippers to go with that, and the distribution was pretty similar across the marketplace. UGG is much more diversified now, we're selling boots, we're selling slippers, we're selling new hybrid innovations, and we're starting to sell our version of sneakers. And it's a younger consumer. It's a more diverse consumer. We have segmentation in the marketplace globally. We have a lot of untapped potential in the international markets, and we're going to continue to play this through with the strength of our product innovation pipeline and the strength of our marketing teams to continue to drive this as a growth brand for years to come.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Super helpful. Thank you very much for all the color. And best of luck, Dave. \nDave Powers: All right. Thanks, buddy.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much, Dave. I wanted to follow-up on some of those comments you made about UGG, how much more diversified the product line is today. Can you give us a sense of, in the third quarter, what percentage of the business was boots, kind of the Classic too and sort of the derivatives of that versus sort of the newer stuff, Neumel and some of your versions of sneakers and some things that's really kind of different over the last couple of years? And if you could sort of compare that to where that was a couple of years ago, that'd be helpful.\nDave Powers: Yes, I don't have the exact specifics on that, but I will say the core Classics are really just a maintained business at this point, so it's not like we're purposely trying to shrink those. Those are still healthy. We are just managing that category and that product better in the marketplace. But the growth is coming from some of the newness, the Taz, the platform style, the Ultra Mini, and then, like I said, some of the sneaker versions and the hybrid winter programs. And as you notice, we launched UGGextreme, which is our first serious foray into more performance products. So this is a brand that has really broad shoulders. I have always said that. And I think now we're seeing, once we get the right design DNA into these categories that are really innovative and distinct, there's really nothing like this product in the marketplace. We have a lot of runway and so we're going to continue to innovate, continue to attack these categories with a focused assortment of UGG DNA products and connect with our consumers in a segmented way. And I think there is still a tremendous upside there. So lots to be confident with the UGG brand. I think this is an indication of the new leadership that Anne has brought to the team and the discipline in the marketplace, as well as our innovation pipeline. And we're optimistic this is going to continue at a healthy pace going forward.\nJay Sole: Got it, understood. I'll try to ask one a different way, hopefully this is okay, but it's just so fascinating what you've accomplished with UGG. Can you maybe just tell us, if we just think about the business where it was five years ago, mainly boots, what was the total addressable market for that category? And sort of how would you size the total addressable market for UGG today, given the sneakers that you're doing and all the different categories that have emerged?\nDave Powers: I'll let Steve answer that real quick.\nSteve Fasching: Yes Jay, it's a good question. Clearly the addressable market, it has grown from where we were five years ago. I think another way to look at it, and I know what you're trying to kind of get at is what's the future growth opportunities for UGG? I think what we've seen, especially in this last year, is how UGG is being adopted for different use cases than it was five years ago. And so that total addressable market continues to increase as we are seeing greater adoption around our product. And so to Dave's point about what we're excited about, what we saw in Q3, is we're seeing heritage products resonate with consumers, but iterations of that, where we've created newness in categories that consumers are adopting. And so we've also talked about some of the demographic reach, and we're seeing a younger demographic come into the brand with a strong excitement. You've really seen that come through in Q3. It's what's driving some of that DTC performance. And then we're seeing it grow internationally. So as you recall, five years ago, we talked about how we were going to deliver the progress in North America and then export that success to the international market. And now what you're seeing is those international markets growing at a faster rate, albeit smaller dollars, but at a faster rate on percentage terms than we're seeing domestic. And that shows you how the consumer is embracing the UGG brand across the globe in different use cases. And through the last couple of years, what we've learned is through some of this casualization, the adoption of UGG for different use cases. And we're continuing to see that demand grow, and that's what gives us excitement about where we can go with this brand.\nDave Powers: Yes, and the last thing I would say, if you think about this brand five years ago, it was a boot brand. And we've had that stigma attached to UGG brand for quite some time. And I think that those days are in the past. We have products that is resonating in different categories that we've never had before. And I'm really excited about the Lowmel, that it\u2019s our version of a sneaker. And I think that\u2019s going to be a best seller for years to come and start potentially taking share from some of the sneaker brands out there.\nJay Sole: Got it. All right. That\u2019s fascinating. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.\nDave Powers: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Janine Stichter from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, congrats on the results. And Dave, wish you all the best as well.\nDave Powers: Thank you so much.\nJanine Stichter: I wanted to get to pricing a little bit. Yes. And UGG, could you elaborate on the price increase there? How big was it? When did you take it? And maybe how broad was it in terms of the styles? And then curious about any future opportunities for price increases. And I guess the same question for HOKA. I think you\u2019ve talked about being pretty happy where the pricing is there. But do you see any opportunities just as some of your peers potentially look at taking that price? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes. Thanks, Janine, and great question. We are and we have been and will do continue to look at prices strategically. And so some of the decisions we made this year were really just on a handful of styles in UGG. But in really, some of our bestsellers who are proved to be our bestsellers. So that\u2019s why you saw the exponential impact of revenue on some of those styles as they perform so well at full price in the added $5 or $10 made a big difference on a lot of units. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate it. We don\u2019t see massive price increase in broad base this fall. We\u2019re still evaluating that, but it\u2019ll be selected by market and style if we do that. And then the same approach for HOKA, we\u2019re comfortable with prices are right now we think we are providing incredible value for the dollar. There\u2019s opportunities to raise prices a little bit here and there as we continue to roll out more innovation. But pricing \u2013 growth through pricing is not a strategy of ours, it\u2019s pricing the appropriate the product in the market for the consumer, and that\u2019ll drive our decision.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. And Janine, just to add a little bit on that, as Dave said, it was not across the Board. It was very surgical in terms of units that we identified had the potential to absorb a price increase without much consumer resistance to it. And that was significant. And so it was not a lot of styles, it was on styles that we knew would do well. And so it was surgical in the sense of, those high performing styles, and it drove a big portion. So just in terms of quantified a little bit, in the quarter, our gross margin from last year was at 580 basis points. I think the other thing that was a big contributor along with price increases, we didn\u2019t get promotional. This was a full, strong, price, sell-through quarter for us. So of that 580 basis points, about 340 of it came from not being promotional, and the price increases that we experienced in the quarter. So a big dry growth quarter [ph]. And as Dave said, we\u2019re not looking to decrease in this to kind of continue to drive that. We\u2019re going to be very careful about how we place price increases and how we contemplate it. But this year was one year that we benefited from it that we will not necessarily see in future periods.\nJanine Stichter: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. And just in terms of the gross margin, it\u2019s fair to assume that there might be some more promotions in the future as that kind of normalizes the pricing for you to stick. So at least a portion of the 580 basis points remains structural.\nDave Powers: Yes. Yes.\nSteve Fasching: Yes.\nJanine Stichter: Perfect. Thanks so much and best of luck.\nDave Powers: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Sam Poser from Williams Trading. Please proceed.\nSam Poser: Well, thank you for taking my questions. So Erinn, we already have UGG and HOKA. So could you give me Teva, Sanuk and the other or my favorite question and then I have other questions because I wish you just give all of it.\nErinn Kohler: Sure, Sam. So real quick for the third quarter total wholesale and distributor for UGG as you mentioned, you can count is $403 million, HOKA $252 million, Teva $20 million, Sanuk $2 million and then other largely Koolaburra $24.5 million.\nSam Poser: Thank you. Okay. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far in January, it looks as if \u2013 well, first of all, Dave, congratulations. Totally awesome for it. We\u2019re very \u2013 I\u2019m very happy for you and I hope to get to see you before you sail out into the sunset off the beach of Belita.\nDave Powers: Thank you, Sam. I appreciate that.\nSam Poser: The \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a lot of sales in your own retail stores around New York like the there \u2013 I\u2019m hearing that like retailers are getting \u2013 your wholesale accounts are getting small hits. But are you gearing a lot of what\u2019s going on in the fourth quarter for UGG to really more so than usual like just pushing it to your DTC given that a lot of those orders are \u2013 people are just trying to get whatever they can, so you\u2019re going to feed yourself a lot more?\nDave Powers: I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re forcing more inventory purposely away from wholesale into DTC. What I would say is I think the teams have gotten better at allocating the right amount of inventory for our stores, so that we\u2019re not missing sales when the customer comes in. And we\u2019ve been guilty of that in the last few years, not having protected some of the inventory in this kind of demand. Some of that inventory can get sucked up by DTC or wholesale fill-ins, so we\u2019re protecting it better than we have for our stores and just making sure that we\u2019re balancing out across wholesale and retail and e-commerce as best we can for the consumer and how they like to shop. Just so happens, though, when you have this kind of brand heat momentum, if there are wholesale partners that are running low on inventory, they\u2019re going to go to our stores to find it and our websites to find it. And this is an indication of what happened, but it\u2019s also a strong indication of how well our pull model is working. And we have a pull model like that, it does help generally benefit your DTC business a little bit more.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then lastly, you sort of hinted that was a new thing coming from Deckers X Labs. I heard that it might be the reentry \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard from some retailers they\u2019ve seen some of the product for fall. And I heard it might be under the Anuk Reborn.Could you give us some color as to what may be going on over there?\nDave Powers: Yes. Well, I will say, it\u2019s exciting for us. We established this Deckers Lab innovation engine a few years ago with the help of Jean-Luc, who is one of the co-founders of HOKA. And that has been quietly building as a force for our pipeline for all of our brands. So some of the innovation you\u2019re seeing in UGG and HOKA, and we\u2019ll soon see some of that in Teva as well, has come from that. And one of the things we uncover is there\u2019s an opportunity for a new kind of sneaker brand. So we would put this under the category of super sneaker brand. It\u2019s pretty exciting. It\u2019s more sophisticated in styling, it\u2019s made for really all day wear, but it comes with a lot of the technologies that you would find in a performance running brand. So carbon plates, different foams, different more modern materials and cleaner lines, a little bit elevated price point above 200. And obviously, it\u2019s early days. We\u2019re excited to launch this into the market. I\u2019ll let you know the name as soon as I\u2019m allowed to, but stay tuned in the next few weeks, you\u2019ll hear about the soft launch and then we\u2019ll head into March and April in a more robust way and build from there.\nSam Poser: Thanks very much. Congratulations, again.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your last question comes on the line of Jonathan Komp from Baird. Please proceed.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, hi, thanks. Good afternoon. One more question on UGG. In a different forum, Dave, I think you recently highlighted long-term potential for UGG to still double revenue, potentially without a time frame attached. So, Dave or Stefano, could you maybe share any more insights, how you think about those comments in relation to the long-term opportunity for UGG? And then just separately on HOKA, can you share any retailer feedback on the new styles, thinking about the Cielo X, the Skyward X, the Skyflow, just what are you hearing, especially on some of the premium product you plan to bring out? And any thoughts on sustaining leadership or still growing and core run specialty while you eventually, thoughtfully expand distribution?\nDave Powers: Yes. I\u2019m going to let Stefano answer the HOKA question, then I\u2019ll come back to the first question.\nStefano Caroti: Yes. On the Cielo X launch, we launched today, literally. So it\u2019s a bit early to say how well it\u2019s doing [indiscernible] results, they\u2019re quite encouraging. But it\u2019s early days.\nDave Powers: Yes. And then regarding the UGG brand, I actually don\u2019t remember saying doubling the business at some point, but that\u2019s okay. I would say, listen, we still think this is \u2013 we see this more than ever as a growth brand. And we think that a healthy growth rate for this brand is mid-single-digits. And that\u2019s in line with managing our marketplace and growing effectively in a smart way. Does the brand have potential to be doubled at some point? Hey, I think if we optimize potential in men\u2019s and we start to build our apparel engine a little bit more, anything\u2019s possible. But right now we\u2019re taking this one year at a time and really strategically and methodically building it in line with our marketplace strategy.\nJonathan Komp: Okay, thanks for that. Just one more, if I could sneak it in for Steve. Any comments on what bonus or incentive accruals look like in 2024, given the strong performance and just how to think about that potentially year-over-year in a more normal year for 2025? Thanks.\nSteve Fasching: Yes. So good question. So clearly, with the performance that we\u2019ve got going on in FY2024, we are accruing for an increase in performance related compensation. That resets back to approved budget levels. So on percentage terms, we\u2019re not quantifying dollars, but on percentage terms, clearly the expectations a couple of months left, but given everything we\u2019ve seen so far, very strong performance. So there is an increase in performance related compensation in FY2024 and then we reset that for FY2025.\nJonathan Komp: Okay. Thank you all, again.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Jon.\nSteve Fasching: All right. Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to speak to the leadership announcement we made today. After 11 years at Deckers, I have decided to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1st. I will continue to serve as a member of the company's Board of Directors. On a personal note, after 30 years in this industry, I am looking forward to spending more time with my family, pursuing my other life passions, and exploring more ways in which I can make a positive impact on the world. Serving as CEO of Deckers has been a great honor, and it's a privilege to work with some of the best talent this industry has to offer. I am incredibly proud of our accomplishments and our unique culture built on doing good and doing great. Deckers continues to demonstrate exceptional performance, and we have a strong foundation from which to continue driving results, a deep bench of talent, and innovative products that are resonating with consumers globally. I believe it's a good time for us to make this transition. We're all thrilled that the Board has selected Stefano Caroti, our Chief Commercial Officer, as Deckers' next President and CEO, following a thorough succession planning process. Many of you know him already, but for those of you who don't, Stefano has an extensive industry and experience, and he seamlessly led our omni-channel regional and HOKA brand operations during some of Deckers' most pivotal years. He is passionate about Deckers and its values, and he has been a key member of the executive team, helping to craft and progress our consumer-focused marketplace strategy and our inclusive and engaged culture. I know Deckers will be in excellent hands with Stefano at the helm. Over the next six months, Stefano and I will continue to execute on Deckers' proven strategy. We're invigorated about this next phase of our work together and for Deckers' bright future. Now let's turn our attention to our Q3 performance. I'm glad to be here today discussing another record-breaking quarter for Deckers brands as our two leading brands continued bucking industry trends to deliver high-quality growth via full-price consumer demand. Key highlights of our record-breaking third quarter results include total company revenue increasing 16% to $1.56 billion, DTC revenue increasing 23%, representing a quarterly record 55% of total company revenue, total UGG revenue increasing 15% to achieve its first-ever billion dollar quarter, total HOKA revenue increasing 22% to $429 million, total company gross margins increasing over 500 basis points to an all-time quarterly high of 58.7%, and diluted earnings per share increasing 44% to $15.11. We believe the success of our brands and company as a whole continues to be the direct result of innovative product that is on trend and resonates with consumers across the globe, decision-making that is guided by our long-term strategic objectives, alignment between product creation, marketing, and omni-channel distribution that centers around the consumer, and the strong execution of our teams to deliver in real time while remaining focused on the longer-term vision of our marquee brand. We are thrilled by the success of this quarter, but I feel it's important to reflect on how these results represent a continuation of strong year-to-date performance as well as many years of careful strategic execution. Our brands are thinking long-term, and while we are happy to produce great quarterly results, we are even more pleased to see the consistency of performance. With the first three quarters of this fiscal year behind us, we believe we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth, which would be the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth in the mid-teens or higher. Highlights from the first nine months include global HOKA revenue growing 25% versus last year, led by a near 50% increase in DTC; global UGG revenue increasing 16% versus last year, led by international regions growing close to 30%, and global DTC increasing more than 20%; and total portfolio DTC revenue increasing 28% with robust growth in both consumer acquisition and retention. I am extremely proud of the collaboration across the Deckers organization to deliver these exceptional results through the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. We are creating remarkably distinct, relevant, and breakthrough product concepts that are deeply rooted in consumer insights and brand DNA. This is distinguishing our brands from the competition. Our strategic execution of brand and marketplace management, combined with our financial discipline, preserves Deckers' position of strength as we focus on closing out fiscal year 2024 and plan for the significant opportunity in the years ahead.  Steve will provide additional color on this quarter's financial performance and our related increased outlook for the full fiscal year, but in the meantime, let's dive into third quarter brand and channel highlights. Starting with UGG. Global UGG revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, representing a 15% increase versus the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by global DTC, which increased 20% in the quarter to represent 62% of total brand revenue, up from 60% last year, aided by international and domestic consumer acquisition increasing 14% and 8%, respectively, and retained consumers increasing 26% and 8% across international and domestic regions, respectively. In addition to driving a significant increase to gross margin, the outsized growth from DTC helped deliver a double-digit increase in the brand's consolidated global average selling price. As in general, DTC selling resulted in a much higher ASP and a favorable gross margin relative to the wholesale channel, UGG commended extraordinarily high levels of full-price selling, and the brand benefited from select price increases on a few of its most popular styles. The cohesion of product, marketing, and consumer targeting, in addition to a reduced SKU count, drove focused energy behind key styles, which has greatly contributed to the success UGG is experiencing this year. Recognizing that there was unmet consumer demand last year and capitalizing on the continued brand momentum driven by that scarcity, the UGG team invested in additional inventory to support its most popular product. Helping fuel brand heat and further the conversation with target consumers during the third quarter, UGG spearheaded meaningful collaborations, most notably with Palace Skateboards, selling out in minutes across key cities like New York, Los Angeles, London, and Tokyo, hosted pinnacle brand experience feel houses in New York, Paris, and Seoul, and launched the first of its kind UGGextreme capsule that features fashionable performance products capable of handling winter's most brutal conditions. These top-of-the-funnel brand activations, combined with community building and social listening across digital platforms, help UGG create positive brand buzz and increase opportunities for consumer connections that offer feedback in real-time. This year's coordination between DTC operations and product marketing on social channels elevated the launches of new styles or colors and brought greater traffic and attention to the brand when hot products were being restocked. From a regional standpoint, UGG has maintained high levels of brand heat and demand almost universally across the globe to deliver strong year-to-date growth across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Helping bolster UGG performance in the third quarter, the brand opened a couple of exciting new stores in key markets, including a Shanghai flagship, which offers one of the most contemporary visual expressions of UGG anywhere in the world, and the brand's first full-price location in Germany with a new Munich store. Both stores are performing extremely well. In Shanghai, we are seeing average transaction values that are approximately 20% above the average UGG store in China, as well as the conversion rate more than double that of the average. Though early days, the Munich store is experiencing ATVs that are 25% higher than the average European UGG store, with conversion rate well above that of the average UGG store in Germany. Similar to what we often see in markets where new stores opened, Germany's online business for UGG benefited from this additional consumer touchpoint, boasting both the highest online growth rate and highest conversion rate of any European country in the third quarter for the brand. We are pleased to see these new consumer touchpoints are helping produce positive results in key international markets, where we continue to see long-term opportunities for the UGG brand. The success UGG is now experiencing among international regions is a direct result of our thoughtful, multiyear marketplace management implementation that fostered the alignment of product creation, localized marketing content, and brand-enhancing distribution partners. With the momentum and brand heat UGG has created among international markets, we are even more excited about the global opportunities ahead. From a style perspective, UGG experienced growth and success with key franchises like the Tasman, Ultra Mini, and Classic Mini, including the fashion-oriented platform versions of each, as well as new introductions that include the Weather Hybrid Collection, Goldenstar Clog, and the Lowmel Sneaker. The Weather Hybrid Collection was positioned as a modern, weatherized update to a few of the UGG brand's most popular styles, including the Tasman, Neumel, and Classic Boot. Our PRR teams partnered with influential NBA star, Jaylen Brown, to highlight the launch, which helped this all-gender collection drive strong sell-through among all consumers. The Goldenstar Clog was somewhat of a surprise hit during the holiday season, as it was created to bolster the shoulder seasons outside of winter, complementing the rising Goldenstar Sandal. The Lowmel, which we see as the first unmistakably UGG sneaker, represented a continuation of our hybrid strategy to redefine categories through UGG DNA. We believe Tasman's adoption of the sneaker versus previously being purchased primarily as an indoor slipper, has given UGG permission to play in the sneaker category, in which the Lowmel performed extremely well, selling out quickly across the globe. Both the Goldenstar Clog and Lowmel have been positioned for expansion into this spring and next fall, as the UGG brand continues to build connections with consumers through a cohesive, year-round, product assortment. Through the first nine months of this fiscal year, UGG has delivered undeniably impressive results. The brand has driven exceptional growth in focus areas, including international regions and global DTC, and has done so by acquiring and retaining target consumers with full priced products. I'd like to congratulate and thank the entire UGG team for their hard work and collaboration that enabled the brand's success in the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date. Shifting to HOKA, global HOKA revenue in the third quarter was $429 million, representing a 22% increase versus the prior year. HOKA has continued to deliver consistent year-over-year growth and volume each quarter this year, reflecting the brand's balanced seasonality in year-round demand. Similar to what HOKA experienced in the first half, third quarter growth was primarily driven by gains in the DTC channel as intended, with HOKA diligently managing the wholesale marketplace to drive market share gains with high levels of full price sell through. More specifically on DTC performance, HOKA revenue in the channel increased 38% in Q3, representing over 40% of total brand revenue, which is 5 percentage points higher than last year. DTC growth has been driven by significant increases in consumer acquisition, with international and domestic experience growth of 50% and 27% respectively, and important gains in retained consumers, which increased 55% internationally and 33% in the U.S. The HOKA brand's DTC business has been strong in every single region this year, but has been particularly powerful in Europe and China, two regions where we have been emphasizing growth in the channel as brand awareness grows. Both regions have benefited from a greater retail presence. In Europe, HOKA opens its first retail location in Covent Garden, London, during the third quarter, which is performing exceptionally well, and the brand has a location planned to open in Paris in time for the Olympics. In China, HOKA has added four new company-owned locations throughout this year, in which the consumer experience has continued to improve, particularly with a greater focus on key stories and a new capsule collection of apparel that rounded out a compelling in-store product assortment. Complimenting the added stores in China, we continue to see our premiumization efforts online paying off, as HOKA has achieved high levels of full price sell through online, which is the channel that China generally uses for promotion activity. One example of this during the third quarter was China's annual Double 11 event, better known as Singles Day, which is a countrywide event that features widespread discounts across brands and product categories known for driving significant consumer traffic online. This year, HOKA benefited from the online traffic despite low levels of promotion and maintains strong full price selling, particularly in comparison to competitive brands. We are very encouraged by the increasing adoption of HOKA across international markets, particularly in the DTC channel, where we have been focusing our growth efforts while managing the wholesale environment to maintain high levels of full price sell through. We believe HOKA is still in the early stages of expansion internationally, as we continue to build brand awareness in key markets to establish HOKA as a major worldwide player in the performance space. Over in the U.S., where we also see a significant opportunity for growth, I want to take a moment to highlight an amazing event that HOKA had a huge impact on during the third quarter. HOKA was a presenting sponsor of the 44th Annual Foot Locker Cross Country National Championships, outfitting thousands of elite high school athletes with complementary footwear and apparel. This event was the center of the U.S. running world and media for three days, driving significant impressions and some of the highest brand engagement we have ever seen for HOKA. On the product front, HOKA continues to develop and refine a compelling assortment of performance products that enable athletes of all kinds to achieve their goals. This morning, HOKA announced the introduction of the all new Cielo X1 that sits atop the brand's assortment as the ultimate race day shoe for the most discerning athletes. The Cielo X1 was designed with insights and feedback from the HOKA brand's roster of elite athletes, incorporating the most advanced geometry, foam compounds, and plate technologies to enable record setting results. Before it was even commercially available, the Cielo X1 has already made its podium debut as HOKA NAZ Elite member Kellyn Taylor won the Rock \u2018n' Roll San Jose Half Marathon wearing the Cielo X1, qualifying her for the 2024 Olympics Marathon Trials for Team USA. Beyond the brand's pinnacle performance product, HOKA is also experiencing success with exciting lifestyle-oriented products. These products feature the same quality and comfort expected from a performance HOKA shoe, but are packaged in an everyday wear aesthetic for more versatile wearing occasions. The HOKA transport has become the brand's go-to casual shoe, now sitting within the brand's top 10 best sellers. The HOKA brand's captivating collaborations are also furthering its resonance with the lifestyle consumer. They are designed to reach a new audience by partnering with logical yet unexpected brands. Most recently, HOKA partnered with Satisfy Running, a French running apparel brand, to co-create an exciting new take on the Clifton LS, which sold out almost instantly. Highlighting the partnerships theme of highs and lows, Satisfy created a one-of-a-kind community experience that brought together the skateboard, trail, and running communities to join in a sprint down the steep hills of San Francisco. As we continue building HOKA for the long-term, our focus is to remain a top brand in road running, expanding with innovative performance footwear, become a dominant off-road player with disruptive trail and hike products, and bring the HOKA experience to the lifestyle consumer while keeping the brand rooted in performance. While we are at different stages of this journey across domestic and international markets, we see significant global opportunities ahead with this powerful brand. We are proud of the consistent momentum HOKA is achieving around the world. Our efforts to build brand awareness and drive high full price sell-through continue to bear fruit and have set the stage for a strong finish to the year with another record quarter. Now moving to our discussion of consolidated channel performance. During the third quarter, performance remained strong across both DTC and wholesale. However, in line with our strategic objectives, DTC remained the fastest growing channel, increasing 23% versus last year to represent a record 55% of the quarter's revenue, up from 52% in the prior year. DTC success continues to be broad-based across brands with HOKA and UGG DTC increasing 38% and 20% respectively, regions with international and domestic DTC increasing 40% and 16% respectively, and consumers with acquired and retained increasing 13% and 16% respectively across all brands. In addition, as discussed, we are also experiencing strong engagement with our brands both online and in store, reflecting the quality of our omni-channel operations and ability to provide a consistent consumer experience. Furthering the success of DTC, we continue to see a double-digit increase in the average selling price through the third quarter, driven by a greater mix of HOKA which carries the highest ASP in the portfolio, higher UGG full price selling, including benefits from select price increases and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. With respect to consolidated wholesale performance, third quarter revenue increased 9% versus last year with domestic HOKA and UGG contributing the majority of the incremental dollar volume. We are very pleased with this strong wholesale result, especially considering the tight marketplace management we have been focused on executing during this fiscal year. As a result of these efforts, our brands drove high levels of full price sell through, entering calendar 2024 with lean channel inventories that have created opportunities for market share gains going forward. Thanks, everyone, and now I'll hand the call over to Steve to provide more specifics on third quarter performance and an update to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Thanks, Steve. We are extremely proud of our brand's year-to-date performance, which have produced record revenue and earnings results. As we look beyond fiscal year 2024, I believe we have an incredibly strong innovation pipeline for the UGG and HOKA brands, giving us further confidence in our ability to build upon this year's exceptional growth. Thinking into the next few years, we believe HOKA remains our primary growth vehicle with considerable opportunity for both region and category expansion as awareness of the brand's innovative performance product increases further, and continue to position UGG for growth through the development of category hybrids that celebrate heritage brand codes to resonate with target consumers across global markets. Deckers strategic focus on marketplace management, omnichannel strategy and flexible operating model continues to be the driving force behind our sustained success. We remain focused on executing against our long-term objectives while continuing to deliver high levels of profitability and driving shareholder value. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our employees across the organization for their consistent and dedicated focus to driving results aligned with our long-term strategic vision. Our employees continue to go above and beyond while upholding Deckers values. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to give Stefano a moment to say a few words. Stefano? Thanks, Stefano, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to sharing more next quarter as we continue to build towards Deckers exciting future. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes, very happy to answer that question. And first of all, I apologize, my voice is a little rough, I'm fighting a cold at the moment. But yes, HOKA we had a great quarter for HOKA Q3, as you're hoping the results right on plan, right on strategy. And the teams continue to execute at a level globally. And Q4, it's a combination of things. There's a lot of refill orders that will be going into wholesale fulfilling that demand and getting back in stock as we head into spring. And then as we mentioned before, we have some really exciting new product launches that are coming out in Q4 as well as planned. So continue to be very strong momentum executing on the strategy. Q4 is looking solid for us. No new doors at the end of the year, no net new doors. We'll continue to evaluate that based on how the market performs and how HOKA sells through. And we're very pleased and optimistic about this quarter ahead. Yes. Well, it's a good question, right? I mean, our history has been a little bit volatile. But listen, I think this is a new era for UGG. We have an incredible new leadership team. The innovation pipeline is resonating incredibly well with our global consumers. We're expanding categories beyond our core icon styles and the momentum is real. This is the most exciting quarter I've ever seen for UGG with regard to global brand heat, global sell-through every region, every channel is performing well with the UGG brand right now. And we were light on inventory. We have an incredible quarter of growth, but there's still opportunity. And we're going into this coming fall with a position of real strength with healthy inventory levels, clean marketplace. We had some price increases that didn't slow us down. And we still think there's a lot of demand out there to be had. Across the women's, especially a lot of the icons that we were successful in this year. But with some new introductions like the Lowmel, the Weather Hybrids in men's, we think there's a lot of upside still for this brand. And we're going to stay the course and manage this marketplace incredibly tight as we have been and prioritize DTC and that formula continues to pay off major dividends for us. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Yes, Laurent. Good question. So with regards to long-term strategy, I think, it's important to stress, it's particularly with [indiscernible] coming up, that we are still focused on what we've talked about before. So, Stefano and I are sitting here saying, hey, there is a major change that needs to happen. It's more about continuing the momentum that, quite frankly, Stefano and his team have helped create. So the targets that we spoke about before, those are ranges that we've talked about. We think there's potential to get there. It's not a hard target. But the strategy is in place. We have \u2013 we have that \u2013 the way we're managing the marketplace and the way they're presenting these brands in the market to our consumers, where we're connecting with our consumers just gives us more confidence, especially coming out of a quarter like this, that those targets are achievable. And I think this \u2013 the quarterly results represented great examples of how we're migrating closer to DTC and more business through DTC and then building more heat for these brands over time. So as we get more consumers into the fold, that will continue, and we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity for HOKA, but also for UGG at the same time. So stay the course, lots to get after still, particularly with the strength of the international markets coming on now, and we're confident we can get there. Yeah, and with regards to UGG coming up into fall of 2024, we're confident. We see UGG now as a growth brand within the portfolio. Will it be double-digit, 15%, like we just experienced? We won't be planning for that, but we still think there is growth to be added. I think it's important to remind folks that UGG is in a very different position than it has been in the past. And I talked about this in the last call. We used to sell primarily Classics, Classic Short, Classic Tall, different colors, iterations, and a few slippers to go with that, and the distribution was pretty similar across the marketplace. UGG is much more diversified now, we're selling boots, we're selling slippers, we're selling new hybrid innovations, and we're starting to sell our version of sneakers. And it's a younger consumer. It's a more diverse consumer. We have segmentation in the marketplace globally. We have a lot of untapped potential in the international markets, and we're going to continue to play this through with the strength of our product innovation pipeline and the strength of our marketing teams to continue to drive this as a growth brand for years to come. All right. Thanks, buddy. Yes, I don't have the exact specifics on that, but I will say the core Classics are really just a maintained business at this point, so it's not like we're purposely trying to shrink those. Those are still healthy. We are just managing that category and that product better in the marketplace. But the growth is coming from some of the newness, the Taz, the platform style, the Ultra Mini, and then, like I said, some of the sneaker versions and the hybrid winter programs. And as you notice, we launched UGGextreme, which is our first serious foray into more performance products. So this is a brand that has really broad shoulders. I have always said that. And I think now we're seeing, once we get the right design DNA into these categories that are really innovative and distinct, there's really nothing like this product in the marketplace. We have a lot of runway and so we're going to continue to innovate, continue to attack these categories with a focused assortment of UGG DNA products and connect with our consumers in a segmented way. And I think there is still a tremendous upside there. So lots to be confident with the UGG brand. I think this is an indication of the new leadership that Anne has brought to the team and the discipline in the marketplace, as well as our innovation pipeline. And we're optimistic this is going to continue at a healthy pace going forward. I'll let Steve answer that real quick. Yes, and the last thing I would say, if you think about this brand five years ago, it was a boot brand. And we've had that stigma attached to UGG brand for quite some time. And I think that those days are in the past. We have products that is resonating in different categories that we've never had before. And I'm really excited about the Lowmel, that it's our version of a sneaker. And I think that's going to be a best seller for years to come and start potentially taking share from some of the sneaker brands out there. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes. Thanks, Janine, and great question. We are and we have been and will do continue to look at prices strategically. And so some of the decisions we made this year were really just on a handful of styles in UGG. But in really, some of our bestsellers who are proved to be our bestsellers. So that's why you saw the exponential impact of revenue on some of those styles as they perform so well at full price in the added $5 or $10 made a big difference on a lot of units. Going forward, we'll continue to evaluate it. We don't see massive price increase in broad base this fall. We're still evaluating that, but it'll be selected by market and style if we do that. And then the same approach for HOKA, we're comfortable with prices are right now we think we are providing incredible value for the dollar. There's opportunities to raise prices a little bit here and there as we continue to roll out more innovation. But pricing \u2013 growth through pricing is not a strategy of ours, it's pricing the appropriate the product in the market for the consumer, and that'll drive our decision. Yes. Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Sam. I appreciate that. I wouldn't say that we're forcing more inventory purposely away from wholesale into DTC. What I would say is I think the teams have gotten better at allocating the right amount of inventory for our stores, so that we're not missing sales when the customer comes in. And we've been guilty of that in the last few years, not having protected some of the inventory in this kind of demand. Some of that inventory can get sucked up by DTC or wholesale fill-ins, so we're protecting it better than we have for our stores and just making sure that we're balancing out across wholesale and retail and e-commerce as best we can for the consumer and how they like to shop. Just so happens, though, when you have this kind of brand heat momentum, if there are wholesale partners that are running low on inventory, they're going to go to our stores to find it and our websites to find it. And this is an indication of what happened, but it's also a strong indication of how well our pull model is working. And we have a pull model like that, it does help generally benefit your DTC business a little bit more. Yes. Well, I will say, it's exciting for us. We established this Deckers Lab innovation engine a few years ago with the help of Jean-Luc, who is one of the co-founders of HOKA. And that has been quietly building as a force for our pipeline for all of our brands. So some of the innovation you're seeing in UGG and HOKA, and we'll soon see some of that in Teva as well, has come from that. And one of the things we uncover is there's an opportunity for a new kind of sneaker brand. So we would put this under the category of super sneaker brand. It's pretty exciting. It's more sophisticated in styling, it's made for really all day wear, but it comes with a lot of the technologies that you would find in a performance running brand. So carbon plates, different foams, different more modern materials and cleaner lines, a little bit elevated price point above 200. And obviously, it's early days. We're excited to launch this into the market. I'll let you know the name as soon as I'm allowed to, but stay tuned in the next few weeks, you'll hear about the soft launch and then we'll head into March and April in a more robust way and build from there. Thank you. Yes. I'm going to let Stefano answer the HOKA question, then I'll come back to the first question. Yes. And then regarding the UGG brand, I actually don't remember saying doubling the business at some point, but that's okay. I would say, listen, we still think this is \u2013 we see this more than ever as a growth brand. And we think that a healthy growth rate for this brand is mid-single-digits. And that's in line with managing our marketplace and growing effectively in a smart way. Does the brand have potential to be doubled at some point? Hey, I think if we optimize potential in men's and we start to build our apparel engine a little bit more, anything's possible. But right now we're taking this one year at a time and really strategically and methodically building it in line with our marketplace strategy. Thanks, Jon."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance exceeded expectations and demonstrated the continued strength of our brands. As Dave mentioned, UGG delivered strong growth in the quarter as exceptional brand heat continued to capture consumers globally and we were able to meet incremental demand through our DTC channel in the quarter with expedited shipments of the brand's most popular styles. HOKA drove another quarter of solid growth led by the DTC channel as we continued to diligently manage the wholesale marketplace, all while driving high levels of full price sell through. These results are a testament to the exceptional demand for our brands as our compelling and innovative product offerings continue to resonate with consumers globally during the holiday season and well beyond, helping drive phenomenal performance. Our disciplined operating approach and robust financial profile have continued to enable our brands and company to execute a strategy that delivers strong results while keeping us positioned to achieve our commitment to driving success over the long-term. Now, let's get to the specifics of the third quarter financial performance. Third quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.56 billion, representing an increase of 16% versus prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 15% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels delivering $1.07 billion of revenue, with global DTC increasing 20% as brand heat remains robust with all DTC regions exhibiting a double-digit percentage growth in the period and continued strong demand across the HOKA ecosystem of access points with particular strength in the DTC channel, which increased 38% versus last year, contributing to the brand's total revenue of $429 million in the quarter. Notably, HOKA's DTC performance for the quarter was aided by global increases in consumer acquisition, which was up 31% versus last year, and consumer retention, which was up 35% versus last year. Additionally, I would note that this quarter's revenue growth was aided by a higher percentage of full price selling as well as the UGG brand select price increases, both of which contributed to dollar growth outpacing unit growth. While we will always manage our brands with the intent to deliver high levels of full price selling, the level we experienced this year, particularly for UGG in its peak season is one we don't expect will always repeat. This dynamic combined with a larger than expected impact from price increases due to the strength of performance from affected styles is part of the catalyst for our increased full year expectations for UGG growth. Gross margins for the quarter was 58.7%, which was up 580 basis points from last year's 53%. As compared to last year, gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher mix of UGG full price selling, freight savings, select pricing action and favorable brand and product mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. While we are exceptionally proud of these remarkable results, we remain mindful that the outsized margin expansion seen this quarter is above normalized levels and is not something we anticipate will repeat to the same degree. While we do see opportunities to continue to deliver top tier profitability through our key strategies, items that we anticipate may not repeat in a normalized environment include the extremely low levels of promotional activity achieved for our two major brands, considerable benefits from UGG pricing actions and very low freight costs that are now on the rise, as well as other potential macroeconomic factors such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. SG&A dollar spend in the third quarter was $429 million, up 23% versus last year's $350 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 150 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to investment in talent to support key functions within our growing organization and higher marketing spend. Our tax rate was 21.9%, which is lower than last year's 23.7%. These results, combined with favorable interest income relative to last year and a lower share count, drove record diluted earnings per share of $15.11, which compares to last year's $10.48 diluted earnings per share representing EPS growth of 44%. Turning to our balance sheet. At December 31, 2023, we ended this fiscal third quarter with $1.65 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $539 million, down 25% versus the same point in time last year, and during the period, we had no outstanding borrowings. On inventory, specifically, I'd note that with the strong levels of selling that we have seen this year, we are now below normal operating levels for the current size of our organization. And heading into next year, we expect to see incremental inventory investment to keep up with growth. Today's inventory position reflects the upside that has already been captured in the quarter just completed, which could have a small impact on sales in the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares at an average price of $507.95. As of December 31, 2023, the company had approximately $1.05 billion remaining authorized for share repurchase. Now moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2024. Based on the strong demand experienced in the third quarter, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to be approximately $4.15 billion, up from our previous guidance of approximately $4.025 billion. This increase now equates to full year growth expectations of approximately 14% versus last year. From a brand perspective, we now expect UGG revenue growth of low double digits up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits. This full year increase is the result of the strong DTC demand that we experienced and fulfilled in the third quarter. Full year HOKA revenue growth of approximately 25%, with strong third quarter sell-through driving wholesale refill upside in the fourth quarter, reflecting our disciplined marketplace management. In addition to our fiscal year 2024 updated revenue outlook, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 54.5%. As UGG experienced high levels of full price selling, including Key Styles contributing incremental margin from price increases as brand heat continued to drive strong demand. SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be approximately 34.5% as we have identified areas to accelerate spend in Q4 with revenue growth exceeding expectations for fiscal year 2024. We believe this additional spend, part of which represents top-of-funnel marketing opportunities, gives our brands the opportunity to defend their current positions of strength, setting the foundation for the future. Additionally, I would note that some of the third and fourth quarter spending timing dynamics related to unrealized FX gains recorded in Q3 that we expect will be offset in Q4 as rates have recently moved in the opposite direction. With these updates, we are increasing our operating margin for the year and now expect it to be approximately 20%, reflecting the improvement in gross margin experienced. Our effective tax rate is now projected to be approximately 22%. And finally, with these updates, we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectations to now be in the range of $26.25 to $26.50. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered onetime in nature and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate. This guidance update represents a $3.25 increase on the prior top end of our diluted earnings per share guidance range. Based on the success that we've seen this year with strong sell-through and high levels of full price selling, there are a few business dynamics related to the fourth quarter that we would like to highlight, including U.S. wholesale shipments that went out at the tail end of the third quarter of this year that have historically occurred in the fourth quarter. Meaningful revenue from UGG closeouts last year that will not repeat this year and low levels of inventory on Key Styles that have been driving the business this fiscal year. We, of course, still expect to deliver a strong fourth quarter that is now projected to round out Deckers fourth consecutive year of at least mid-teens top line revenue growth, while also consistently delivering exceptional high levels of operating profitability. We would note that some of the benefit to our operating profitability we're seeing are outsized and may not repeat in future years, but we remain dedicated to delivering operating profitability in the top tier among our peer group even as we continue to invest in our organization to enable future growth. As we've said in the past, if revenue growth comes faster than our ability to keep pace with investments, some of the related profit expansion may flow through to the bottom line near term. However, we continue to recognize the importance of funding our strategic initiatives moving into next year and maintain a focus on the long-term vision for our brands. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach as we enter our final fiscal quarter and begin planning for next fiscal year. Our largest brands are two of the healthiest and most in demand in our industry. With a robust balance sheet and our diligent operating approach, we are well positioned to drive future success and look forward to providing more details on our year-end call. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yes, Tom. And just to add to that, this is Steve. I think the \u2013 as we look at the success that we had in Q3, this is where our marketplace management works. We are containing that wholesale channel. We're lowing some of the demand over to our DTC channel. And this is really where you're seeing the power of that work. You see it with the gross margin expansion. And so that's a model that we're going to continue to reinforce next year. And we know we're leaving demand on the table and that's by design. So we continue to build D-to-C brands by controlling that marketplace distribution, lowing some of that excess over into D-to-C, and leaving some demand on the table. Yes. Yes, so I'll start, Laurent. In terms of some of the shifts, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is, yes, we are seeing where some of the over performance of Q3, because again, as you know, we haven't guided orders, where we did see some earlier wholesale deliveries in Q3. That's slightly impacting our Q4. In terms of our full year, we have raised our full year and that's really a reflection of the strength that we've seen in Q3. Because we haven't given quarterly guidance, I know everybody's models may be a little bit different. And so it's hard to say specifically kind of how you're looking at it. The way we've looked at it is some of the business that we thought may happen in Q4 did come at us in Q3 as the sell-through was very strong. And so we took advantage of that, and we were able to kind of shift some of that price. Generally speaking, what you're seeing is the business has performed better than what we expected. We have flowed that through on our full year lift, and we're seeing Q4 kind of as we've seen it with a little bit of timing issues [ph]. But overall, I think, the takeaway is incredible performance in Q3. We've flowed that through, we've lifted our full year, business is incredibly strong, and the demand for our brands is there. Yes Jay, it's a good question. Clearly the addressable market, it has grown from where we were five years ago. I think another way to look at it, and I know what you're trying to kind of get at is what's the future growth opportunities for UGG? I think what we've seen, especially in this last year, is how UGG is being adopted for different use cases than it was five years ago. And so that total addressable market continues to increase as we are seeing greater adoption around our product. And so to Dave's point about what we're excited about, what we saw in Q3, is we're seeing heritage products resonate with consumers, but iterations of that, where we've created newness in categories that consumers are adopting. And so we've also talked about some of the demographic reach, and we're seeing a younger demographic come into the brand with a strong excitement. You've really seen that come through in Q3. It's what's driving some of that DTC performance. And then we're seeing it grow internationally. So as you recall, five years ago, we talked about how we were going to deliver the progress in North America and then export that success to the international market. And now what you're seeing is those international markets growing at a faster rate, albeit smaller dollars, but at a faster rate on percentage terms than we're seeing domestic. And that shows you how the consumer is embracing the UGG brand across the globe in different use cases. And through the last couple of years, what we've learned is through some of this casualization, the adoption of UGG for different use cases. And we're continuing to see that demand grow, and that's what gives us excitement about where we can go with this brand. Yes. And Janine, just to add a little bit on that, as Dave said, it was not across the Board. It was very surgical in terms of units that we identified had the potential to absorb a price increase without much consumer resistance to it. And that was significant. And so it was not a lot of styles, it was on styles that we knew would do well. And so it was surgical in the sense of, those high performing styles, and it drove a big portion. So just in terms of quantified a little bit, in the quarter, our gross margin from last year was at 580 basis points. I think the other thing that was a big contributor along with price increases, we didn't get promotional. This was a full, strong, price, sell-through quarter for us. So of that 580 basis points, about 340 of it came from not being promotional, and the price increases that we experienced in the quarter. So a big dry growth quarter [ph]. And as Dave said, we're not looking to decrease in this to kind of continue to drive that. We're going to be very careful about how we place price increases and how we contemplate it. But this year was one year that we benefited from it that we will not necessarily see in future periods. Yes. Yes. So good question. So clearly, with the performance that we've got going on in FY2024, we are accruing for an increase in performance related compensation. That resets back to approved budget levels. So on percentage terms, we're not quantifying dollars, but on percentage terms, clearly the expectations a couple of months left, but given everything we've seen so far, very strong performance. So there is an increase in performance related compensation in FY2024 and then we reset that for FY2025. All right. Thanks, Jon."

During my tenure here, I have had the chance to grow with Deckers, as we've made significant strides building beautiful and innovative brands that resonate with consumers around the world. I understand and appreciate the immense effort it has taken to get us where we are today. And I'm passionate about our people, our organization and the continuation of our collective success. I believe Deckers is well positioned to continue cutting through a highly competitive marketplace and take advantage of the many opportunities ahead with the support of our dedicated management team and all the good people at Deckers. Over the next six months, I look forward to working with Dave, who has become a great mentor, colleague and friend to continue executing on our strategy and ensure a smooth transition. Thanks, Dave. Back to you. Thanks, Laurent. Yes, then, Laurent, kind of on the operating margin, and we've talked about this before on prior calls. The way we look at the business is kind of a high teen margin business. And as I've said in the past is when we have an opportunity, when the business runs so well and delivers margins above that like we've seen in Q3, we will let some of that margin run through. We're not out just to spend money for the sake of spending money. We carefully watch where we're placing our investments. And when we see the opportunities to invest, we will take that. And that's the way we approach kind of every year. In a given year where we're seeing such strong full price selling, like we did this year where our brands and product are in such demand, it's a perfect case where we can flow through some of that. You've seen that in prior years, but at the same time, as we've indicated in our full year outlook, where we've raised it, we're also looking at where we can continue to invest in our brands because we know the competition is stepping up as well. So this provides us an opportunity that when we are performing well, we'll pass through some of that. But at the same time, we're looking at the long-term health of the business and we'll make the right investments to continue to drive this business forward in the long run. So that's our approach. That's not going to change. It's working for us and you can kind of see how that's driving these types of results. Yes. On the Cielo X launch, we launched today, literally. So it's a bit early to say how well it's doing [indiscernible] results, they're quite encouraging. But it's early days."

It's great to be here with you today to discuss our exceptional second quarter, where our two marquee brands experienced high levels of full-price consumer demand, leading to revenue increasing 25% versus last year, eclipsing $1 billion for the first time in our September-ending quarter, gross margin improving 520 basis points versus last year and diluted earnings per share increasing nearly 80% versus last year to $6.82. Our direct-to-consumer business was the fastest-growing component of revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing nearly 40% versus last year, with HOKA growing 46% and UGG increasing 38% as both brands experienced a greater than 30% global increase in consumer acquisition. Our global wholesale business also put up strong revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing 19% versus last year, again driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA. Our wholesale accounts also continue to see incredible heat and momentum for our key styles across both brands. With this strong consumer demand, selling for wholesale in the quarter included some accelerated fall seasonal shipments, benefiting our first-half results, and increasing our confidence to achieve our outlook for the fiscal year. As we continue to focus on our strategic marketplace management, we are pleased to have captured this strong momentum of demand early in the year, particularly with these products capturing high levels of full-price selling across all channels. As we focus on delivering the full-year, I think it's important to reflect on our year-to-date performance. We closed out a record first-half for Deckers, with total portfolio revenue across all channels growing 19% versus last year, driven by HOKA revenue increasing 27% from global strength across its ecosystem of access points, UGG revenue increasing 18% primarily from gains across international regions and global DTC, total portfolio global DTC acquisition and retention increasing 29% and 27% respectively, and international revenue across all brands increasing 23% versus last year. While Steve will provide further details on our financial performance and related increased outlook later in the call, I'd like to emphasis how proud we are of the continued alignment of our strong near-term performance with Deckers' long-term objectives to build HOKA into a multibillion dollar performance brand, grow UGG through direct-to-consumer connections with elevated products and experiences, expand DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains, and drive international growth through targeted investments. With that, let's get into the highlights of our successful first-half, starting with HOKA. Global revenue in the first-half increased 27% versus last year. This impressive result reflects the HOKA brand's successful marketplace management execution, which is driving more business to DTC in conjunction with market share gains from high full-price sale through at our existing points of wholesale distribution. HOKA revenue growth in the first-half was led by direct-to-consumer, which increased 54% versus last year, and represented 38% of revenue, up from 31% in the prior year. This was aided by global increases in brand awareness according to Deckers proprietary brand tracker study, consumer acquisition, which is up 47% versus last year; and consumer retention, which is up 52% versus the prior year, HOKA experienced significant growth in awareness across all major markets, with the U.S. growing to approximately 30%, and international regions, on average, rising to mid teens with much more room to grow. Specific to our gains in DTC in the first-half, consumer acquisition in EMEA DTC nearly doubled to help achieve a 75% year-over-year increase in channel revenue for the region. This represents great progress for our EMEA region. And though DTC remains a relatively small percentage of its total revenue, we see this expansion as a positive indictor that HOKA is increasingly resonating with the European consumer. As we have demonstrated in the U.S., thoughtfully building brand awareness through marketing activations and strategic marketplace presence served as a catalyst to DTC acceleration as the brand begins to take hold with the local consumer. To that end, HOKA recently opened its first European flagship store in Covent Garden in London, giving the brand a powerful presence in one of the most influential footwear markets around the world. In the U.S., HOKA continues to deliver exceptional growth. DTC revenue increased nearly 50% versus last year for the first-half, with strong growth among 18- to 34-year-old retained consumers, which increased 70%. We believe some of this demand was fueled by HOKA having increased resonance in the back-to-school timeframe with college-age students. Brand loyalty among this group is especially exciting given the increased potential lifetime value of repeat purchases. The HOKA marketing teams have done an exceptional job building global brand awareness through compelling Fly Human Fly campaign content, connecting with consumers at HOKA-sponsored events, and highlighting the incredible performances of HOKA athletes. We continue to sponsor key running events around the globe as part of our commitment to support the sport and provide a platform to showcase our innovative performance products. This includes events from 5ks to elite ultramarathons for all types of athletes around the world, allowing us to elevate the brand with pinnacle performance-minded consumers and also to broaden worldwide awareness of the achievements capable in HOKA products. This year's HOKA-sponsored UTMB or Ultra-Trail Mont-Blanc World Series Finals, held in Chamonix, France, is the perfect example of our team's 360-degree collaborative approach to building HOKA brand awareness and performance credibility. This trail running event allows us to celebrate the roots of HOKA, which was born in the French Alps, further connecting the brand with European consumers. At the UTMB World Series Finals, the HOKA team set up a base camp that offered consumers the opportunity to engage with the brand in a unique way through athlete meet-and-greets, 24-hour product testing, and shoe personalization. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the experience, and are already looking forward to leveraging these learnings at future events. HOKA made its mark on the event, both from a product and athlete performance standpoint, with several impressive achievements, including HOKA athlete Jim Walmsley making history becoming the first American man to win the Dacia UTMB, a 106-mile race that included more than six miles of elevation gain, completing the course in a record time of less than 20 hours. HOKA raking top among all brands with the most top-five finishes across the series of three races, and HOKA remaining the number one brand worn by UTMB participants. From a product standpoint, first-half HOKA growth was driven by a variety of categories and styles, which includes, among others; the Clifton franchise which benefited from the ninth addition launch as well as new successful lifestyle versions with suede uppers, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota franchises, the latter of which launched its fifth edition during the second quarter as we are seeing increased adoption of this category from consumers; trail and hike favorites, the Challenger and Anacapa franchises benefiting from new innovations incorporated in recent updates; speed shoes highlighted by the Rocket X Refresh and the all-new Mach X; and new lifestyle options including the popular Solimar and Transport styles. We remain encouraged by the breadth of category adoption across the innovative HOKA product assortment, which continues to evolve and attract new consumers to the brand. We are implementing greater segmentation across the ecosystem of HOKA Access Points to ensure our accounts are best positioned to serve their respective consumers and emphasize DTC as the pinnacle destination to experience the full depth of the brand's product offering. For the balance of the year, the HOKA team remains focused on executing its Marketplace Management Strategy which includes a focus on building global brand awareness and heat to increase demand which is helping to drive high full price sell-through at DTC and across wholesale allowing the brand to deliver healthy growth with best-in-class margins and inventory turns. Complemented by several new innovative product launches coming up in our fourth quarter, we expect HOKA to continue delivering strong results for the remainder of this fiscal year and well beyond. Now shifting to UGG, global revenue in the first-half increased 18% versus last year. The brand's strong first-half performance was driven primarily by high levels of brand heat, disciplined Marketplace Management leading to product scarcity on key styles exiting last Fall, and intentional pull forward of the brand's Fall marketing campaign relative to past years. We currently have the most cohesive globally aligned product, marketing, and consumer targeting strategy I've ever seen for UGG. Marketplace Management has been a core strength of the UGG brand for some time now. The allocation and segmentation of core and popular new styles continues to serve the brand well helping drive high levels of full price sell-through. Last year we shared that we did not fully capture demand on several key styles. As we began this fiscal year, we strategically developed targeted inventory that caters to the brand's most popular products and seeded the Fall marketing campaign, field Like UGG, in July as opposed to the typical September timeframe. From July 15th to August 15th, we saw a groundswell of influencer public service announcements reminding consumers to buy UGG now. Videos using hashtag UGG's received over 25 million views during that timeframe, and UGG saw twice the level of engagement on Instagram as compared to last year. We believe the UGG Team's strategic marketing shift served as a catalyst for earlier Fall consumer demand globally. In the U.S. specifically, this shift helped fuel greater back-to-school demand, with search interest increasing 46% versus last year, according to Google Trends. To keep this momentum going, at the tail end of September, UGG celebrated the official kickoff of hashtag UG season. with music superstar Cardi B, whose video announcement featuring the new classic dipper had nearly 20 million views. This resulted in significant press and media coverage of our launch, with influential publications such as Billboard and Vogue featuring UGG. Brand Heat, created by the UGG team, directly translated to incredible first-half results, particularly from the global DTC business and international regions, which both experienced a revenue increase of above 25% versus last year. Furthermore, UGG gross margins benefited from transitional and Fall products selling at full price during the second quarter. This dynamic is in contrast with prior years, with the brand's DTC business has historically been more weighted towards end of Spring and summer products that generally carry a lower average selling price. The Tasman franchise, including the Taz platform as well as the classic mini and ultra mini franchises have been the focal products of UGG's search interest and revenue growth in the first-half as expected. We are also excited that some of the new Fall franchises are beginning to resonate with consumers as well, including the aforementioned Classic Dipper, a key globally marketed style, the all gender hybrid weather collection, which includes modernized weather ready versions of the Tasman and Neumel, and the Lowmel, a sneaker hybrid take on the original Neumel. UGG is well positioned to capture consumer demand during the holiday season with great products like these. Considering the demand we've seen thus far, we are already in chase mode for a select group of popular items and colors, for which we are expediting production to ensure greater DTC inventory through the season. The UGG brand's first-half growth sets us up well, especially when factoring the signals of a weakening global economy and lower consumer confidence. Given this dynamic, we are glad to have captured some demand earlier to help reduce the pressure of competing with more promotional brands during this upcoming holiday season, as we see to continue selling premium UGG products at full price. Moving on to our discussion of consolidated channel performance, global growth was across both direct-to-consumer and wholesale, with DTC being the primary driver of revenue gains in the first-half, increasing 37% versus last year. Our portfolio experienced DTC strength relative to last year across consumers with acquired and retained increasing 29% and 27% respectively, brands with HOKA and UGG revenue increasing 54% and 26% respectively, regions with international and domestic revenue increasing 48% and 34% respectively, and channels as consumer demand was robust in stores and online. Additionally, we saw a double-digit increase in average selling price as a result of a greater mix of HOKA, higher full-price selling for UGG combined with a focus on fewer proven SKUs and more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Regarding global wholesale, revenue in the first-half increased 11% versus last year, growth was driven by strength in UGG and HOKA as well as across both our domestic and international regions. Market share gains continue to be the primary avenue of wholesale growth for HOKA, which is now the top-selling brand in U.S.-run specialty stores in aggregate, according to third-party market sources. HOKA has also quickly become the top-running brand with key strategic partners in applicable doors. Our teams are extremely proud of the HOKA brand's top market share achievement, which further validates the brand's performance-rooted credibility. UGG wholesale performance in the first-half is right in line with our strategy this year, with international regions fueling the majority of growth, while the brand maintains its strong business in the U.S. With these first-half results, it is clear that our marketplace management strategies are working well, positioning our brands to excel during the holiday quarter and capture increased consumer demand across their respective ecosystems of access points. Before I hand it off to Steve to discuss our results in more detail, I'll note that we also announced our plan to divest Sanuk. At Deckers, we're focused on the most effective allocation of our resources that are in alignment with long-term objectives. Consumers have long valued Sanuk for its fun, innovative, and comfort-first products. Over the coming months, we will work to find the right owner to support the brand's next chapter while we continue to execute our growth priorities. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand it over to Steve.\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We are excited by the strong performance HOKA and UGG continued to exhibit through the first-half of fiscal year 2024, stemming from our strategic marketplace management execution that continues to benefit our brands. As Dave covered, HOKA drove another quarter of strong growth led by DTC, while UGG demonstrated broad-based growth across regions and channels by continuing to captivate consumers and elevate its presence around the world. Our record second quarter revenue exemplifies the exceptional demand for our brands, and we look forward to continuing this momentum as we enter our largest and most complex fiscal quarter. While ongoing macroeconomic challenges persist, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate this dynamic marketplace. With a strong financial framework and in-demand brands, we remain committed to building the foundation for success that drives long-term sustainable growth. Now, let's get into the details of second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.092 billion, representing an increase of 25% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 24% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong demand experienced across the HOKA DTC channel, which increased 46% versus last year, and contributed to delivering total brand revenue of $424 million for the quarter and broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels, delivering $610 million of revenue, with global DTC increasing 38% and wholesale increasing 25%. With the HOKA brand's performance consistent with our expectation, the outsized UGG growth in the second quarter benefited from, first, a higher level of wholesale shipments in Q2 this year than in the past couple of years were captured in the first quarter, as transit times have reduced, supply chain logistics have improved, and availability of inventory is more consistent relative to during the pandemic. Second, seeding the fall global UGG campaign earlier in the quarter, reminding consumers of the scarcity that took place in the prior year, which created brand heat and demand for those same popular styles that sold out quickly last year, driving earlier consumer purchasing this year. And third, an increased level of demand for the brand during the back-to-school period, which signaled some wholesalers to desire shipments on an accelerated timeframe relative to our original plan. Gross margin for the second quarter was 53.4%, up 520 basis points from last year's 48.2%. Second quarter gross margin benefited from lower ocean freight rates, favorable UGG product mix partially driven by earlier fall demand, favorable UGG full price mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale, and a slight benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $358 million, up 22% versus last year's $294 million, as we continue investing in key areas of the business. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 32.8% versus 33.6% in the prior year, 80 basis points lower than last year. This resulted primarily from the aforementioned timing, considerations regarding earlier consumer demand and timing of certain spend. Our tax rate was 23.8%, which compares to 21.2% for the prior year. These results culminated in diluted earnings per share of $6.82 for the quarter, which is just over $3 above last year's $3.80 diluted earnings per share, representing EPS growth of 79%. This increase in diluted earnings per share was approximately evenly split between gross margin benefits and higher revenue, with a small benefit from a reduced share count resulting from the share repurchases made over the past year. Turning to our balance sheet at September 30, 2023, we ended September with $823 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $726 million, down 21% versus the same point in time last year, and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $185 million worth of shares at an average price of $534.53. As of September 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.1 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now, moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2024, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance to be approximately $4.025 billion from our previous guidance of approximately $3.98 billion. This increase now equates to a full-year growth expectation of approximately 11% versus last year. From a brand perspective, we now expect UGG growth of mid-single digits, up from our prior expectation of low single digits. This upside comes from the continued strength of global brand heat driven by robust early demand. We still expect full-year HOKA revenue growth of above 20%, with third quarter percentage growth anticipated to be slower due to this year's timing of product launches being weighted towards the fourth quarter. And we have reduced our expectation for Teva due to softening macro backdrop. In addition to our fiscal year 2024 updated revenue outlook, gross margin is now expected to be in the range of 52.5% to 53%, reflecting the strength of UGG full-price selling in the second quarter as the brand was able to capture DTC demand early. SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be in the range of 34% to 34.5% as we continue to invest in key areas of the business. Operating margin is now expected to be approximately 18.5%, reflecting the improvement in the gross margin. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation to now be in the range of $22.90 to $23.25. Please note this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include but are not limited to changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, labor shortages, and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. We are proud of the first-half performance by the HOKA and UGG brands, two of the strongest in our industry, which led us to increase revenue guidance heading into the back half of our fiscal year, despite what appears to be a more challenging macroeconomic environment. The HOKA brand's global gains in awareness combined with the early Fall demand we are seeing from UGG give us the confidence to achieve this exceptional outlook. Thanks everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. HOKA and UGG have delivered incredible results for the first-half, and we believe our company is well positioned to deliver on the increased full fiscal year objectives we outlined today. Marketplace Management remains paramount to the ongoing success of Deckers and our continued ability to buck industry trends as we build awareness and drive demand for our brands. Our proficiency in the implementation and delivery of strategic objectives is what truly differentiates Deckers as an organization, allowing our brands to create lasting consumer connections. We are focused on continuing to deliver meaningful consumer experiences with great products and dedicated to doing so with our long-term objectives at the forefront of everything we do. This approach, alongside our flexible operating model, financial discipline, innovation across fashion and performance brands, and our purpose-led culture are what empowers our highly engaged employees to deliver exceptional results and shareholder value. I'd like to thank our entire executive leadership team and all of our employees across the organization for their continued dedication to Deckers values as our company seeks to do good and do great. For more information on these efforts, I'd encourage you to read our forthcoming FY '23 Creating Change report, which launches next week. Thanks everyone for joining us here today and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to continue sharing the exciting future ahead of Deckers. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Congrats on a phenomenal quarter. And I guess wanted to hone in on \u2013 obviously, tremendous momentum as you go into Q3. Q3 is almost 50% of the full-year sometimes in terms of total revenue. So, just curious, given all the momentum you see, particularly in DTC in Q2, how should we think about UGG in the back-half of the year, and particularly Q3?\nDave Powers: Yes, this is Dave. It's a great question. First of all, I want to recognize the momentum that you called out, but the UGG brand experience in Q2, the team did a phenomenal job of recognizing the opportunity earlier in the year, capturing demand that we left on the table last year, cleaning up the marketplace, putting some exciting activations in place with Cardi B and other influential partners for that brand. And the buzz is something that, in my experience at the company, I had never witnessed before, it's palpable. The full-price sell through, the health of the marketplace, the teams just collectively have done an amazing job across the globe to set this brand up for success. And we're really excited that we were able to capture some demand early in the season before holiday shopping and before the potential slowdowns in the marketplace. So, we're set up incredibly well. We're optimistic that this is going to continue for us throughout the year. We're mindful of the fact that this could be a challenging marketplace, so we're not na\u00efve to that fact, but we are prepared for it. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the key styles that we put into the marketplace this year have sold out or sold very well so far. We are in a bit of a chase mode in some of those styles. But I think, across the board, we feel really confident that we have a breadth of product across many silhouettes that are performing well. We have inventory in the right places, a little bit lean in some but we're going to react and chase those. We've eliminated a lot of noise in the assortment in the marketplace. We have incredibly powerful campaigns and activations across the franchises in the brand. We have an exciting new launch of UGGextreme, which is a winter lifestyle collection that we're going to start investing in, in a deeper way. And we have great relationships with our wholesale partners. They need us, especially in this environment. And we want to stay about the promotional marketplace, so we don't want to get caught up in that. We want to maintain a healthy and clean marketplace and continue to drive real strength through our DTC channel. And that's our strategy, and it's working well so far. We're really excited how the fall season has kicked off, and we feel really good about how it's going to continue.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. May be one quick follow-up just on the margin profile in the back-half of the year. It looks like SG&A dollars are planned out on a growth basis pretty significantly. Can you just talk to some of the investments you're making behind UGG and HOKA?\nDave Powers: Yes, I'll let Steve get into the details, but the top four things that we're investing in, which is similar to what we talked about earlier in the year, which is important for us to maintain this level of growth going forward and to be able to continue to grow these brands is really around people, talent, and culture. We're big believers that our culture is one of our secret sauce component, so to speak, and that we have incredibly motivated and collaborative teams that are fired up to win. We're continuing to invest in innovation. We have a powerful innovation pipeline that we want to continue to bolster that supports all of our brands. Systems and data, I don't think there's a company out there right now that feels good about their systems and data, where they're at. We're not alone there. We have some work to do there, but we want to be providing our teams with the right level of visibility so they can run their businesses effectively and leverage AI technologies coming down the pike and then continue to heavily invest in marketing. We feel that, in a constrained environment and a lot of other peers are struggling with inventory and promotions and lower margins, with our profile right now, we have an opportunity to continue to take share in this environment, and we're going to stay aggressive with marketing dollars to do that.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, John, this is Steve. I think just to kind of further on Dave's comment, what we've said now for a number of years is that, I think, one, we're very well financially disciplined as an organization, and we're very careful about where we're placing investments. And I think an indication of that is the increase in the operating margin that we're now guiding to. And so I think we're taking these times of performance and using that to invest in the business. And that's what we've been saying for the past few quarters, is that trust us, we're going to make the investments in the right places. We know that sales have been outpacing what we originally thought. And so, we are making the proper investments, as Dave said, in the business that continue to drive these levels of sales. I think we're demonstrating marketplace management, disciplined investment approach, and that's the way we're operating, and even with that increased investment, leveraging some of the increase in the gross margins to lift our profitability for the year. So, we're doing it in a very strategic, thoughtful, disciplined way.\nDave Powers: Yes. And the last thing I would add on that, as you guys know, we've worked hard to ensure that more of our SG&A is variable versus fixed, and so we maintain a pretty agile, flexible model should we need to cut back on some of those things in the second-half of the year.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask about HOKA just to follow up. Could you maybe share a little more detail on the product shifts you mentioned and how that might impact the growth rates in Q3 and Q4? And then as we think about really the pipeline into next calendar year, just how are you thinking about staying ahead of the competition? Everyone seems to be chasing the maximalist cushioning trend. And any color what you're hearing from your retail partners in terms of some of the order trends?\nDave Powers: Yes, great question. I'm glad you asked that. So, to put a little bit color on how we're thinking about the launches in the second-half in the year, we're strategically pushing launches into the Q4 timeframe. That's when we really get into the beginning of the spring/summer season, when running starts to kick in again. Traditionally, the holiday season is kind of less exciting, so to speak, still a lot of volume to do. But we want to make sure that we come out really powerfully at the beginning of spring, next year in our Q4 timeframe. It also allows us to stay out of the fray of the promotional marketplace in Q3. So, we're anticipating that, particularly in the athletic space where there's a lot of situations where it's over-inventoried with a lot of inventory in the channel and the slowdown of the marketplace, we feel we're better to stay above the fray, so to speak. I don't want to launch two of our major innovation launches coming in Q4 in Q3 when there's a lot of markdowns and promotions going on. So, the teams have strategically decided to push those launches to Q4. I can tell you the innovation that's coming out in two of our launches are incredibly exciting. And then we'll address how the oversized trends are evolving for us. And we're taking that very seriously. We don't want to lose that dominant position in the category that we created. There is a lot of activity, obviously, from competitive brands going in that direction, some good, some bad. But the bottom line is we're not as differentiated as we were three or four years ago with that type of profile. But our technology, our focus on materials and geometry, product testing, new use of plates, different foams, different compounds, et cetera, continues to be at the forefront of everything we do. But we are addressing the fact people may want a little bit of low profile, they want different uses for their product. We think there's a tremendous opportunity in trail and hike, we're going to go heavy after that. We have a dominant position in that already. So, it's top of mind for the teams. I think Stefano, as the interim president of the HOKA brand, with the brand leadership team, has done an exceptional job of fast-tracking our innovation pipeline, and we're excited to unveil some of those new concepts coming up in Q4.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, and I think, Jon, just to add on that, is this aligns with the strategy that we've laid out. So, this is not a change as we've said, the importance of controlling the marketplace, product in the marketplace, maintaining full-price selling, continuing to build brand awareness aligns with our full-year outlook. And so, we're continuing to operate on that with no change on that front. As you can see by Q2 performance, seeing still good growth with the HOKA brand, and really impressed with what we continue to deliver. But we're going to be tight on marketplace management. And that's our strategy, and that's what's paying off.\nDave Powers: Yes. I think the team here is really maintaining a healthy marketplace for the HOKA brand. And listen, HOKA is having an exceptional year. You saw the results in the first-half of the year. On a promotion event or level, we were dominant at the UTMB event this year. In Chamonix, France, our athlete won the race, first American male winner ever in that contest. Two weeks later, our athlete won the Ironman Championship in Nice, France. Actually just today, it was announced by Footwear News that HOKA is the brand of the year. You're seeing the increases in awareness in acquisition from our consumers. Our full-price selling is exceptional. We're still dominant in the run specialty channel. We've got tons of momentum here, and we want to make sure that it doesn't get ahead of us, and that we manage the marketplace effectively to continue to drive strength in DTC. And I think the strategy that the teams have laid out and the cadence of product introductions and innovation is spot on. So, a lot of reasons to be excited, but the same time we're not na\u00efve to the fact that this sector is having some challenges right now. And Q3, as people are talking about the fact that it may be really tough, we haven't quite seen that just yet. But again, it's a sector economic issue that we're going to pay close attention to, but we want to maintain scarcity in the marketplace, full-price sell-through, and keep this brand moving in a healthy pace.\nJonathan Komp: That's very, very helpful, thank you. And Steve, if I could just ask one follow-up on the financial guidance for the year, if I look at the implied second-half performance, it looks like you're implying operating margins down maybe close to a couple hundred basis points year-over-year, and EPS flat to down slightly. Just could you help us make sense of that after the first-half, as obviously such strong year-over-year growth rates, on both of those? Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think it's a good question. And yes, as you're looking to second-half, part of this is recognizing that part of Q2 was benefiting from earlier sales of planned sales that we had in the second-half of the year, right? And so, while we're raising our overall year, it's not the full beat of that what we've experienced in Q2 because some of those sales at this point in time appear to be timing. We'll see how the marketplace plays out kind of in the back half, but combined that with some of the timing of back half sales moving into Q2, passing through what we think is a full-year lift, it is taking some of the sales out of the back half a little bit. But with the overall improvement in the year, and as you know, John, I keep saying, we're focused on the year, not quarters. We are lifting our full-year, we're lifting our full-year gross margins, we're lifting our full-year operating margin. So, like Dave said, we're managing the business for the long run. We're not managing the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at the full-year, that's how we're guiding the full-year. And some of that outperformance in Q2 is allowing us to make these additional investments.\nJonathan Komp: That makes sense. Thanks again.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks, guys. I'm curious to be talking about the HOKA DTC business, how that trended during the quarter, and if there's any comments you can make about quarter-to-date and then also on the UGG side, you had some unmet demand last year. You mentioned you had chased again onto UGG fires. In case of that, you're about to chase. And what are your assumptions for the second-half on being able to fulfill that demand? Thanks.\nSteve Fasching: Okay, Paul. Some of that was a little hard. I'll take my best shot. It's Steve, so on the HOKA DTC business, strong, very strong Q2, up 46%. And we look at that factor as the real true demand signal. We know there are going to be fluctuations with wholesale orders of when they flow. And so we closely watch the DTC performance. And having that up 46% in Q2 is just another strong demonstration of how well HOKA is resonating with consumers, so very encouraged by that. I think as we've said, and as Dave just articulated kind of how we're thinking about Q3 and back half, managing the marketplace, we don't want to get into a promotional environment. We know there's a lot of competition out there that's over inventory. We're seeing a lot of promotion. HOKA's not in that space. We're not having to promote like other brands are. And so how we continue to build this brand forward and then build toward a bigger fourth quarter type increase on percentages terms as we have those new style intros planned for Q4. And then your other second question was chasing, do you want to go Dave?\nDave Powers: Yes, I'll talk about that one. So, I think one thing I think is important to clarify is if you go back three or four years and you look at the UGG brand and what drove the business, it was really one of two styles. It was all basically Classic, Short, Mini. And outside of Classic, we had varying degrees of success with other styles. If you go back seven, eight years, it was the Bailey Bow and Bailey Button. But we were more, quite honestly, of a one trick pony in those days. The way the brand has evolved, the assortment is we have now five to six top-selling franchises. We look at the Tasman, the Taz platform, the Ultra Mini, the Ultra Mini platform, some of the styles like the Classic Dipper. There's a lot more assortment and variation in styles and heights and platforms, et cetera to choose from. And the good news is that they're all resonating very well. And we have a good early reads on things like UGG weather styles, the Neumel Weather and the Classic Weather program. And at the same time, the team has edited the line by about 30% versus prior years. So you have inventory that we can put, traditionally went into lower-selling styles. We put that inventory into the Top 5 to 10 styles this year. With Anne's help on getting the team's focus and putting more emphasis behind these key styles from a marketing perspective, we've also been able to put more depth in those styles and inventory. Now a couple of them, we are selling faster than expected due to the earlier demand but the teams have reacted quickly. We have the ability to chase some inventory, not a ton, but I think you know going into the back end of December will be in good shape on some of these key styles. So we feel like we have the inventory to do what we need to do. It's not a bad thing to leave a little bit of demand on the table if that's the case. And at the same time we have a very exciting launch with UGG Weather Extreme, the UGGextreme collection coming in which is a new category of focus for us going forward. So I think we're in pretty good shape. We have the inventory in the right styles which we didn't last year and I think we've done a great job of adjusting and cleaning up the assortment and putting more power across the five to 10 styles that are really driving the growth.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, and I think Paul just add to that, one of the things with the strength that we've seen in Q2 on some of the styles that have been very popular and we're selling down the inventory. We are looking to expedite some of that back in but there's a limit, right and we won't necessarily be able to chase every sale nor would we want to chase every sale. So we'll see how things play out. But we're set up very well. It is the driver of our full-year increase. So we're very encouraged going into the back half of the year.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nSteve Fasching: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam Poser of Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Thank you for taking my question guys. First of all, Erinn, you've got most of it but Teva, Sanuk and other are my normal question and then I have a whole bunch of questions.\nErinn Kohler: Hi, Sam. Sure. I'll start off with that. So for the second quarter for Global Wholesale Industry as you noted some of this I think you can pull out of what we said but for UGG, $452 million; HOKA, $263 million, Teva, $12 million; Sanuk, $3.3 million and that leaves you with other at just about $30 million.\nSam Poser: Okay. All right, so just skip this out of the way. With Sanuk, are you going to take that as a discontinued operation and going to the balance of the year or how should we think about that in the guidance and so on?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, and so, no, we're not looking to break that to discontinued operations. So we'll continue to report it as we seek to find a buyer. So that's the current plan, yes.\nSam Poser: Okay, and then with the way this is flowing in the back half, was there a lot of pull forward in the UGG Wholesale business? I mean, should we expect UGG Wholesale, especially in the third quarter, to be down given how much came in in Q2?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, so again depending on your model, because we haven't guided the quarter. But yes, what we're basically saying is there is a portion of wholesale orders that occurred in Q2 that you may have planned for in Q3. And that is, what's leading to the increase in the UGG performance. So again, we haven't given quarterly guidance, so I don't know exactly how you had it broken out. But yes, I think safe to say that some of the increase in UGG that we've seen in Q2 is wholesale orders that were moved forward into Q2.\nDave Powers: Yes, and I think what is still to be determined is how much of the upside in we captured in Q2 was just earlier demand or brand heat that will continue through Q3. And so either way, I think we're positioned well, depending on how the market moves. But at this point, the demand seems strong and healthy, and we think it should continue. But as we said, we're heading into an unknown macro environment that's hard to say what it's going to look like. But we're optimistic that some of that demand was brand heat that will continue through Q3.\nSam Poser: So, and then, okay, and then on HOKA, the same kind of question, given that you're moving a big launch, you're moving a big launch away or moving launches out, does that mean that the wholesale business in Q3 would look more like Q2 and then from maybe as a percentage, but then accelerate into Q4. And then, but there's no real reason for DTC. It appears to slow down very much. I mean, that's good momentum on new product. You've launched a lot of new product in the last few weeks, I've noticed.\nDave Powers: Yes, so Sam, it's a good question. And there's kind of different ways to look at it. So, I think, as I said, and Dave has said, we haven't changed the way we're looking at HOKA for the year. So, I think kind of that's most important. Remember, the underlying fundamentals of that is a very controlled wholesale marketplace, right? And so, as we think about Q3, as Dave talked about, we are controlling wholesale in that Q3 period, because we want the market to be seen as we're launching some new product in Q4. So, I think that's an important underlying. The other then is, remember, we had very large DTC comps a year ago. So, when you're looking at some of those -- our DTC comps last year, Q3 was 107. I think Q4 was like 97%. So, we're coming off of very big growth quarters a year ago. So, that's the other thing to consider, right, as we're talking about this. So, there's growth. Then the other thing, I think, to take into account is what we've said about full-year growth. So, as we've said full-year growth, our first-half has exceeded that average full-year growth guide number, which means, by definition, the second-half is going to be a little bit lower, because we're controlling, again, that wholesale component of the marketplace. This is part of our strategy. Now, as we talk and some of our partners have discussed, there will be some wholesale expansion at the end of our Q4, right? So, that won't necessarily get captured in our back half, but it's a setup for next year. So, again, everything is playing out like we've said. The brand continues to perform very well, and I think there are some dynamics that are in there that are important to understand, but most importantly is the brand continues to perform very well.\nDave Powers: Yes, and the last thing I would add to that is last year, we were opening new doors in Q3. So, there was some door expansion, and so the setup quantities led to some of the growth in those doors. This year, we're still maintaining a net neutral through Q3 on door growth. So, comping that door growth last year could have a little bit of an impact on the wholesale performance, too.\nSam Poser: Got you. And then lastly, Dave, you've been now, how long at Decker's?\nDave Powers: A little over 11 years, we've had a long relationship, Sam. What's that?\nSam Poser: Does that make you the elder statesman?\nDave Powers: No.\nSam Poser: So, you weren't in charge of that collaboration?\nDave Powers: No, I was excited to see it, but I want to take credit for that. That was Ann and the team.\nSam Poser: Okay, all right. Thanks very much and have a continued success.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Sam.\nSteve Fasching: All right. Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon, thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on such solid results. I wanted to ask about HOKA. Dave, I think you mentioned that HOKA International grew 44% in the quarter. If that's the case, maybe can you just give a little bit of color, just what you saw by region, what's driving that growth? I think you mentioned a little bit about Europe, but how did you think -- how did you see the growth between wholesale and DTC? Was there a spread between that internationally? And maybe, Steve, I don't know if you can maybe give us some guardrails of how you're thinking about international HOKA growth for the year.\nDave Powers: Yes, so we can validate that number. I don't know that it was exactly 44%, but the bottom line is that we are very excited about the growth that we experienced internationally. That's been a focus of ours for across all of our brands. The international teams are doing a tremendous job by creating brand heat in that marketplace and then also managing the marketplace effectively across DTC and wholesale. The real strength of the growth that we saw in Q2 is really DTC-led, particularly in Europe, exceptional results. Now, smaller percent of our total business, but we think that speaks to the health of the brand and the demand for that consumer as we're investing in more marketing in the region. The events that we mentioned, UTMB and the Ironman, were held in Europe, so there's a lot of buzz around the brand there. And we're just getting better at managing that brand from a DTC perspective, investing in that team and the capabilities over there. So really, the growth is being driven primarily by the DTC channel. Wholesale is still strong, but as we said, in the U.S., we're managing that tightly to create the excitement and the awareness, but still really ultimately drive the business to DTC, and that's a formula we're going to continue to lean on going forward. What was the other question? It was the third question. Over to Steve there.\nSteve Fasching: So, Laurent, I think the number you quoted was total company international DTC growth. So, we didn't provide the HOKA component. So, the total 44%, I think that you quoted, was total company international DTC growth. I think then, just your question on HOKA to me was a little bit about how do we see HOKA internationally expansion -- \nLaurent Vasilescu: For the year.\nSteve Fasching: I think what we see, some of the trends that we're seeing, are similar to what we saw in North America probably a year or 2 ago, right? So, how we're seeing HOKA show up in the run community and then beyond the RUN community is similar, but further behind. And so, this bigger expansion, or faster growth in percentage terms, is another indication that that seems to be the case, that we're seeing the HOKA brand resonate with consumers, kind of starts with runners, RUN community, and begins to build out as awareness grows. Very similar trend to what we've seen in North America. So, in that international arena, we're a little bit behind where we were. Still very early innings for both domestic and international, but a little bit earlier on internationally, and that's why we're seeing those growth percentages high in total company, but you can extrapolate that to the HOKA brand as well.\nDave Powers: Yes, and the new store we opened in Covent Garden in London is off to a great start, and we're seeing that formula play out, which is a mix of performance and everyday runners and lifestyle driving the results there. A lot of tourists experience the brand for the first time, and our stores, our own stores and our partner stores in China continue to perform well also.\nLaurent Vasilescu: That's great to hear. Thank you for that. And then, Dave, I think last quarter during the Q&A, you alluded to the launch of a new brand, that might be small, but maybe just can you give us an update where that stands and with the potential divestiture of Sanuk, does that give you capacity, just bandwidth, time, resources to potentially pursue M&A at the same time of launching a new brand?\nDave Powers: Yes, they're really two separate events. It's not that Sanuk was holding us back from building and launching a new brand, so we look at these separately as just fine tuning our model, just to speak to the Sanuk decision for a second, I'm really proud of how the teams have managed this brand over the last few years from a marketplace management standpoint, and the product right now is very, very strong. But what we've realized is that the journey to scale that brand so that it's meaningful in our portfolio is just too long. There's other things that we think we can invest in, and we think that this is a brand that the consumers love, it deserves a good home, and somebody who can is a priority for them versus a fourth or fifth brand in our portfolio. So it's a tough decision emotionally and financially, but I think it's the best thing for the company and the brand to do this. With regards to the new brand we're working on, I don't want to give away too much to our competition, but we're excited, we're going to be taking the best of HOKA and UGG and all the learnings we have from those two brands and creating what we're calling a super sneaker brand across various categories. We have the distribution channels, we have the DTC network, we have a lot of leverage in the marketplace and some really innovative, exciting products. It'll be a long haul, but we think this is a space that is emerging and that we want to make sure that we have some skin in the sneaker game going forward beyond HOKA. And then as far as M&A goes listen, we have enough organic growth here in our portfolio for the next foreseeable future in years. We're always keeping our eyes on it. We've looked at a lot of opportunities and with regards to what it would do for our company financially and workload and disruption, nothing has come across our desk that we're excited about yet, but it's always top of mind for us and we're continuing to look, but we think listen, we have Teva that has opportunity down the road and we think we can create a new brand and launch that and see if we can make some exciting inroads with both those brands while we focus our real efforts and attention on UGG and HOKA.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Janine Stichter from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, congrats on the great quarter and thanks for fitting me in. Question on HOKA. Wanted to hear more about what you're seeing at some of the more recent doors that you've been in over the last few years, Foot Locker, DICK'S, I think you've recently tested JD. Just curious what the sell-throughs look like there and if you have any thoughts on the type of consumer you're getting, if it's helping you kind of broaden the aperture of the consumer you reach with HOKA. And then on UGG, we'd just love to hear a bit more about international. I think you talked quite a bit about international strength at HOKA, but we'd just love to hear more about what you're seeing there with UGG. And if the momentum is similar versus what you're seeing in the U.S.? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes, good question. So, HOKA Performance, new doors that we have opened up are performing very, very well. I was talking to Stefano, who's overseeing that brand, right now the new doors that we've opened over the last year, new accounts, all performing very well. High level of full-price sales, strong turns, scaling market share, run specialty stores where we have a number one position there that we're fighting every day to maintain and we want to build out in that position. But new doors and Foot Locker and DICK's and JD, et cetera. They want more. So that's a good sign. And the way that we're performing those doors is right in line with what we would have hoped would happen. But we're managing it tightly as we have been doing so that we maintain full-price selling at healthy turns and gross margins for our partners. It's a good question on the type of consumer, Foot Locker, as an example was a strategic play, not just from a volume play, but also strategic to reach a younger lifestyle consumer, both male and female. And we're seeing that happen. I think some of the success in Q2 was probably back-to-school business that we hadn't really realized before. And with our focus on 18 to 34-year old consumers and college athletes, we're seeing that pay off. And so it's exciting to see high school athletes and college athletes and beyond gravitating to our brand, going to those doors, looking for the brand, making the choice of HOKA over a traditional Nike Dunk or Air Force 1. That's super exciting. We're going to keep a close eye on that because we don't want that to be a big spike and then go away. So we need to manage that tightly and the lifestyle teams are all over that and working with our accounts to make sure that it's a healthy business for the long-term. And then on UGG International, similar to what Steve was saying in HOKA, UGG is an international, particularly in Europe, is at the point where UGG was a couple of years ago, really healthy, strong growth. They've been working hard on local marketing activations and leveraging PR in the region. And the new product is resonating extremely well across the board, but particularly with younger consumers there. And it's really exciting to see. And we haven't been in this position in Europe quite some time, but the momentum is real. The brand heat is improving. The level of acquisition and consideration for our consumers are all heading in the right direction. So we think this is an opportunity to build on this, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, our two biggest markets and we're going to continue to play this playbook out and get more aggressive with marketing activations in the region.\nJanine Stichter: Great, thanks so much and best of luck.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. It's great to be here with you today to discuss our exceptional second quarter, where our two marquee brands experienced high levels of full-price consumer demand, leading to revenue increasing 25% versus last year, eclipsing $1 billion for the first time in our September-ending quarter, gross margin improving 520 basis points versus last year and diluted earnings per share increasing nearly 80% versus last year to $6.82. Our direct-to-consumer business was the fastest-growing component of revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing nearly 40% versus last year, with HOKA growing 46% and UGG increasing 38% as both brands experienced a greater than 30% global increase in consumer acquisition. Our global wholesale business also put up strong revenue growth in the second quarter, increasing 19% versus last year, again driven by our two largest brands, UGG and HOKA. Our wholesale accounts also continue to see incredible heat and momentum for our key styles across both brands. With this strong consumer demand, selling for wholesale in the quarter included some accelerated fall seasonal shipments, benefiting our first-half results, and increasing our confidence to achieve our outlook for the fiscal year. As we continue to focus on our strategic marketplace management, we are pleased to have captured this strong momentum of demand early in the year, particularly with these products capturing high levels of full-price selling across all channels. As we focus on delivering the full-year, I think it's important to reflect on our year-to-date performance. We closed out a record first-half for Deckers, with total portfolio revenue across all channels growing 19% versus last year, driven by HOKA revenue increasing 27% from global strength across its ecosystem of access points, UGG revenue increasing 18% primarily from gains across international regions and global DTC, total portfolio global DTC acquisition and retention increasing 29% and 27% respectively, and international revenue across all brands increasing 23% versus last year. While Steve will provide further details on our financial performance and related increased outlook later in the call, I'd like to emphasis how proud we are of the continued alignment of our strong near-term performance with Deckers' long-term objectives to build HOKA into a multibillion dollar performance brand, grow UGG through direct-to-consumer connections with elevated products and experiences, expand DTC through consumer acquisition and retention gains, and drive international growth through targeted investments. With that, let's get into the highlights of our successful first-half, starting with HOKA. Global revenue in the first-half increased 27% versus last year. This impressive result reflects the HOKA brand's successful marketplace management execution, which is driving more business to DTC in conjunction with market share gains from high full-price sale through at our existing points of wholesale distribution. HOKA revenue growth in the first-half was led by direct-to-consumer, which increased 54% versus last year, and represented 38% of revenue, up from 31% in the prior year. This was aided by global increases in brand awareness according to Deckers proprietary brand tracker study, consumer acquisition, which is up 47% versus last year; and consumer retention, which is up 52% versus the prior year, HOKA experienced significant growth in awareness across all major markets, with the U.S. growing to approximately 30%, and international regions, on average, rising to mid teens with much more room to grow. Specific to our gains in DTC in the first-half, consumer acquisition in EMEA DTC nearly doubled to help achieve a 75% year-over-year increase in channel revenue for the region. This represents great progress for our EMEA region. And though DTC remains a relatively small percentage of its total revenue, we see this expansion as a positive indictor that HOKA is increasingly resonating with the European consumer. As we have demonstrated in the U.S., thoughtfully building brand awareness through marketing activations and strategic marketplace presence served as a catalyst to DTC acceleration as the brand begins to take hold with the local consumer. To that end, HOKA recently opened its first European flagship store in Covent Garden in London, giving the brand a powerful presence in one of the most influential footwear markets around the world. In the U.S., HOKA continues to deliver exceptional growth. DTC revenue increased nearly 50% versus last year for the first-half, with strong growth among 18- to 34-year-old retained consumers, which increased 70%. We believe some of this demand was fueled by HOKA having increased resonance in the back-to-school timeframe with college-age students. Brand loyalty among this group is especially exciting given the increased potential lifetime value of repeat purchases. The HOKA marketing teams have done an exceptional job building global brand awareness through compelling Fly Human Fly campaign content, connecting with consumers at HOKA-sponsored events, and highlighting the incredible performances of HOKA athletes. We continue to sponsor key running events around the globe as part of our commitment to support the sport and provide a platform to showcase our innovative performance products. This includes events from 5ks to elite ultramarathons for all types of athletes around the world, allowing us to elevate the brand with pinnacle performance-minded consumers and also to broaden worldwide awareness of the achievements capable in HOKA products. This year's HOKA-sponsored UTMB or Ultra-Trail Mont-Blanc World Series Finals, held in Chamonix, France, is the perfect example of our team's 360-degree collaborative approach to building HOKA brand awareness and performance credibility. This trail running event allows us to celebrate the roots of HOKA, which was born in the French Alps, further connecting the brand with European consumers. At the UTMB World Series Finals, the HOKA team set up a base camp that offered consumers the opportunity to engage with the brand in a unique way through athlete meet-and-greets, 24-hour product testing, and shoe personalization. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the experience, and are already looking forward to leveraging these learnings at future events. HOKA made its mark on the event, both from a product and athlete performance standpoint, with several impressive achievements, including HOKA athlete Jim Walmsley making history becoming the first American man to win the Dacia UTMB, a 106-mile race that included more than six miles of elevation gain, completing the course in a record time of less than 20 hours. HOKA raking top among all brands with the most top-five finishes across the series of three races, and HOKA remaining the number one brand worn by UTMB participants. From a product standpoint, first-half HOKA growth was driven by a variety of categories and styles, which includes, among others; the Clifton franchise which benefited from the ninth addition launch as well as new successful lifestyle versions with suede uppers, stability staples like the Arahi and Gaviota franchises, the latter of which launched its fifth edition during the second quarter as we are seeing increased adoption of this category from consumers; trail and hike favorites, the Challenger and Anacapa franchises benefiting from new innovations incorporated in recent updates; speed shoes highlighted by the Rocket X Refresh and the all-new Mach X; and new lifestyle options including the popular Solimar and Transport styles. We remain encouraged by the breadth of category adoption across the innovative HOKA product assortment, which continues to evolve and attract new consumers to the brand. We are implementing greater segmentation across the ecosystem of HOKA Access Points to ensure our accounts are best positioned to serve their respective consumers and emphasize DTC as the pinnacle destination to experience the full depth of the brand's product offering. For the balance of the year, the HOKA team remains focused on executing its Marketplace Management Strategy which includes a focus on building global brand awareness and heat to increase demand which is helping to drive high full price sell-through at DTC and across wholesale allowing the brand to deliver healthy growth with best-in-class margins and inventory turns. Complemented by several new innovative product launches coming up in our fourth quarter, we expect HOKA to continue delivering strong results for the remainder of this fiscal year and well beyond. Now shifting to UGG, global revenue in the first-half increased 18% versus last year. The brand's strong first-half performance was driven primarily by high levels of brand heat, disciplined Marketplace Management leading to product scarcity on key styles exiting last Fall, and intentional pull forward of the brand's Fall marketing campaign relative to past years. We currently have the most cohesive globally aligned product, marketing, and consumer targeting strategy I've ever seen for UGG. Marketplace Management has been a core strength of the UGG brand for some time now. The allocation and segmentation of core and popular new styles continues to serve the brand well helping drive high levels of full price sell-through. Last year we shared that we did not fully capture demand on several key styles. As we began this fiscal year, we strategically developed targeted inventory that caters to the brand's most popular products and seeded the Fall marketing campaign, field Like UGG, in July as opposed to the typical September timeframe. From July 15th to August 15th, we saw a groundswell of influencer public service announcements reminding consumers to buy UGG now. Videos using hashtag UGG's received over 25 million views during that timeframe, and UGG saw twice the level of engagement on Instagram as compared to last year. We believe the UGG Team's strategic marketing shift served as a catalyst for earlier Fall consumer demand globally. In the U.S. specifically, this shift helped fuel greater back-to-school demand, with search interest increasing 46% versus last year, according to Google Trends. To keep this momentum going, at the tail end of September, UGG celebrated the official kickoff of hashtag UG season. with music superstar Cardi B, whose video announcement featuring the new classic dipper had nearly 20 million views. This resulted in significant press and media coverage of our launch, with influential publications such as Billboard and Vogue featuring UGG. Brand Heat, created by the UGG team, directly translated to incredible first-half results, particularly from the global DTC business and international regions, which both experienced a revenue increase of above 25% versus last year. Furthermore, UGG gross margins benefited from transitional and Fall products selling at full price during the second quarter. This dynamic is in contrast with prior years, with the brand's DTC business has historically been more weighted towards end of Spring and summer products that generally carry a lower average selling price. The Tasman franchise, including the Taz platform as well as the classic mini and ultra mini franchises have been the focal products of UGG's search interest and revenue growth in the first-half as expected. We are also excited that some of the new Fall franchises are beginning to resonate with consumers as well, including the aforementioned Classic Dipper, a key globally marketed style, the all gender hybrid weather collection, which includes modernized weather ready versions of the Tasman and Neumel, and the Lowmel, a sneaker hybrid take on the original Neumel. UGG is well positioned to capture consumer demand during the holiday season with great products like these. Considering the demand we've seen thus far, we are already in chase mode for a select group of popular items and colors, for which we are expediting production to ensure greater DTC inventory through the season. The UGG brand's first-half growth sets us up well, especially when factoring the signals of a weakening global economy and lower consumer confidence. Given this dynamic, we are glad to have captured some demand earlier to help reduce the pressure of competing with more promotional brands during this upcoming holiday season, as we see to continue selling premium UGG products at full price. Moving on to our discussion of consolidated channel performance, global growth was across both direct-to-consumer and wholesale, with DTC being the primary driver of revenue gains in the first-half, increasing 37% versus last year. Our portfolio experienced DTC strength relative to last year across consumers with acquired and retained increasing 29% and 27% respectively, brands with HOKA and UGG revenue increasing 54% and 26% respectively, regions with international and domestic revenue increasing 48% and 34% respectively, and channels as consumer demand was robust in stores and online. Additionally, we saw a double-digit increase in average selling price as a result of a greater mix of HOKA, higher full-price selling for UGG combined with a focus on fewer proven SKUs and more favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Regarding global wholesale, revenue in the first-half increased 11% versus last year, growth was driven by strength in UGG and HOKA as well as across both our domestic and international regions. Market share gains continue to be the primary avenue of wholesale growth for HOKA, which is now the top-selling brand in U.S.-run specialty stores in aggregate, according to third-party market sources. HOKA has also quickly become the top-running brand with key strategic partners in applicable doors. Our teams are extremely proud of the HOKA brand's top market share achievement, which further validates the brand's performance-rooted credibility. UGG wholesale performance in the first-half is right in line with our strategy this year, with international regions fueling the majority of growth, while the brand maintains its strong business in the U.S. With these first-half results, it is clear that our marketplace management strategies are working well, positioning our brands to excel during the holiday quarter and capture increased consumer demand across their respective ecosystems of access points. Before I hand it off to Steve to discuss our results in more detail, I'll note that we also announced our plan to divest Sanuk. At Deckers, we're focused on the most effective allocation of our resources that are in alignment with long-term objectives. Consumers have long valued Sanuk for its fun, innovative, and comfort-first products. Over the coming months, we will work to find the right owner to support the brand's next chapter while we continue to execute our growth priorities. Thanks, everyone. And now I'll hand it over to Steve. Thanks, Steve. HOKA and UGG have delivered incredible results for the first-half, and we believe our company is well positioned to deliver on the increased full fiscal year objectives we outlined today. Marketplace Management remains paramount to the ongoing success of Deckers and our continued ability to buck industry trends as we build awareness and drive demand for our brands.

I'd like to thank our entire executive leadership team and all of our employees across the organization for their continued dedication to Deckers values as our company seeks to do good and do great. For more information on these efforts, I'd encourage you to read our forthcoming FY '23 Creating Change report, which launches next week. Thanks everyone for joining us here today and thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support. We look forward to continue sharing the exciting future ahead of Deckers. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes, this is Dave. It's a great question. First of all, I want to recognize the momentum that you called out, but the UGG brand experience in Q2, the team did a phenomenal job of recognizing the opportunity earlier in the year, capturing demand that we left on the table last year, cleaning up the marketplace, putting some exciting activations in place with Cardi B and other influential partners for that brand. And the buzz is something that, in my experience at the company, I had never witnessed before, it's palpable. The full-price sell through, the health of the marketplace, the teams just collectively have done an amazing job across the globe to set this brand up for success. And we're really excited that we were able to capture some demand early in the season before holiday shopping and before the potential slowdowns in the marketplace. So, we're set up incredibly well. We're optimistic that this is going to continue for us throughout the year. We're mindful of the fact that this could be a challenging marketplace, so we're not nai\u0308ve to that fact, but we are prepared for it. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the key styles that we put into the marketplace this year have sold out or sold very well so far. We are in a bit of a chase mode in some of those styles. But I think, across the board, we feel really confident that we have a breadth of product across many silhouettes that are performing well. We have inventory in the right places, a little bit lean in some but we're going to react and chase those. We've eliminated a lot of noise in the assortment in the marketplace. We have incredibly powerful campaigns and activations across the franchises in the brand. We have an exciting new launch of UGGextreme, which is a winter lifestyle collection that we're going to start investing in, in a deeper way. And we have great relationships with our wholesale partners. They need us, especially in this environment. And we want to stay about the promotional marketplace, so we don't want to get caught up in that. We want to maintain a healthy and clean marketplace and continue to drive real strength through our DTC channel. And that's our strategy, and it's working well so far. We're really excited how the fall season has kicked off, and we feel really good about how it's going to continue. Yes, I'll let Steve get into the details, but the top four things that we're investing in, which is similar to what we talked about earlier in the year, which is important for us to maintain this level of growth going forward and to be able to continue to grow these brands is really around people, talent, and culture. We're big believers that our culture is one of our secret sauce component, so to speak, and that we have incredibly motivated and collaborative teams that are fired up to win. We're continuing to invest in innovation. We have a powerful innovation pipeline that we want to continue to bolster that supports all of our brands. Systems and data, I don't think there's a company out there right now that feels good about their systems and data, where they're at. We're not alone there. We have some work to do there, but we want to be providing our teams with the right level of visibility so they can run their businesses effectively and leverage AI technologies coming down the pike and then continue to heavily invest in marketing. We feel that, in a constrained environment and a lot of other peers are struggling with inventory and promotions and lower margins, with our profile right now, we have an opportunity to continue to take share in this environment, and we're going to stay aggressive with marketing dollars to do that. Yes. And the last thing I would add on that, as you guys know, we've worked hard to ensure that more of our SG&A is variable versus fixed, and so we maintain a pretty agile, flexible model should we need to cut back on some of those things in the second-half of the year. Thanks, John. Yes, great question. I'm glad you asked that. So, to put a little bit color on how we're thinking about the launches in the second-half in the year, we're strategically pushing launches into the Q4 timeframe. That's when we really get into the beginning of the spring/summer season, when running starts to kick in again. Traditionally, the holiday season is kind of less exciting, so to speak, still a lot of volume to do. But we want to make sure that we come out really powerfully at the beginning of spring, next year in our Q4 timeframe. It also allows us to stay out of the fray of the promotional marketplace in Q3. So, we're anticipating that, particularly in the athletic space where there's a lot of situations where it's over-inventoried with a lot of inventory in the channel and the slowdown of the marketplace, we feel we're better to stay above the fray, so to speak. I don't want to launch two of our major innovation launches coming in Q4 in Q3 when there's a lot of markdowns and promotions going on. So, the teams have strategically decided to push those launches to Q4. I can tell you the innovation that's coming out in two of our launches are incredibly exciting. And then we'll address how the oversized trends are evolving for us. And we're taking that very seriously. We don't want to lose that dominant position in the category that we created. There is a lot of activity, obviously, from competitive brands going in that direction, some good, some bad. But the bottom line is we're not as differentiated as we were three or four years ago with that type of profile. But our technology, our focus on materials and geometry, product testing, new use of plates, different foams, different compounds, et cetera, continues to be at the forefront of everything we do. But we are addressing the fact people may want a little bit of low profile, they want different uses for their product. We think there's a tremendous opportunity in trail and hike, we're going to go heavy after that. We have a dominant position in that already. So, it's top of mind for the teams. I think Stefano, as the interim president of the HOKA brand, with the brand leadership team, has done an exceptional job of fast-tracking our innovation pipeline, and we're excited to unveil some of those new concepts coming up in Q4. Yes. I think the team here is really maintaining a healthy marketplace for the HOKA brand. And listen, HOKA is having an exceptional year. You saw the results in the first-half of the year. On a promotion event or level, we were dominant at the UTMB event this year. In Chamonix, France, our athlete won the race, first American male winner ever in that contest. Two weeks later, our athlete won the Ironman Championship in Nice, France. Actually just today, it was announced by Footwear News that HOKA is the brand of the year. You're seeing the increases in awareness in acquisition from our consumers. Our full-price selling is exceptional. We're still dominant in the run specialty channel. We've got tons of momentum here, and we want to make sure that it doesn't get ahead of us, and that we manage the marketplace effectively to continue to drive strength in DTC. And I think the strategy that the teams have laid out and the cadence of product introductions and innovation is spot on. So, a lot of reasons to be excited, but the same time we're not nai\u0308ve to the fact that this sector is having some challenges right now. And Q3, as people are talking about the fact that it may be really tough, we haven't quite seen that just yet. But again, it's a sector economic issue that we're going to pay close attention to, but we want to maintain scarcity in the marketplace, full-price sell-through, and keep this brand moving in a healthy pace. Yes, I'll talk about that one. So, I think one thing I think is important to clarify is if you go back three or four years and you look at the UGG brand and what drove the business, it was really one of two styles. It was all basically Classic, Short, Mini. And outside of Classic, we had varying degrees of success with other styles. If you go back seven, eight years, it was the Bailey Bow and Bailey Button. But we were more, quite honestly, of a one trick pony in those days. The way the brand has evolved, the assortment is we have now five to six top-selling franchises. We look at the Tasman, the Taz platform, the Ultra Mini, the Ultra Mini platform, some of the styles like the Classic Dipper. There's a lot more assortment and variation in styles and heights and platforms, et cetera to choose from. And the good news is that they're all resonating very well. And we have a good early reads on things like UGG weather styles, the Neumel Weather and the Classic Weather program. And at the same time, the team has edited the line by about 30% versus prior years. So you have inventory that we can put, traditionally went into lower-selling styles. We put that inventory into the Top 5 to 10 styles this year. With Anne's help on getting the team's focus and putting more emphasis behind these key styles from a marketing perspective, we've also been able to put more depth in those styles and inventory. Now a couple of them, we are selling faster than expected due to the earlier demand but the teams have reacted quickly. We have the ability to chase some inventory, not a ton, but I think you know going into the back end of December will be in good shape on some of these key styles. So we feel like we have the inventory to do what we need to do. It's not a bad thing to leave a little bit of demand on the table if that's the case. And at the same time we have a very exciting launch with UGG Weather Extreme, the UGGextreme collection coming in which is a new category of focus for us going forward. So I think we're in pretty good shape. We have the inventory in the right styles which we didn't last year and I think we've done a great job of adjusting and cleaning up the assortment and putting more power across the five to 10 styles that are really driving the growth. Yes, and I think what is still to be determined is how much of the upside in we captured in Q2 was just earlier demand or brand heat that will continue through Q3. And so either way, I think we're positioned well, depending on how the market moves. But at this point, the demand seems strong and healthy, and we think it should continue. But as we said, we're heading into an unknown macro environment that's hard to say what it's going to look like. But we're optimistic that some of that demand was brand heat that will continue through Q3. Yes, so Sam, it's a good question. And there's kind of different ways to look at it. So, I think, as I said, and Dave has said, we haven't changed the way we're looking at HOKA for the year. So, I think kind of that's most important. Remember, the underlying fundamentals of that is a very controlled wholesale marketplace, right? And so, as we think about Q3, as Dave talked about, we are controlling wholesale in that Q3 period, because we want the market to be seen as we're launching some new product in Q4. So, I think that's an important underlying. The other then is, remember, we had very large DTC comps a year ago. So, when you're looking at some of those -- our DTC comps last year, Q3 was 107. I think Q4 was like 97%. So, we're coming off of very big growth quarters a year ago. So, that's the other thing to consider, right, as we're talking about this. So, there's growth. Then the other thing, I think, to take into account is what we've said about full-year growth. So, as we've said full-year growth, our first-half has exceeded that average full-year growth guide number, which means, by definition, the second-half is going to be a little bit lower, because we're controlling, again, that wholesale component of the marketplace. This is part of our strategy. Now, as we talk and some of our partners have discussed, there will be some wholesale expansion at the end of our Q4, right? So, that won't necessarily get captured in our back half, but it's a setup for next year. So, again, everything is playing out like we've said. The brand continues to perform very well, and I think there are some dynamics that are in there that are important to understand, but most importantly is the brand continues to perform very well. Yes, and the last thing I would add to that is last year, we were opening new doors in Q3. So, there was some door expansion, and so the setup quantities led to some of the growth in those doors. This year, we're still maintaining a net neutral through Q3 on door growth. So, comping that door growth last year could have a little bit of an impact on the wholesale performance, too. A little over 11 years, we've had a long relationship, Sam. What's that? No. No, I was excited to see it, but I want to take credit for that. That was Ann and the team. Thanks, Sam. Yes, so we can validate that number. I don't know that it was exactly 44%, but the bottom line is that we are very excited about the growth that we experienced internationally. That's been a focus of ours for across all of our brands. The international teams are doing a tremendous job by creating brand heat in that marketplace and then also managing the marketplace effectively across DTC and wholesale. The real strength of the growth that we saw in Q2 is really DTC-led, particularly in Europe, exceptional results. Now, smaller percent of our total business, but we think that speaks to the health of the brand and the demand for that consumer as we're investing in more marketing in the region. The events that we mentioned, UTMB and the Ironman, were held in Europe, so there's a lot of buzz around the brand there. And we're just getting better at managing that brand from a DTC perspective, investing in that team and the capabilities over there. So really, the growth is being driven primarily by the DTC channel. Wholesale is still strong, but as we said, in the U.S., we're managing that tightly to create the excitement and the awareness, but still really ultimately drive the business to DTC, and that's a formula we're going to continue to lean on going forward. What was the other question? It was the third question. Over to Steve there. Yes, and the new store we opened in Covent Garden in London is off to a great start, and we're seeing that formula play out, which is a mix of performance and everyday runners and lifestyle driving the results there. A lot of tourists experience the brand for the first time, and our stores, our own stores and our partner stores in China continue to perform well also. Yes, they're really two separate events. It's not that Sanuk was holding us back from building and launching a new brand, so we look at these separately as just fine tuning our model, just to speak to the Sanuk decision for a second, I'm really proud of how the teams have managed this brand over the last few years from a marketplace management standpoint, and the product right now is very, very strong. But what we've realized is that the journey to scale that brand so that it's meaningful in our portfolio is just too long. There's other things that we think we can invest in, and we think that this is a brand that the consumers love, it deserves a good home, and somebody who can is a priority for them versus a fourth or fifth brand in our portfolio. So it's a tough decision emotionally and financially, but I think it's the best thing for the company and the brand to do this. With regards to the new brand we're working on, I don't want to give away too much to our competition, but we're excited, we're going to be taking the best of HOKA and UGG and all the learnings we have from those two brands and creating what we're calling a super sneaker brand across various categories. We have the distribution channels, we have the DTC network, we have a lot of leverage in the marketplace and some really innovative, exciting products. It'll be a long haul, but we think this is a space that is emerging and that we want to make sure that we have some skin in the sneaker game going forward beyond HOKA. And then as far as M&A goes listen, we have enough organic growth here in our portfolio for the next foreseeable future in years. We're always keeping our eyes on it. We've looked at a lot of opportunities and with regards to what it would do for our company financially and workload and disruption, nothing has come across our desk that we're excited about yet, but it's always top of mind for us and we're continuing to look, but we think listen, we have Teva that has opportunity down the road and we think we can create a new brand and launch that and see if we can make some exciting inroads with both those brands while we focus our real efforts and attention on UGG and HOKA. Thank you. Yes, good question. So, HOKA Performance, new doors that we have opened up are performing very, very well. I was talking to Stefano, who's overseeing that brand, right now the new doors that we've opened over the last year, new accounts, all performing very well. High level of full-price sales, strong turns, scaling market share, run specialty stores where we have a number one position there that we're fighting every day to maintain and we want to build out in that position. But new doors and Foot Locker and DICK's and JD, et cetera. They want more. So that's a good sign. And the way that we're performing those doors is right in line with what we would have hoped would happen. But we're managing it tightly as we have been doing so that we maintain full-price selling at healthy turns and gross margins for our partners. It's a good question on the type of consumer, Foot Locker, as an example was a strategic play, not just from a volume play, but also strategic to reach a younger lifestyle consumer, both male and female. And we're seeing that happen. I think some of the success in Q2 was probably back-to-school business that we hadn't really realized before. And with our focus on 18 to 34-year old consumers and college athletes, we're seeing that pay off. And so it's exciting to see high school athletes and college athletes and beyond gravitating to our brand, going to those doors, looking for the brand, making the choice of HOKA over a traditional Nike Dunk or Air Force 1. That's super exciting. We're going to keep a close eye on that because we don't want that to be a big spike and then go away. So we need to manage that tightly and the lifestyle teams are all over that and working with our accounts to make sure that it's a healthy business for the long-term. And then on UGG International, similar to what Steve was saying in HOKA, UGG is an international, particularly in Europe, is at the point where UGG was a couple of years ago, really healthy, strong growth. They've been working hard on local marketing activations and leveraging PR in the region. And the new product is resonating extremely well across the board, but particularly with younger consumers there. And it's really exciting to see. And we haven't been in this position in Europe quite some time, but the momentum is real. The brand heat is improving. The level of acquisition and consideration for our consumers are all heading in the right direction. So we think this is an opportunity to build on this, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, our two biggest markets and we're going to continue to play this playbook out and get more aggressive with marketing activations in the region. Thank you."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We are excited by the strong performance HOKA and UGG continued to exhibit through the first-half of fiscal year 2024, stemming from our strategic marketplace management execution that continues to benefit our brands. As Dave covered, HOKA drove another quarter of strong growth led by DTC, while UGG demonstrated broad-based growth across regions and channels by continuing to captivate consumers and elevate its presence around the world. Our record second quarter revenue exemplifies the exceptional demand for our brands, and we look forward to continuing this momentum as we enter our largest and most complex fiscal quarter. While ongoing macroeconomic challenges persist, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate this dynamic marketplace. With a strong financial framework and in-demand brands, we remain committed to building the foundation for success that drives long-term sustainable growth. Now, let's get into the details of second quarter results. Second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1.092 billion, representing an increase of 25% versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 24% versus last year. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong demand experienced across the HOKA DTC channel, which increased 46% versus last year, and contributed to delivering total brand revenue of $424 million for the quarter and broad-based UGG growth across regions and channels, delivering $610 million of revenue, with global DTC increasing 38% and wholesale increasing 25%. With the HOKA brand's performance consistent with our expectation, the outsized UGG growth in the second quarter benefited from, first, a higher level of wholesale shipments in Q2 this year than in the past couple of years were captured in the first quarter, as transit times have reduced, supply chain logistics have improved, and availability of inventory is more consistent relative to during the pandemic. Second, seeding the fall global UGG campaign earlier in the quarter, reminding consumers of the scarcity that took place in the prior year, which created brand heat and demand for those same popular styles that sold out quickly last year, driving earlier consumer purchasing this year. And third, an increased level of demand for the brand during the back-to-school period, which signaled some wholesalers to desire shipments on an accelerated timeframe relative to our original plan. Gross margin for the second quarter was 53.4%, up 520 basis points from last year's 48.2%. Second quarter gross margin benefited from lower ocean freight rates, favorable UGG product mix partially driven by earlier fall demand, favorable UGG full price mix, favorable channel mix with DTC continuing to grow faster than wholesale, and a slight benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A dollar spend in the second quarter was $358 million, up 22% versus last year's $294 million, as we continue investing in key areas of the business. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 32.8% versus 33.6% in the prior year, 80 basis points lower than last year. This resulted primarily from the aforementioned timing, considerations regarding earlier consumer demand and timing of certain spend. Our tax rate was 23.8%, which compares to 21.2% for the prior year. These results culminated in diluted earnings per share of $6.82 for the quarter, which is just over $3 above last year's $3.80 diluted earnings per share, representing EPS growth of 79%. This increase in diluted earnings per share was approximately evenly split between gross margin benefits and higher revenue, with a small benefit from a reduced share count resulting from the share repurchases made over the past year. Turning to our balance sheet at September 30, 2023, we ended September with $823 million of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $726 million, down 21% versus the same point in time last year, and during the period we had no outstanding borrowings. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $185 million worth of shares at an average price of $534.53. As of September 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.1 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases. Now, moving into our updated guidance for fiscal year 2024, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance to be approximately $4.025 billion from our previous guidance of approximately $3.98 billion. This increase now equates to a full-year growth expectation of approximately 11% versus last year. From a brand perspective, we now expect UGG growth of mid-single digits, up from our prior expectation of low single digits. This upside comes from the continued strength of global brand heat driven by robust early demand. We still expect full-year HOKA revenue growth of above 20%, with third quarter percentage growth anticipated to be slower due to this year's timing of product launches being weighted towards the fourth quarter. And we have reduced our expectation for Teva due to softening macro backdrop. In addition to our fiscal year 2024 updated revenue outlook, gross margin is now expected to be in the range of 52.5% to 53%, reflecting the strength of UGG full-price selling in the second quarter as the brand was able to capture DTC demand early. SG&A as a percentage of sales is now expected to be in the range of 34% to 34.5% as we continue to invest in key areas of the business. Operating margin is now expected to be approximately 18.5%, reflecting the improvement in the gross margin. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be in the range of 22% to 23%, and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation to now be in the range of $22.90 to $23.25. Please note this guidance excludes any charges that may be considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from additional share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which include but are not limited to changes in consumer confidence and recessionary pressures, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, labor shortages, and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. We are proud of the first-half performance by the HOKA and UGG brands, two of the strongest in our industry, which led us to increase revenue guidance heading into the back half of our fiscal year, despite what appears to be a more challenging macroeconomic environment. The HOKA brand's global gains in awareness combined with the early Fall demand we are seeing from UGG give us the confidence to achieve this exceptional outlook. Thanks everyone. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Yes, John, this is Steve. I think just to kind of further on Dave's comment, what we've said now for a number of years is that, I think, one, we're very well financially disciplined as an organization, and we're very careful about where we're placing investments. And I think an indication of that is the increase in the operating margin that we're now guiding to. And so I think we're taking these times of performance and using that to invest in the business. And that's what we've been saying for the past few quarters, is that trust us, we're going to make the investments in the right places. We know that sales have been outpacing what we originally thought. And so, we are making the proper investments, as Dave said, in the business that continue to drive these levels of sales. I think we're demonstrating marketplace management, disciplined investment approach, and that's the way we're operating, and even with that increased investment, leveraging some of the increase in the gross margins to lift our profitability for the year. So, we're doing it in a very strategic, thoughtful, disciplined way. Yes, and I think, Jon, just to add on that, is this aligns with the strategy that we've laid out. So, this is not a change as we've said, the importance of controlling the marketplace, product in the marketplace, maintaining full-price selling, continuing to build brand awareness aligns with our full-year outlook. And so, we're continuing to operate on that with no change on that front. As you can see by Q2 performance, seeing still good growth with the HOKA brand, and really impressed with what we continue to deliver. But we're going to be tight on marketplace management. And that's our strategy, and that's what's paying off. Yes, I think it's a good question. And yes, as you're looking to second-half, part of this is recognizing that part of Q2 was benefiting from earlier sales of planned sales that we had in the second-half of the year, right? And so, while we're raising our overall year, it's not the full beat of that what we've experienced in Q2 because some of those sales at this point in time appear to be timing. We'll see how the marketplace plays out kind of in the back half, but combined that with some of the timing of back half sales moving into Q2, passing through what we think is a full-year lift, it is taking some of the sales out of the back half a little bit. But with the overall improvement in the year, and as you know, John, I keep saying, we're focused on the year, not quarters. We are lifting our full-year, we're lifting our full-year gross margins, we're lifting our full-year operating margin. So, like Dave said, we're managing the business for the long run. We're not managing the business on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at the full-year, that's how we're guiding the full-year. And some of that outperformance in Q2 is allowing us to make these additional investments. Okay, Paul. Some of that was a little hard. I'll take my best shot. It's Steve, so on the HOKA DTC business, strong, very strong Q2, up 46%. And we look at that factor as the real true demand signal. We know there are going to be fluctuations with wholesale orders of when they flow. And so we closely watch the DTC performance. And having that up 46% in Q2 is just another strong demonstration of how well HOKA is resonating with consumers, so very encouraged by that. I think as we've said, and as Dave just articulated kind of how we're thinking about Q3 and back half, managing the marketplace, we don't want to get into a promotional environment. We know there's a lot of competition out there that's over inventory. We're seeing a lot of promotion. HOKA's not in that space. We're not having to promote like other brands are. And so how we continue to build this brand forward and then build toward a bigger fourth quarter type increase on percentages terms as we have those new style intros planned for Q4. And then your other second question was chasing, do you want to go Dave? Yes, and I think Paul just add to that, one of the things with the strength that we've seen in Q2 on some of the styles that have been very popular and we're selling down the inventory. We are looking to expedite some of that back in but there's a limit, right and we won't necessarily be able to chase every sale nor would we want to chase every sale. So we'll see how things play out. But we're set up very well. It is the driver of our full-year increase. So we're very encouraged going into the back half of the year. Thank you. Yes, and so, no, we're not looking to break that to discontinued operations. So we'll continue to report it as we seek to find a buyer. So that's the current plan, yes. Yes, so again depending on your model, because we haven't guided the quarter. But yes, what we're basically saying is there is a portion of wholesale orders that occurred in Q2 that you may have planned for in Q3. And that is, what's leading to the increase in the UGG performance. So again, we haven't given quarterly guidance, so I don't know exactly how you had it broken out. But yes, I think safe to say that some of the increase in UGG that we've seen in Q2 is wholesale orders that were moved forward into Q2. All right. Thanks, Sam. So, Laurent, I think the number you quoted was total company international DTC growth. So, we didn't provide the HOKA component. So, the total 44%, I think that you quoted, was total company international DTC growth. I think then, just your question on HOKA to me was a little bit about how do we see HOKA internationally expansion -- I think what we see, some of the trends that we're seeing, are similar to what we saw in North America probably a year or 2 ago, right? So, how we're seeing HOKA show up in the run community and then beyond the RUN community is similar, but further behind. And so, this bigger expansion, or faster growth in percentage terms, is another indication that that seems to be the case, that we're seeing the HOKA brand resonate with consumers, kind of starts with runners, RUN community, and begins to build out as awareness grows. Very similar trend to what we've seen in North America. So, in that international arena, we're a little bit behind where we were. Still very early innings for both domestic and international, but a little bit earlier on internationally, and that's why we're seeing those growth percentages high in total company, but you can extrapolate that to the HOKA brand as well."

I'm pleased to be here today to discuss another strong quarter for Deckers, starting off fiscal 2024 on the right path as we build towards delivering another year of great results. Our results give us increased confidence to achieve our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2024, which includes a raise to our prior expectations. For the first quarter, our performance slightly outpaced our expectations, with revenue increasing 10% versus last year, to $676 million, gross margin improving more than 300 basis points including beneficial brand and channel mix dynamics, and diluted earnings per share growing 45% to $2.41. Revenue growth versus last year was driven by our key areas of focus, with global HOKA expanding 27% to deliver $420 million, global DTC increasing 35% to represent 37% of portfolio revenue, up from 30% last year, and international UGG delivering strong growth. As anticipated, we had some offsets to the growth in the quarter due to timing dynamics in UGG U.S. wholesale, with accounts choosing to receive products for it later into the year as opposed to a frontloaded preference we saw in the last couple of years. As we look to best manage our wholesale account product flow, we also continue to monitor marketplace inventory levels to maintain a healthy omnichannel presence that services our end consumer in the best way possible, and preserves the premium nature of our brands. Our ability to propel the targeted opportunities of global HOKA, global DTC, and international UGG further demonstrates the success of our omnichannel marketplace management and strategic investments. We will continue to remain nimble in execution, as we always have, to deliver strong results on both the top and bottom line. With the continued execution of our long-term vision, we believe Deckers is emerging as a leading creator of compelling consumer connections through highly desirable products that infuse disruptive innovation across both fashion and performance. As a reminder, our long-term strategic vision remains focused on building HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, growing the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expanding our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention, and driving international growth through strategic investments. Steve will provide further details around our increased forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let's dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, starting with the brand highlights. As mentioned, global HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year, to $420 million, a quarterly record, and the first time the brand eclipsed $400 million in a single quarter. The HOKA brand's well-managed ecosystem of access points continues to flourish. DTC was the primary growth driver in the quarter, increasing 63% versus last year, and accounting for approximately two-thirds of total brand growth. DTC growth was broad-based as each region grew the business more than 50% versus the prior year, global consumer acquisition increased 58%, global consumer retention increased 57%, and 18 to 34-year-old consumers in the U.S. increased 68%. This exceptional DTC demand resulted in an improvement in gross margin as HOKA maintained high levels of full-price selling, and continues to benefit from shifting a greater proportion of revenue mix to DTC. While the HOKA brand's DTC business is still predominantly ecommerce, our select retail stores are augmenting the brand's presence by increasing awareness and brand engagement with a physical presence in key strategic markets, creating personal consumer connections through community-oriented experiences, and broadening category adoption by showcasing the depth of the HOKA product offering. For these reasons, we expect to continue testing potential permanent locations through pop-up stores. We are excited about a couple of new doors that are in the pipeline, and look forward to sharing more soon. From a wholesale perspective, HOKA continues to drive growth and manage the marketplace to build market share in existing points of distribution, maintain high levels of full-price sell-through, increase category shelf space through differentiated products, and expand brand awareness with a broader consumer demographic. HOKA has preserved high levels of full-price sell-through, and remains one of the fastest turning brands within the majority of its wholesale accounts. We continue to tightly manage the marketplace inventory and closely monitor HOKA key performance indicators in the channel to ensure the brand maintains its premium positioning across its ecosystem of access points. As excess consumer demand materializes, we prefer that HOKA satisfies upside through the brand's DTC business, which is what we saw happen this quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum that HOKA has sustained across its distribution landscape, and continue to make investments to build awareness and affinity for the brand across key markets. In June, HOKA launched the second edition of its Fly Human Fly global marketing campaign, and is already seeing the benefits of this upgraded rollout. This edition of the campaign was designed to reinforce that HOKA stands for joyful and inclusive performance at its highest level. As campaign content and activations continue to roll out across the globe, HOKA has seen a powerful response from consumers in the first few weeks, including robust growth in online engagement across social channels and digital platforms, especially with the release of the campaign's focal film, titled, Murmuration, which embodies the brand ethos of moving together. Heightened attention brought directly to HOKA.com with the vast majority of digital campaign asset clicks yielding first-time visitors to our brand's ecommerce platform globally, more than doubling the conversion rate of HOKA.com landing page visitors, and significant impressions from out-of-home activations. We are optimistic about the reach and broad appeal of this campaign as HOKA continues to introduce itself to new consumers around the world. And the brand is as visible as it has ever been, with connected TV advertising, billboards, special running events, and several compelling activations in the pipeline. On the heels of the Fly Human Fly campaign rollout, HOKA launched the all-new Mach X, which was designed for propulsive everyday running, and features high-rebound cushioning and a Pebax plate. Mach X media content was seamlessly weaved into the Fly Human Fly launch. And HOKA further celebrated this innovative product creation with several regional activations to aid Mach X awareness, including a demo run, in Germany, where participants were challenged to run as far as they could for 30 minutes, a sprint relay in France across a two-kilometer loop, in [Les Deux, Chamonix] (ph), a college event in Eugene, Oregon, hosting demo community runs to celebrate the U.S. Track and Field Championships, and a two-day HOKA experience clinic at our retail store in Japan, and at a popup location in Thailand. These global events, combined with the connected TV, social media, and digital out-of-home content have created significant energy behind the HOKA brand's latest shoe innovation. The Mach X was treated as an exclusive launch in our own DTC channel, and with our run specialty partners as we continue to work towards greater segmentation of the HOKA brand's compelling product line. Just a few weeks into the second quarter, the Mach X is close to cracking the top 10 sales globally on HOKA.com, and we are getting great feedback so far from our run specialty partners. HOKA continues to build a bigger business through the expansion and increased adoption of its lineup of innovative products. We see the Mach X as an incremental addition to the already stellar portfolio of our footwear, led by the brand's most popular styles, Clifton and Bondi. The Mach is a great example of franchise development where the team has innovated upon the original Mach which continues to perform exceptionally well, by introducing the snappier and more competitive version, the Mach X. It is with this approach to product line management that HOKA is able to broaden the aperture of HOKA consumers, while maintaining pinnacle positioning in the performance athletic space. HOKA has an amazing roster of athletes around the world who are competing at the highest level, and achieving incredible results wearing commercially available versions of our shoes. During this past quarter, HOKA athlete, Cole Watson finished first in the Canyons Endurance 100K wearing the HOKA Tecton X carbon-plated trail running shoe. Congratulations to Cole who, with this victory, punched his ticket to the UTMB Mont-Blanc, a HOKA-sponsored event to be held in Chamonix, France, at the end of August. Moving to UGG, global revenue in the first quarter decreased 6% versus last year, to $196 million. As expected, this decline resulted from lapping earlier wholesale shipping patterns over the last couple of years in the U.S. UGG was able to offset this challenging compare in the U.S. with the strength of the brand's international regions. International strength was broad-based across multiple regions, and in both wholesale and DTC channels. In particular, our EMEA region, as well as China, which benefited from lapping lower demand from lockdowns in the prior year, drove above average growth. These regions found success attracting consumers with more transitional styles, like the Ultra Mini, Tasman, and Classic Mini, as well as seasonal franchises, like the Goldenstar and LA Cloud. We are encouraged by the continued progress of international regions to increase the adoption of key global franchises year-round. Part of the excitement behind these franchises is being driven by the brand's more focused approach to product marketing, creating greater global alignment of key stories. With this more focused approach; UGG is maintaining high levels of brand heat with more consumers actively searching for the brand. During the first quarter, online search interest across Europe increased 60% versus last year, with outsized strength in the U.K. and France. The same is true in the U.S., where search interest increased 21% versus last year according to Google Trends. UGG brand momentum also benefited from this spring's Feel House activation at Coachella. The Feel House, first launched in the fall of 2022, is a multisensory community experience dedicated to making self-expression comfortable for all. UGG invited individuals from around the world to experience this latest iteration of the Feel House, which was designed as an oasis for creatives, in Palm Springs, California. The Feel House was decorated with signature artwork from New York City-based artist, KidSuper, who partnered with UGG to design a quick-strike collaboration of the Tasman X, whose global activation drove significant press coverage with the likes of influential publications, such as Esquire, Teen Vogue, Daily Mail, and Hypebeast. As a result of the UGG team's continued brand activations and compelling products, UGG global DTC increased 6% versus last year. UGG experienced consumer demand both in stores and online. We have been particularly excited by the interest of consumers who are shopping in person, especially during the spring and summer seasons. We believe this dynamic is partly attributable to the development and greater adoption of transitional franchises that embrace the brand's heritage DNA and have greater year-round wearing occasions. By maintaining this momentum, the entire UGG product portfolio benefits, especially in our stores, where consumers can feel and directly engage with the broader product offering. For this reason, and in line with our focus on elevate the UGG brand in an influential international market, subsequent to quarter-end, we opened our newest flagship store in the high tourist traffic Harajuku shopping district of Tokyo. With the first quarter behind us, we remain confident in executing the UGG plan we outlined for fiscal year 2024, evidenced by the continued momentum of global markets as consumers actively search for UGG, growth of global direct-to-consumer with improved margins from full-price business, and strength of iconic silhouettes like the Ultra Mini and Tasman driving year-round excitement. Entering the second quarter, the UGG team is working hard to state its global omnichannel marketplace to connect with consumers through engaging experiences in the autumn/winter season. To execute this vision, UGG will be expanding on and embracing the celebration of culture and community by creating meaningful experiences, such as the Feel House, that serve as an invitation to develop and emotional connection with the brand. This fall, UGG will celebrate its brand heritage through consumer-centric moments around the world, with new winter lifestyle-themed Feel House executions, an exciting new winter product aimed at capturing more of the winter fashion and resort-focused consumer. Shifting to our discussion of consolidated channel performance, global direct-to-consumer drove first quarter revenue growth, increasing 35% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and 33% on a comparable basis. Strength in the channel was driven by continued increases in HOKA consumer acquisition and retention globally. HOKA consumer growth was robust across regions and various age demographics, with outsized growth among international markets and the 18-34 year-old cohort, which remain key targets for us. The UGG DTC business also experienced growth, driven by more than 20% increase internationally, that benefited from China catching up from lockdowns in the prior year. The strength in China resulted from increased adoption of both sneaker and sandal styles. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue was down 1%, as gains in HOKA were offset by UGG U.S. shipment timing realignment to pre-pandemic cadence, as well as a continued focus to manage the marketplace inventory of our brands to maintain high levels of full price selling in this more promotional consumer landscape. Overall, we are pleased with the China results, which reflect the power of our marketplace management strategies that continue to benefit our wholesale partners, DTC business, and ultimately Deckers bottom line. With that, I will hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our increased outlook for fiscal year 2024. Steve?\nSteve Fasching: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the first quarter and demonstrated great progress toward our full fiscal year and raised outlook. HOKA was the driver of growth in the quarter, lead by strong performance in the DTC channel, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally, as represented by international growth. As anticipated, UGG's global revenue was lower than last year, primarily due to lapping earlier selling during the prior year. But the brand maintains high levels of consumer interest, capturing increased demand through our DTC in the quarter. As we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment, we remain committed to executing against our strategic priorities, and maintaining our disciplined approach to managing our business. We are encouraged by the demand signals we are seeing, and believe our portfolio of leading brands continues to resonate with consumers globally. With that, let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results. Revenue was $676 million, up 10% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year, due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brand's DTC channel and global ecosystem of access points. Gross margins for the quarter were 51.3%, which is up 330 basis points from last year's 48%. First quarter gross margin benefited from lower freight costs, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue, and an increased mix of DTC business with slight offsets from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the same period last year, and select closeouts of seasonal inventory. SG&A dollar spent in the first quarter was $276 million, which is up 16% from last year's $238 million. SG&A growth was driven by reinvestment in key areas of the business in support of our growth targets, which includes strategic marketing, including the spend intended to amplify HOKA awareness in leading international markets, supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, enhanced e-commerce capabilities, and talent across the organization, including areas we've delayed in the enterprise support functions. Our tax rate was 21.9%, which compares to 21.3% in the prior year. These results coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchases program drove diluted earnings per share of $2.41 for the quarter, which was $0.75 above last year's $1.66 per share, representing growth of 45%. Turning to our balance sheet, at June 30, 2023, we ended June with $1.05 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $741 million, down 12% versus the same point in time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $25 million worth of shares at an average price of $485.95. As of June 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.3 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now, moving on to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2024, with the HOKA brand's DTC business exceeding our expectation in the first quarter, we are increasing our full-year top line revenue guidance to be approximately $3.98 billion from our previous range of approximately $3.95 billion. This increase represents full-year growth expectations of approximately 10% versus the prior year. As a result of this update, we now expect HOKA growth to exceed 20% for the fiscal year 2024, compared to fiscal year 2023, with the majority of growth anticipated to come from the brand's direct-to-consumer business. UGG revenue is still expected to increase low single-digits, driven by international expansion and a focus on driving more business to DTC. Beyond our updated revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2024, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 52%, representing a more than 150 basis point improvement relative to last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue, as we re-invest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business. Operating margin is still expected to be approximately 18%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be 22% to 23%, and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation now to be in the range of $21.75 to $22.25. The $0.65 increase is related to the increased expectation for HOKA DTC and an increased expectation for interest income as we benefit from working capital improvements, including inventory management, driving higher cash balances that are earning at a higher interest rate. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that maybe considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from future share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which includes but not limited to supply chain disruptions, constraints, and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence, and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in our disciplined operating model, well-positioned brands, robust financial profile, and ability to remain nimble as we adapt to evolving marketplace dynamics. Thanks, everyone, And I will now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2024 is off to a nice start, with HOKA continuing its strong momentum, and the balance of our brand portfolio on track to our full-year expectations. While keeping our long-term strategies top of mind, we are operating fiscal year 2024 with a sharp focus to prioritize DTC growth across all of our brands, while managing wholesale marketplace inventory to drive online acquisition in a high level of full price selling, expand HOKA brand awareness globally, lead with UGG products that are proven to resonate with global consumers, thoughtfully manage inventory to align with consumer demand, and invest in enterprise infrastructure in key strategic growth areas. We believe Deckers' unique ability to introduce exciting innovation into both fashion and performance products, is why our differentiated brands are able to create lasting consumer connections. This along with our financial discipline, agile operating platform, exceptional marketplace management and purpose-led culture allow us to continue to deliver best-in-class results, and exceptional shareholder value. On behalf of our management team, I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to delivering results and making Deckers a great place to work. And I would also like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole: Great, thank you so much. My question is on HOKA. You talked about, obviously, really strong DTC performance for HOKA in the quarter. Can you just talk about a little bit what you say at wholesale, and then talk about what you're seeing for the rest of the year? And really just going back to the quarter for a second, just talk about some of the drivers of the HOKA growth just across channel in terms of product that would be great? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes, thanks, Jay. So, yes, obviously we are super excited about the continued momentum of HOKA, broad-based, it's just continuing to meet or exceed expectations for us, and we're really optimistic about the rest of the year. DTC growth, as you saw from both brands, was exceptional. Wholesale for HOKA is about where we expected it to be for this quarter; couple puts and takes here and there by channel and region. But generally speaking, right in line with our marketplace management expectations. We love how this flywheel is working for us. We're creating awareness out in the marketplace at a top level of the funnel. The awareness is increasing dramatically for the brand, up 20% over last year. And that's driving all channels, but particularly, as designed, into DTC. So, there's some noise out in the wholesale channel with markdowns and promotions from other brands, a lot of inventory in the channel, so we're managing that tightly by purpose. But again, as I say, raising awareness at a high level and seeing the brand interest coming directly to our DTC business is super exciting for us. Obviously it's our most profitable sale. We gain all the data from that and it creates even a stronger flywheel going forward in the marketplace as we expand globally. Some of the things that are driving HOKA for the quarter, this was a HOKA-driven quarter, as expected, right? So, this isn't a big quarter for UGG. A lot of the top-selling styles for the company overall for the quarter were driven by HOKA. Again, the Clifton and the Bondi continue to be the frontrunners here. The Clifton 9 has been received extremely well globally, and we're looking to get more inventory into that franchise and continuing the upside of that franchise going forward. And then also in the hike side of things, that business is still very strong. In places like REI, we're the number one running brand, and also in hike. And then in the international regions, particularly in China, we have a very strong hike business. So, we're going to continue to go after that. We've got some new innovations launching. We just launched the Mach X, which has been received very well with the PEBA plate, and there's a little more attainable price point, and then continuing to update franchises throughout the year with some very, very exciting launches of existing upgrades, but also some new product coming into Q4.\nJay Sole: Got it. Okay, thank you so much.\nDave Powers: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Congrats on such good results. Hey, Steve, I'd love to ask about your HOKA DTC strategy. I think in the 10-K it's noted that you have 18 HOKA stores. I believe those are permanent stores; predominantly located in Asia, correct me if I'm wrong. But can you provide a little bit of color on how these stores are performing and what lessons are you learning from the store opened up in -- permanent store you opened up in New York? And how many stores do you envision for the brand over the next couple of years?\nDave Powers: I can speak to that, and then, Steve, you want to get into specifics.\nSteve Fasching: Sure.\nDave Powers: Yes, this is -- like we're doing with everything else in our marketplace, we like to test and learn. And when we see positive signs we like to go fast and capture opportunities, and so far, very good on retail. Fortunately for us, we know how to run retail stores based on our legacy of UGG retail stores over the last 20 years, we have the operations globally to do it, and we're leveraging that platform exceptionally well. The stores that we have opened, both pop-ups and permanent, are exceeding or on plan, no concerns as of this point. But we do want to take it slow. We want to make sure we're not overextending ourselves; we're going into markets that are accretive to the overall marketplace strategy, but are also creating awareness to important consumers in key locations around the globe. We need retail to work in China. We can't have a distributor business with partners if we don't know how to do retail very well, so we're fine-tuning that. But, so far, the partners are pleased. We're very positive and optimistic about our own retail stores there as well. Excited to open our first permanent store in New York City, feedback from that has been exceptional. And I think for us, now, it's really about fine-tuning the experience for the consumer in the stores. So, the operations and the behind the scenes, we have dialed, but we want to make sure this is an exceptional experience for the consumer beyond just the product. We're looking at holding events and run clubs, and making sure that there is engagement with the community in these stores as well to drive renewed interest or renewed -- sorry, I should say repeat visits from existing customers, but also creating awareness and showing the full breadth of the line for new customers to the brand. So, off to a good start. Small in the scheme of things at this point, but we see upside here. And as far as size of stores and how many, we don't have a number put on that yet. It all depends on how the marketplace evolves. But DTC is our primary objective here. And using our stores to grow online, and vice versa. But you'll see a handful of key stores being opened in key cities and locations as we go, and continuing to leverage our popup and test model before we make long-term commitments.\nSteve Fasching: Yes, Laurent, this is Steve. Just on the number, you're right, 16 are the company-owned stores, so that does not include retail partners that we have in Asia or with some of our distributors. So, those are not included in the store count. So, the 16 -- sorry, 18 are included are company-owned, not inclusive of some of our retail partners as well. And then just as Dave said, I think the performance of those has exceeded our expectations, both from a revenue and a profit standpoint. And we use the pop-ups to inform us on locations. So, as we see pop-ups perform very well, it gives us a good indication of store location and opportunity for a permanent location. And we'll continue to operate in that manner. And we continue to look at area where we can continue to expand the HOKA retail store presence.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful, thank you for all that color. And then just as a follow-up, I think Stefano was elevated to Chief Commercial Officer, in April.\nDave Powers: Yes.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Just curious to know if you have any update with regarding a permanent find for the brand president for HOKA. And then just another -- sneaking in one more question. You've got $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Can you just remind us your capital allocation [technical difficulty] audience?\nDave Powers: Yes, so just on -- with Stefano, super excited to elevate him to that role, well-deserved. And we spoke on the last call, I believe, the HOKA business is in excellent shape under Stefano's leadership. He knows this space incredibly well, and we're excited about the fast-tracking of innovation and marketplace management that's happening there. No news to report yet on the HOKA full-time president replacement. But I would say, trust that we're confident in the business until we do, and we'll be excited to announce that when the time comes.\nSteve Fasching: And then just on the capital allocation question, no change in terms of how we're thinking about it. Clearly, like to operate from a position of strength, so have an incredibly strong balance sheet, especially in current times, I think that serves us well, constant conversation with our Board in terms of how we're looking at capital allocation. But as we've indicated over prior quarters, we have been and look at share repurchase as a great way to return value to our shareholder base. So, we'll continue to look at that and evaluate that. But yes, in terms of how we're thinking about it, no change. And we'll continue to have conversations with our Board.\nLaurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much, and best of luck.\nSteve Fasching: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next today comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Erinn, I think two of the five have been answered. So, can you give me -- well, can you give me wholesale for every brand, please?\nErinn Kohler: Sure. So, wholesale for each of the brands, including distributor at a global scale, so for UGG, that's $121.5 million; for HOKA, $260.8 million; Teva, $35.1 million; Sanuk, $6.5 million. And then you have some other.\nSam Poser: Okay, thank you. So, either Dave or Steve, on HOKA DTC, can you give us some idea of what you're looking at for the full-year there, given that's going to be the big driver of this? Are we going to have -- I mean, is there going to a 4 handle on it, a 5 handle on it, the growth?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think -- that's a good question. Right, clearly we've seen DTC perform slightly above our expectation in Q1. We've reflected that in the raised guidance for the year. And we're continuing to watch that. As part of -- and Dave articulated this a little bit, part of our strategy is to manage the wholesale marketplace tightly. And we'll let some of that excess demand come over into our DTC channel, and we'll fulfill there. But a little bit harder to gauge how that consumer shows up, but we're confident in our ability to grow DTC, and with HOKA specifically. And we'll see how the year plays out. But what we're encouraged by is a strong start to the year, continue to see growth in our DTC business, and growth with our HOKA DTC business. And then we'll see how the year continues to play out.\nSam Poser: [Multiple speakers]\nDave Powers: Yes, I think one thing to note is we -- sorry, Sam. We do have hard comps coming forward in the next three quarters, just something to be aware of. But I think we're learning what's possible with our DTC engine here. And so, this is very encouraging signs for us. The thing to keep in mind also is wholesale is a bit of a uncertain entity right now with inventory in the channel, there's a lot of estimates it's going to be a promotional back-half for the year. So, the way we're looking at this is we're trying to focus on the total consumer opportunity regardless of channel, and have the inventory available for our DTC business if whole continues to be a little bit more challenging or promotional, we're confident that they'll come to us, and with our marketing campaigns at the top of the funnel we can drive more direct -- target traffic directly to our channels and DTC channels. But this is certainly very encouraging, it's right in line with our strategy to get the whole company at 50% DTC down the road. And we're going to continue the hammer away at it.\nSam Poser: Thanks. And then lastly, you're investing a lot in the SG&A, but you tend to roll it forward. Is this going to be another year like normal, where you don't really see that leverage on all that SG&A until we come out of the -- you can't really roll it out of the fourth quarter again? Are we looking at it the same way?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think the way we're looking at it, Sam, is we're coming out of a year, last year, our FY '23, where we held back on some of those SG&A investments, and that was to offset some of the headwinds that we were experiencing on the gross margin. So, that was an intentional holdback to really deliver on our commitment to get to 18% operating margin. So, this year, as we're seeing some of that gross margin expansion, it is affording us that opportunity to invest. So, we are looking at it, that's embedded in our guidance for the year, of the approximate 18% operating margin, so again, with that gross margin expansion, taking that opportunity to invest in some of those things that we held back on last year. And we'll see how we're doing. I think Q1 is a demonstration where we have invested a little bit more, so you're seeing a little bit of an increase on that SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the quarter. So, we'll continue to see. But I think it's important that we continue to invest in these brands, part of that, as I mentioned, strategic investment in HOKA marketing. We know that there is an incredible opportunity out there, and this is an opportunity for us to continue to build international brand awareness. And then just on kind of the infrastructure in town, we're in the competitive space. And with how well we're doing, it's important for us to remain competitive in that space as well. So, those are all things that we're considering. But again, we're delivering, in my mind, exceptional operating profit levels, and so it affords us the opportunity with this gross margin expansion to make those investments.\nDave Powers: Yes, and I think, this is from my perspective, I want to make sure that we have the operations at Deckers to take this business to $5 billion, $6 billion over the coming years. And so, we want to make sure, and I've said to my leadership team that we need to focus on infrastructure investment, innovation, the systems, data accessibility, global supply chain investments, DCs, that so we are ready for the growth when it continues to come. And in the past, some quarters we've pushed out marketing spend because we didn't need it to hit our numbers, but we're rethinking this. We're much more strategic now. We want to make sure we're doing more activity at the top of the funnel, connected TV, et cetera. And we have some great created from both HOKA and UGG that you'll on connected TV this coming season, in fall. And the ELT is completely aligned on where additional SG&A opportunities are going to go and how we prioritize them. So, if we see signs that there is opportunity to free up some more spend for some of these strategic initiatives, Steve and I are looking at it quick, we're allocating the money fast so that teams can get on with it and create more upside. But I am excited about the opportunities of marketing for HOKA specifically, but also UGG, and UGG men's, and some new exciting product launches coming this fall for both of them, and on the marketing side too.\nSam Poser: Thank you. Continued success.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Sam.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Janine Stichter with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nJanine Stichter: Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on the great quarter, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the wholesale environment in the U.S. really for the UGG brand. Understanding the tough multiyear comparisons you have there, I'm just wondering what you're hearing from your wholesale partners, both on their broader ordering patterns, and then specifically on sell-through for UGG? Certainly hearing it's tough out there. And then also wanted to hear more about the UGG transitional franchises, sounds like they're working really well on DTC, but wondering what the appetite is for that product at wholesale? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes, good questions. This is a -- it's always a funny quarter for UGG because we're dealing with deliveries into wholesale, getting ready for fall, we have some leftover from spring, and we're comping -- particularly this quarter, for UGG, we're coming a lot of fluff business from last year. So, it is a little bit noisy. But the good news that we're seeing in here is how the consumers are reacting. Brand interest is up dramatically, especially in 18 to 34-year-olds. The styles that we have invested in with heavy inventory, this coming fall, the Tasman and the Ultra Mini and platform styles. We sold out of those styles last year. We're getting back in inventory now. They're already selling through very well despite the heat waves that are going around across the country. So, the indicators that we are seeing for the UGG brand, consumer interest, consumer buzz, excitement around these franchise styles, and even a couple of new styles that we just launched early, a sneaker and then a -- it's more -- I forget the name of it, but it's an UGG style that has a knit upper on it. Those are in the top 10 of UGG.com, so, a lot of reasons to be excited. Wholesale partners, they know they need UGG to be successful this season. They know that there is opportunity in these key styles that we're getting after, and those are the things that we have focused our buys on for them. The other key thing to keep in mind is we have reduced our SKU count dramatically in UGG. So, last year at this time, we were over 600 SKUs heading into fall. This year, we're just over 400. And so, we've cleaned up the assortment. We've funneled our inventory into these key styles that we know there is high demand for. And we're getting the marketing behind those styles to really drive high level of interest and sell-through. On the traditional styles, one of the top selling styles globally is the Scuffette. And so, we're still seeing a lot of interest and renewed interest with younger consumers in some of our core classics. But what's really encouraging is the iterations with the platform style really leveraging the Tasman, the Neumel, these Ultra Mini styles, and then new iterations that we're going to be launching in the fall and holiday. We've just been through a great deal of work under Anne and the marketing team's leadership on resetting our brand positioning and defining our brand codes and design, and applying those to our core classics, and iterating off of those with new materials, and new outsoles, and different shapes is bringing some really exciting product to market. And I think you're going to see some of that start to happen this fall, and continue through spring, and next fall as well.\nJanine Stichter: Great. And on the SKU count reductions, are there any potential gross margin savings that might go along with that?\nDave Powers: Yes, short and long-term, right? And so, I just reviewed with the leadership team yesterday, the fall '24 line. And the teams all said to us, \"Listen, this is -- we're doing less work, and the styles that we're spending more time on are getting better and better, and more exciting.\" And so, I think you're going to see both in focused, you're going to see it in quality in aesthetic and design, and you're ultimately going to see a margin opportunity a little bit as well. We haven't flushed that out yet, and we don't have it in any of the guidance or anything, but certainly when brands go through this work there is certainly opportunity for margin savings.\nJanine Stichter: Great, thanks so much.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.\nKelly Crago: Hi, guys. This is Kelly on for Paul. Got a couple questions for you, first on the gross margin in the first quarter, looks like it came in a little bit light of expectations, and that's despite HOKA DTC driving upbeat. So, just curious what the driver of that was? I think you've mentioned some select closeouts of seasonal inventory. Curious if that was not planned going into the quarter. Any color there would be great. Thanks.\nSteve Fasching: Kelly, this is Steve. I think on the quarter, we pretty much delivered kind of to our expectation. I know some of the models may have been a little bit higher than we were. My guess is where you may have been a little bit higher was around a promotion assumption and potentially a foreign currency assumption. When we look at the 330 beat, that's a pretty substantial beat, in line with what were thinking. Just to give you some sense of how that broke down, the freight channel mix in brand was around 450 basis points of it, and that was offset by about 100 basis points which was a mix of promo and foreign currency. So, just depending on how you factored that into your model, but generally speaking, in line, but yes, as we mentioned we did do some closed out to seasonal items in Q1, which is impacting that gross margin.\nKelly Crago: Was that across both UGG and HOKA?\nDave Powers: Yes, it was sum of both in the quarter.\nKelly Crago: Got it. And then, on the -- so, HOKA wholesale grew in low-double in the first quarter, I think the distributor transition was impacting that. Is there any way to quantify, so we could kind of understand that underlying wholesale growth and how that should trend for the rest of the year? Is the accounting distributor transition 1Q-specific, or does it carry forward? Any color domestically versus international on the wholesale growth side in HOKA? And then, lastly on that determined door perspective, your sort of gross door, new door opening for HOKA, and then, sort of on that basis as well? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Sure, Kelly. There is a lot in there. Let me try to thrive some of that. So, you are right, we did do, and Italian distributor conversion, so that is impacting. A year ago Q1 would have picked up the distributor order, which would have covered multiple quarters in the wholesale model. So, you are seeing some kind of delay of those sales in the Italy market. We have not talked about how much that is, but not a huge number and a Q1 impact, but safe to say, within millions of dollars in terms of what the impact was. But you will see pick up in the wholesale business later. So, that was impacting some of the wholesale distributor growth in Q1. Then the other parts of your question were\u2026\nSteve Fasching: HOKA wholesale in general and door account.\nKelly Crago: Yes\u2026\nDave Powers: Yes. So, what we are looking at just in terms of with specific to HOKA door account, wholesale, is what your question was?\nKelly Crago: Yes, pretty much.\nDave Powers: Yes, I think the way we are looking at it is, on our prior call we talked about kind of no global net new doors. We are going to continue to evaluate and see what that looks like. We are probably seeing some growth in North America, and some declines on the international business as we are cleaning up some of that distribution. And then we will continue to monitor. So, that was kind of point in time as we see demand and performance with these doors within accounts will continue to evaluate that.\nSteve Fasching: But no real change in strategy.\nDave Powers: But no change in strategy. Yes.\nKelly Crago: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp: Yes, thank you. Dave, I want to follow-up on a comment you made, I think you said you are building the infrastructure to be $5 billion to $6 billion consolidated revenue company, would that be on sort of three to five-year horizon, I don't know any thoughts on that. And I guess thinking about the next couple of billion of revenue, how would you see that split across the brands? I'm just curious if you had any more color on those comments.\nDave Powers: Yes, let me grab my LRP necessarily. That's just generally speaking, like, my job as CEO I need to be looking three to five years out, you know, and based off where we are today and on the cash flow hitting $4 billion mark, my head is like, \"Okay, so do we get to $5 billion and $6 billion, what it's going to take from the team perspective and infrastructure perspective, category expansion, all those things.\" So, when I put out, say, $5 billion or $6 billion, that's just generally thinking, \"Hey, down the road, we are going to get to these numbers. I don't have anything to share with how that is.\" But certainly if you put the pieces together you could see it happening as well, with the current growth we are seeing. In HOKA, I think you're going to see a resurgence of UGG over the coming years in Anne's leadership, and hopefully we get Teva to be a meaningful number in the coming years as well. So, it's within line of sight for sure, but I don't want to put a timeline or brand mix or any of that yet, it's early days, but the opportunity we see is this company to be a $5 billion-$6 billion business over time for sure.\nJonathan Komp: Got it, I appreciate that color. Thank you. And maybe related, a bigger picture question on HOKA and category expansion, how are you thinking about lifestyle, fitness, other categories, especially it looks like there are some very favorable reviews of -- the transport access in new category, it looks like a hard shoot to get a hold of, so just curious how you're thinking about a broader category expansion potential for HOKA?\nDave Powers: Yes, we are in the transform; myself right now have trouble finding it honestly. So, that one surprised us. I was actually little bit skeptical about how that was going to received in the marketplace. It's not necessarily positioned as a performance shoe, although I do running it and work out in it, and so, it's very versatile. But I think it's showing us that there is more aperture and appetite for HOKA to being meaningful in the lifestyle space, whether that is color ups or fabric changes or design details and some of our franchise styles. We pull things out of the vault. I mean we're 10-year-old now, we have things actually in the vault that customers ask for. But there is opportunity for new styles like the Transport and the TransportX that we tested this year. And we think that there is emerging opportunity in lifestyle, it's not just people wearing a running shoe anymore, they want shoes made for all day wear, that feel like running shoes, but have a little bit of a different aesthetic, and we see a massive opportunity there not only within the HOKA brand, but we are working on launching a new brand actually in Spring's timeframe, to go after some of that opportunity as well. So, as far as category growth, right now if you ask Stefano and the team, we are focused on being to maintaining our dominant position in run, we want to be number one in hike and trail over the coming years. We think that's a tremendous opportunity, and that's an important category that's growing within the category, but also has lifestyle implications as well, and then really cultivating the lifestyle, distribution and consumer with performance product that has a little bit of a different aesthetic. If you think about down the road, different categories, we are exploring other categories as well, and those things take time to develop. So, we are having the teams on the sidelines looking at different opportunities, like different categories, whether it's court shoes or whatever that maybe. But we are thinking that way for the long-term, but right now we are really focused on run, hike and the lifestyle opportunity.\nJonathan Komp: That makes sense. Just last one, Steve, if I could, your gross margin this year you're still guiding in a couple of hundred basis points below your peak, and if I compare to back then your HOKA revenue contribution has doubled in mix. So, just how should we think about that opportunity to get back to 53% or 54% gross margin over time?\nSteve Fasching: Yes, I think if you are looking back kind of two years ago, the big difference will be around just the promotion assumption. So, that was pretty clean, I would say, very clean selling in terms of hardly any promotion. You are right; as we are looking at the HOKA contribution increasing we are going to continue to see an increase. As we see a higher proportion of DTC increase, we will also see gross margin expansion. So, what you are seeing, I think this year from where we were a couple of years ago, similar assumption around promotion and we will see how that plays out this year, and then going forward beyond that is higher proportion of HOKA should continue to give us some gross margin expansion opportunities as well as the higher proportion of DTC business.\nJonathan Komp: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Dave, you had mentioned Teva and Sanuk, what is happening with those two brands now? How do you see their progress this year? And then, if you think about inventory levels, it certainly seems very clean, how you're looking for the progress of inventory going forward? Thank you.\nDave Powers: Yes, thanks, Dana, good question. We don't talk very often about Teva and Sanuk, and from the quarter results it makes sense there is questions about them. We recently have reorganized our smaller brands, Teva, Sanuk, and some incubation work that we're doing, and emerging brands for leveraging resources, and we are resetting those brands. So, we have a new leader there, Lee Cox, who spent a lot of time in the HOKA brand early days, he is appointed to get a long-term strategy for both of those brands, and right now they're doing brand works, so, resetting their positioning, tightening their positioning and proposition, understanding who their consumers are deeply, and elevating their innovation pipeline. So, I would say the biggest opportunity right now that we see down the road in the short and long-term is Teva. We have looked at a number of brands externally that we could acquire, and quite honestly, none of them look as good as Teva does. It's a beloved brand. It's got a great 30-plus year history, and a lot of heritage product. And it's healthy in the marketplace. It's got great margins, and we think that is a brand that we invest in for the long-term. So, right now it's just about resetting the marketplace. That's where you're seeing some degradation in the top line, and both Teva and Sanuk were cleaning things up, and we basically getting -- gearing those up to go back at it with a new and improved version of both brands. But the Teva opportunity is continued within sports sandal, and we are working on trail sandals for that brand, we are going to be launching early next year, which we think will be clearly exciting, trail running sandals, and then, also expanding into closed toe and year-around business through our innovation engine. So, we won't see dramatic changes in this year in the P&L for any perspective, but you will start to see improvement going into FY'25, both on the top line and bottom line, particularly for the Teva brand that's a bigger opportunity. And then, we have some ideas of what Sanuk could be, and we will see if those play out over the next coming years as well.\nSteve Fasching: And then, Dana, just on the inventory, the way we are thinking about, so to your point, we have made significant improvements from our year-ago period, which we had more elevated inventory, a lot more in transit inventory. So, that has resolved and improved -- we are in a much better position this year. You will continue to see that improvement continue in the quarters of this year, won't necessarily be to the same percentage extent, but we were making improvements kind of all of last year. And so, you will continue to see us make improvements, not necessarily to the same level that you saw in Q1.\nDana Telsey: Got it. Thank you.\nSteve Fasching: Okay.\nDave Powers: Thanks, Dana.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session, and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Powers",
            "content": "Thanks, Erinn. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss another strong quarter for Deckers, starting off fiscal 2024 on the right path as we build towards delivering another year of great results. Our results give us increased confidence to achieve our updated outlook for full fiscal year 2024, which includes a raise to our prior expectations. For the first quarter, our performance slightly outpaced our expectations, with revenue increasing 10% versus last year, to $676 million, gross margin improving more than 300 basis points including beneficial brand and channel mix dynamics, and diluted earnings per share growing 45% to $2.41. Revenue growth versus last year was driven by our key areas of focus, with global HOKA expanding 27% to deliver $420 million, global DTC increasing 35% to represent 37% of portfolio revenue, up from 30% last year, and international UGG delivering strong growth. As anticipated, we had some offsets to the growth in the quarter due to timing dynamics in UGG U.S. wholesale, with accounts choosing to receive products for it later into the year as opposed to a frontloaded preference we saw in the last couple of years. As we look to best manage our wholesale account product flow, we also continue to monitor marketplace inventory levels to maintain a healthy omnichannel presence that services our end consumer in the best way possible, and preserves the premium nature of our brands. Our ability to propel the targeted opportunities of global HOKA, global DTC, and international UGG further demonstrates the success of our omnichannel marketplace management and strategic investments. We will continue to remain nimble in execution, as we always have, to deliver strong results on both the top and bottom line. With the continued execution of our long-term vision, we believe Deckers is emerging as a leading creator of compelling consumer connections through highly desirable products that infuse disruptive innovation across both fashion and performance. As a reminder, our long-term strategic vision remains focused on building HOKA into a multibillion-dollar major player in the performance athletic space, growing the UGG brand by connecting with consumers through elevated experiences and a segmented product offering, expanding our DTC business through consumer acquisition and retention, and driving international growth through strategic investments. Steve will provide further details around our increased forward-looking expectations later in the call. In the meantime, let's dive into the brand and channel performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, starting with the brand highlights. As mentioned, global HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year, to $420 million, a quarterly record, and the first time the brand eclipsed $400 million in a single quarter. The HOKA brand's well-managed ecosystem of access points continues to flourish. DTC was the primary growth driver in the quarter, increasing 63% versus last year, and accounting for approximately two-thirds of total brand growth. DTC growth was broad-based as each region grew the business more than 50% versus the prior year, global consumer acquisition increased 58%, global consumer retention increased 57%, and 18 to 34-year-old consumers in the U.S. increased 68%. This exceptional DTC demand resulted in an improvement in gross margin as HOKA maintained high levels of full-price selling, and continues to benefit from shifting a greater proportion of revenue mix to DTC. While the HOKA brand's DTC business is still predominantly ecommerce, our select retail stores are augmenting the brand's presence by increasing awareness and brand engagement with a physical presence in key strategic markets, creating personal consumer connections through community-oriented experiences, and broadening category adoption by showcasing the depth of the HOKA product offering. For these reasons, we expect to continue testing potential permanent locations through pop-up stores. We are excited about a couple of new doors that are in the pipeline, and look forward to sharing more soon. From a wholesale perspective, HOKA continues to drive growth and manage the marketplace to build market share in existing points of distribution, maintain high levels of full-price sell-through, increase category shelf space through differentiated products, and expand brand awareness with a broader consumer demographic. HOKA has preserved high levels of full-price sell-through, and remains one of the fastest turning brands within the majority of its wholesale accounts. We continue to tightly manage the marketplace inventory and closely monitor HOKA key performance indicators in the channel to ensure the brand maintains its premium positioning across its ecosystem of access points. As excess consumer demand materializes, we prefer that HOKA satisfies upside through the brand's DTC business, which is what we saw happen this quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum that HOKA has sustained across its distribution landscape, and continue to make investments to build awareness and affinity for the brand across key markets. In June, HOKA launched the second edition of its Fly Human Fly global marketing campaign, and is already seeing the benefits of this upgraded rollout. This edition of the campaign was designed to reinforce that HOKA stands for joyful and inclusive performance at its highest level. As campaign content and activations continue to roll out across the globe, HOKA has seen a powerful response from consumers in the first few weeks, including robust growth in online engagement across social channels and digital platforms, especially with the release of the campaign's focal film, titled, Murmuration, which embodies the brand ethos of moving together. Heightened attention brought directly to HOKA.com with the vast majority of digital campaign asset clicks yielding first-time visitors to our brand's ecommerce platform globally, more than doubling the conversion rate of HOKA.com landing page visitors, and significant impressions from out-of-home activations. We are optimistic about the reach and broad appeal of this campaign as HOKA continues to introduce itself to new consumers around the world. And the brand is as visible as it has ever been, with connected TV advertising, billboards, special running events, and several compelling activations in the pipeline. On the heels of the Fly Human Fly campaign rollout, HOKA launched the all-new Mach X, which was designed for propulsive everyday running, and features high-rebound cushioning and a Pebax plate. Mach X media content was seamlessly weaved into the Fly Human Fly launch. And HOKA further celebrated this innovative product creation with several regional activations to aid Mach X awareness, including a demo run, in Germany, where participants were challenged to run as far as they could for 30 minutes, a sprint relay in France across a two-kilometer loop, in [Les Deux, Chamonix] (ph), a college event in Eugene, Oregon, hosting demo community runs to celebrate the U.S. Track and Field Championships, and a two-day HOKA experience clinic at our retail store in Japan, and at a popup location in Thailand. These global events, combined with the connected TV, social media, and digital out-of-home content have created significant energy behind the HOKA brand's latest shoe innovation. The Mach X was treated as an exclusive launch in our own DTC channel, and with our run specialty partners as we continue to work towards greater segmentation of the HOKA brand's compelling product line. Just a few weeks into the second quarter, the Mach X is close to cracking the top 10 sales globally on HOKA.com, and we are getting great feedback so far from our run specialty partners. HOKA continues to build a bigger business through the expansion and increased adoption of its lineup of innovative products. We see the Mach X as an incremental addition to the already stellar portfolio of our footwear, led by the brand's most popular styles, Clifton and Bondi. The Mach is a great example of franchise development where the team has innovated upon the original Mach which continues to perform exceptionally well, by introducing the snappier and more competitive version, the Mach X. It is with this approach to product line management that HOKA is able to broaden the aperture of HOKA consumers, while maintaining pinnacle positioning in the performance athletic space. HOKA has an amazing roster of athletes around the world who are competing at the highest level, and achieving incredible results wearing commercially available versions of our shoes. During this past quarter, HOKA athlete, Cole Watson finished first in the Canyons Endurance 100K wearing the HOKA Tecton X carbon-plated trail running shoe. Congratulations to Cole who, with this victory, punched his ticket to the UTMB Mont-Blanc, a HOKA-sponsored event to be held in Chamonix, France, at the end of August. Moving to UGG, global revenue in the first quarter decreased 6% versus last year, to $196 million. As expected, this decline resulted from lapping earlier wholesale shipping patterns over the last couple of years in the U.S. UGG was able to offset this challenging compare in the U.S. with the strength of the brand's international regions. International strength was broad-based across multiple regions, and in both wholesale and DTC channels. In particular, our EMEA region, as well as China, which benefited from lapping lower demand from lockdowns in the prior year, drove above average growth. These regions found success attracting consumers with more transitional styles, like the Ultra Mini, Tasman, and Classic Mini, as well as seasonal franchises, like the Goldenstar and LA Cloud. We are encouraged by the continued progress of international regions to increase the adoption of key global franchises year-round. Part of the excitement behind these franchises is being driven by the brand's more focused approach to product marketing, creating greater global alignment of key stories. With this more focused approach; UGG is maintaining high levels of brand heat with more consumers actively searching for the brand. During the first quarter, online search interest across Europe increased 60% versus last year, with outsized strength in the U.K. and France. The same is true in the U.S., where search interest increased 21% versus last year according to Google Trends. UGG brand momentum also benefited from this spring's Feel House activation at Coachella. The Feel House, first launched in the fall of 2022, is a multisensory community experience dedicated to making self-expression comfortable for all. UGG invited individuals from around the world to experience this latest iteration of the Feel House, which was designed as an oasis for creatives, in Palm Springs, California. The Feel House was decorated with signature artwork from New York City-based artist, KidSuper, who partnered with UGG to design a quick-strike collaboration of the Tasman X, whose global activation drove significant press coverage with the likes of influential publications, such as Esquire, Teen Vogue, Daily Mail, and Hypebeast. As a result of the UGG team's continued brand activations and compelling products, UGG global DTC increased 6% versus last year. UGG experienced consumer demand both in stores and online. We have been particularly excited by the interest of consumers who are shopping in person, especially during the spring and summer seasons. We believe this dynamic is partly attributable to the development and greater adoption of transitional franchises that embrace the brand's heritage DNA and have greater year-round wearing occasions. By maintaining this momentum, the entire UGG product portfolio benefits, especially in our stores, where consumers can feel and directly engage with the broader product offering. For this reason, and in line with our focus on elevate the UGG brand in an influential international market, subsequent to quarter-end, we opened our newest flagship store in the high tourist traffic Harajuku shopping district of Tokyo. With the first quarter behind us, we remain confident in executing the UGG plan we outlined for fiscal year 2024, evidenced by the continued momentum of global markets as consumers actively search for UGG, growth of global direct-to-consumer with improved margins from full-price business, and strength of iconic silhouettes like the Ultra Mini and Tasman driving year-round excitement. Entering the second quarter, the UGG team is working hard to state its global omnichannel marketplace to connect with consumers through engaging experiences in the autumn/winter season. To execute this vision, UGG will be expanding on and embracing the celebration of culture and community by creating meaningful experiences, such as the Feel House, that serve as an invitation to develop and emotional connection with the brand. This fall, UGG will celebrate its brand heritage through consumer-centric moments around the world, with new winter lifestyle-themed Feel House executions, an exciting new winter product aimed at capturing more of the winter fashion and resort-focused consumer. Shifting to our discussion of consolidated channel performance, global direct-to-consumer drove first quarter revenue growth, increasing 35% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and 33% on a comparable basis. Strength in the channel was driven by continued increases in HOKA consumer acquisition and retention globally. HOKA consumer growth was robust across regions and various age demographics, with outsized growth among international markets and the 18-34 year-old cohort, which remain key targets for us. The UGG DTC business also experienced growth, driven by more than 20% increase internationally, that benefited from China catching up from lockdowns in the prior year. The strength in China resulted from increased adoption of both sneaker and sandal styles. From a wholesale perspective, global revenue was down 1%, as gains in HOKA were offset by UGG U.S. shipment timing realignment to pre-pandemic cadence, as well as a continued focus to manage the marketplace inventory of our brands to maintain high levels of full price selling in this more promotional consumer landscape. Overall, we are pleased with the China results, which reflect the power of our marketplace management strategies that continue to benefit our wholesale partners, DTC business, and ultimately Deckers bottom line. With that, I will hand the call over to Steve to provide further details on our first quarter financial results as well as our increased outlook for fiscal year 2024. Steve? Thanks, Steve. Fiscal year 2024 is off to a nice start, with HOKA continuing its strong momentum, and the balance of our brand portfolio on track to our full-year expectations. While keeping our long-term strategies top of mind, we are operating fiscal year 2024 with a sharp focus to prioritize DTC growth across all of our brands, while managing wholesale marketplace inventory to drive online acquisition in a high level of full price selling, expand HOKA brand awareness globally, lead with UGG products that are proven to resonate with global consumers, thoughtfully manage inventory to align with consumer demand, and invest in enterprise infrastructure in key strategic growth areas. We believe Deckers' unique ability to introduce exciting innovation into both fashion and performance products, is why our differentiated brands are able to create lasting consumer connections. This along with our financial discipline, agile operating platform, exceptional marketplace management and purpose-led culture allow us to continue to deliver best-in-class results, and exceptional shareholder value. On behalf of our management team, I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to delivering results and making Deckers a great place to work. And I would also like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator? Yes, thanks, Jay. So, yes, obviously we are super excited about the continued momentum of HOKA, broad-based, it's just continuing to meet or exceed expectations for us, and we're really optimistic about the rest of the year. DTC growth, as you saw from both brands, was exceptional. Wholesale for HOKA is about where we expected it to be for this quarter; couple puts and takes here and there by channel and region. But generally speaking, right in line with our marketplace management expectations. We love how this flywheel is working for us. We're creating awareness out in the marketplace at a top level of the funnel. The awareness is increasing dramatically for the brand, up 20% over last year. And that's driving all channels, but particularly, as designed, into DTC. So, there's some noise out in the wholesale channel with markdowns and promotions from other brands, a lot of inventory in the channel, so we're managing that tightly by purpose. But again, as I say, raising awareness at a high level and seeing the brand interest coming directly to our DTC business is super exciting for us. Obviously it's our most profitable sale. We gain all the data from that and it creates even a stronger flywheel going forward in the marketplace as we expand globally. Some of the things that are driving HOKA for the quarter, this was a HOKA-driven quarter, as expected, right? So, this isn't a big quarter for UGG. A lot of the top-selling styles for the company overall for the quarter were driven by HOKA. Again, the Clifton and the Bondi continue to be the frontrunners here. The Clifton 9 has been received extremely well globally, and we're looking to get more inventory into that franchise and continuing the upside of that franchise going forward. And then also in the hike side of things, that business is still very strong. In places like REI, we're the number one running brand, and also in hike. And then in the international regions, particularly in China, we have a very strong hike business. So, we're going to continue to go after that. We've got some new innovations launching. We just launched the Mach X, which has been received very well with the PEBA plate, and there's a little more attainable price point, and then continuing to update franchises throughout the year with some very, very exciting launches of existing upgrades, but also some new product coming into Q4. You bet. I can speak to that, and then, Steve, you want to get into specifics. Yes, this is -- like we're doing with everything else in our marketplace, we like to test and learn. And when we see positive signs we like to go fast and capture opportunities, and so far, very good on retail. Fortunately for us, we know how to run retail stores based on our legacy of UGG retail stores over the last 20 years, we have the operations globally to do it, and we're leveraging that platform exceptionally well. The stores that we have opened, both pop-ups and permanent, are exceeding or on plan, no concerns as of this point. But we do want to take it slow. We want to make sure we're not overextending ourselves; we're going into markets that are accretive to the overall marketplace strategy, but are also creating awareness to important consumers in key locations around the globe. We need retail to work in China. We can't have a distributor business with partners if we don't know how to do retail very well, so we're fine-tuning that. But, so far, the partners are pleased. We're very positive and optimistic about our own retail stores there as well. Excited to open our first permanent store in New York City, feedback from that has been exceptional. And I think for us, now, it's really about fine-tuning the experience for the consumer in the stores. So, the operations and the behind the scenes, we have dialed, but we want to make sure this is an exceptional experience for the consumer beyond just the product. We're looking at holding events and run clubs, and making sure that there is engagement with the community in these stores as well to drive renewed interest or renewed -- sorry, I should say repeat visits from existing customers, but also creating awareness and showing the full breadth of the line for new customers to the brand. So, off to a good start. Small in the scheme of things at this point, but we see upside here. And as far as size of stores and how many, we don't have a number put on that yet. It all depends on how the marketplace evolves. But DTC is our primary objective here. And using our stores to grow online, and vice versa. But you'll see a handful of key stores being opened in key cities and locations as we go, and continuing to leverage our popup and test model before we make long-term commitments. Yes. Yes, so just on -- with Stefano, super excited to elevate him to that role, well-deserved. And we spoke on the last call, I believe, the HOKA business is in excellent shape under Stefano's leadership. He knows this space incredibly well, and we're excited about the fast-tracking of innovation and marketplace management that's happening there. No news to report yet on the HOKA full-time president replacement. But I would say, trust that we're confident in the business until we do, and we'll be excited to announce that when the time comes. Yes, I think one thing to note is we -- sorry, Sam. We do have hard comps coming forward in the next three quarters, just something to be aware of. But I think we're learning what's possible with our DTC engine here. And so, this is very encouraging signs for us. The thing to keep in mind also is wholesale is a bit of a uncertain entity right now with inventory in the channel, there's a lot of estimates it's going to be a promotional back-half for the year. So, the way we're looking at this is we're trying to focus on the total consumer opportunity regardless of channel, and have the inventory available for our DTC business if whole continues to be a little bit more challenging or promotional, we're confident that they'll come to us, and with our marketing campaigns at the top of the funnel we can drive more direct -- target traffic directly to our channels and DTC channels. But this is certainly very encouraging, it's right in line with our strategy to get the whole company at 50% DTC down the road. And we're going to continue the hammer away at it. Yes, and I think, this is from my perspective, I want to make sure that we have the operations at Deckers to take this business to $5 billion, $6 billion over the coming years. And so, we want to make sure, and I've said to my leadership team that we need to focus on infrastructure investment, innovation, the systems, data accessibility, global supply chain investments, DCs, that so we are ready for the growth when it continues to come. And in the past, some quarters we've pushed out marketing spend because we didn't need it to hit our numbers, but we're rethinking this. We're much more strategic now. We want to make sure we're doing more activity at the top of the funnel, connected TV, et cetera. And we have some great created from both HOKA and UGG that you'll on connected TV this coming season, in fall. And the ELT is completely aligned on where additional SG&A opportunities are going to go and how we prioritize them. So, if we see signs that there is opportunity to free up some more spend for some of these strategic initiatives, Steve and I are looking at it quick, we're allocating the money fast so that teams can get on with it and create more upside. But I am excited about the opportunities of marketing for HOKA specifically, but also UGG, and UGG men's, and some new exciting product launches coming this fall for both of them, and on the marketing side too. Thanks, Sam. Yes, good questions. This is a -- it's always a funny quarter for UGG because we're dealing with deliveries into wholesale, getting ready for fall, we have some leftover from spring, and we're comping -- particularly this quarter, for UGG, we're coming a lot of fluff business from last year. So, it is a little bit noisy. But the good news that we're seeing in here is how the consumers are reacting. Brand interest is up dramatically, especially in 18 to 34-year-olds. The styles that we have invested in with heavy inventory, this coming fall, the Tasman and the Ultra Mini and platform styles. We sold out of those styles last year. We're getting back in inventory now. They're already selling through very well despite the heat waves that are going around across the country. So, the indicators that we are seeing for the UGG brand, consumer interest, consumer buzz, excitement around these franchise styles, and even a couple of new styles that we just launched early, a sneaker and then a -- it's more -- I forget the name of it, but it's an UGG style that has a knit upper on it. Those are in the top 10 of UGG.com, so, a lot of reasons to be excited. Wholesale partners, they know they need UGG to be successful this season. They know that there is opportunity in these key styles that we're getting after, and those are the things that we have focused our buys on for them. The other key thing to keep in mind is we have reduced our SKU count dramatically in UGG. So, last year at this time, we were over 600 SKUs heading into fall. This year, we're just over 400. And so, we've cleaned up the assortment. We've funneled our inventory into these key styles that we know there is high demand for. And we're getting the marketing behind those styles to really drive high level of interest and sell-through. On the traditional styles, one of the top selling styles globally is the Scuffette. And so, we're still seeing a lot of interest and renewed interest with younger consumers in some of our core classics. But what's really encouraging is the iterations with the platform style really leveraging the Tasman, the Neumel, these Ultra Mini styles, and then new iterations that we're going to be launching in the fall and holiday. We've just been through a great deal of work under Anne and the marketing team's leadership on resetting our brand positioning and defining our brand codes and design, and applying those to our core classics, and iterating off of those with new materials, and new outsoles, and different shapes is bringing some really exciting product to market. And I think you're going to see some of that start to happen this fall, and continue through spring, and next fall as well. Yes, short and long-term, right? And so, I just reviewed with the leadership team yesterday, the fall '24 line. And the teams all said to us, \"Listen, this is -- we're doing less work, and the styles that we're spending more time on are getting better and better, and more exciting.\" And so, I think you're going to see both in focused, you're going to see it in quality in aesthetic and design, and you're ultimately going to see a margin opportunity a little bit as well. We haven't flushed that out yet, and we don't have it in any of the guidance or anything, but certainly when brands go through this work there is certainly opportunity for margin savings. Thank you. Yes, it was sum of both in the quarter. Sure, Kelly. There is a lot in there. Let me try to thrive some of that. So, you are right, we did do, and Italian distributor conversion, so that is impacting. A year ago Q1 would have picked up the distributor order, which would have covered multiple quarters in the wholesale model. So, you are seeing some kind of delay of those sales in the Italy market. We have not talked about how much that is, but not a huge number and a Q1 impact, but safe to say, within millions of dollars in terms of what the impact was. But you will see pick up in the wholesale business later. So, that was impacting some of the wholesale distributor growth in Q1. Then the other parts of your question were... Yes. So, what we are looking at just in terms of with specific to HOKA door account, wholesale, is what your question was? Yes, I think the way we are looking at it is, on our prior call we talked about kind of no global net new doors. We are going to continue to evaluate and see what that looks like. We are probably seeing some growth in North America, and some declines on the international business as we are cleaning up some of that distribution. And then we will continue to monitor. So, that was kind of point in time as we see demand and performance with these doors within accounts will continue to evaluate that. But no change in strategy. Yes. Thank you. Yes, let me grab my LRP necessarily. That's just generally speaking, like, my job as CEO I need to be looking three to five years out, you know, and based off where we are today and on the cash flow hitting $4 billion mark, my head is like, \"Okay, so do we get to $5 billion and $6 billion, what it's going to take from the team perspective and infrastructure perspective, category expansion, all those things.\" So, when I put out, say, $5 billion or $6 billion, that's just generally thinking, \"Hey, down the road, we are going to get to these numbers. I don't have anything to share with how that is.\" But certainly if you put the pieces together you could see it happening as well, with the current growth we are seeing. In HOKA, I think you're going to see a resurgence of UGG over the coming years in Anne's leadership, and hopefully we get Teva to be a meaningful number in the coming years as well. So, it's within line of sight for sure, but I don't want to put a timeline or brand mix or any of that yet, it's early days, but the opportunity we see is this company to be a $5 billion-$6 billion business over time for sure. Yes, we are in the transform; myself right now have trouble finding it honestly. So, that one surprised us. I was actually little bit skeptical about how that was going to received in the marketplace. It's not necessarily positioned as a performance shoe, although I do running it and work out in it, and so, it's very versatile. But I think it's showing us that there is more aperture and appetite for HOKA to being meaningful in the lifestyle space, whether that is color ups or fabric changes or design details and some of our franchise styles. We pull things out of the vault. I mean we're 10-year-old now, we have things actually in the vault that customers ask for. But there is opportunity for new styles like the Transport and the TransportX that we tested this year. And we think that there is emerging opportunity in lifestyle, it's not just people wearing a running shoe anymore, they want shoes made for all day wear, that feel like running shoes, but have a little bit of a different aesthetic, and we see a massive opportunity there not only within the HOKA brand, but we are working on launching a new brand actually in Spring's timeframe, to go after some of that opportunity as well. So, as far as category growth, right now if you ask Stefano and the team, we are focused on being to maintaining our dominant position in run, we want to be number one in hike and trail over the coming years. We think that's a tremendous opportunity, and that's an important category that's growing within the category, but also has lifestyle implications as well, and then really cultivating the lifestyle, distribution and consumer with performance product that has a little bit of a different aesthetic. If you think about down the road, different categories, we are exploring other categories as well, and those things take time to develop. So, we are having the teams on the sidelines looking at different opportunities, like different categories, whether it's court shoes or whatever that maybe. But we are thinking that way for the long-term, but right now we are really focused on run, hike and the lifestyle opportunity. Yes, thanks, Dana, good question. We don't talk very often about Teva and Sanuk, and from the quarter results it makes sense there is questions about them. We recently have reorganized our smaller brands, Teva, Sanuk, and some incubation work that we're doing, and emerging brands for leveraging resources, and we are resetting those brands. So, we have a new leader there, Lee Cox, who spent a lot of time in the HOKA brand early days, he is appointed to get a long-term strategy for both of those brands, and right now they're doing brand works, so, resetting their positioning, tightening their positioning and proposition, understanding who their consumers are deeply, and elevating their innovation pipeline. So, I would say the biggest opportunity right now that we see down the road in the short and long-term is Teva. We have looked at a number of brands externally that we could acquire, and quite honestly, none of them look as good as Teva does. It's a beloved brand. It's got a great 30-plus year history, and a lot of heritage product. And it's healthy in the marketplace. It's got great margins, and we think that is a brand that we invest in for the long-term. So, right now it's just about resetting the marketplace. That's where you're seeing some degradation in the top line, and both Teva and Sanuk were cleaning things up, and we basically getting -- gearing those up to go back at it with a new and improved version of both brands. But the Teva opportunity is continued within sports sandal, and we are working on trail sandals for that brand, we are going to be launching early next year, which we think will be clearly exciting, trail running sandals, and then, also expanding into closed toe and year-around business through our innovation engine. So, we won't see dramatic changes in this year in the P&L for any perspective, but you will start to see improvement going into FY'25, both on the top line and bottom line, particularly for the Teva brand that's a bigger opportunity. And then, we have some ideas of what Sanuk could be, and we will see if those play out over the next coming years as well. Thanks, Dana."

            "name": "Steve Fasching",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave just covered, Deckers delivered strong results in the first quarter and demonstrated great progress toward our full fiscal year and raised outlook. HOKA was the driver of growth in the quarter, lead by strong performance in the DTC channel, and UGG continues to elevate its presence globally, as represented by international growth. As anticipated, UGG's global revenue was lower than last year, primarily due to lapping earlier selling during the prior year. But the brand maintains high levels of consumer interest, capturing increased demand through our DTC in the quarter. As we continue to operate in a very dynamic consumer environment, we remain committed to executing against our strategic priorities, and maintaining our disciplined approach to managing our business. We are encouraged by the demand signals we are seeing, and believe our portfolio of leading brands continues to resonate with consumers globally. With that, let's get into the details of our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results. Revenue was $676 million, up 10% versus prior year. HOKA revenue increased 27% versus last year, due to the exceptional demand experienced across the brand's DTC channel and global ecosystem of access points. Gross margins for the quarter were 51.3%, which is up 330 basis points from last year's 48%. First quarter gross margin benefited from lower freight costs, a greater mix of HOKA brand revenue, and an increased mix of DTC business with slight offsets from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the same period last year, and select closeouts of seasonal inventory. SG&A dollar spent in the first quarter was $276 million, which is up 16% from last year's $238 million. SG&A growth was driven by reinvestment in key areas of the business in support of our growth targets, which includes strategic marketing, including the spend intended to amplify HOKA awareness in leading international markets, supply chain footprint to match the growing scale of our organization, enhanced e-commerce capabilities, and talent across the organization, including areas we've delayed in the enterprise support functions. Our tax rate was 21.9%, which compares to 21.3% in the prior year. These results coupled with higher interest income and a lower share count as a result of our share repurchases program drove diluted earnings per share of $2.41 for the quarter, which was $0.75 above last year's $1.66 per share, representing growth of 45%. Turning to our balance sheet, at June 30, 2023, we ended June with $1.05 billion of cash and equivalents. Inventory was $741 million, down 12% versus the same point in time last year, and we had no outstanding borrowings. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $25 million worth of shares at an average price of $485.95. As of June 30, 2023, the company had approximately $1.3 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. Now, moving on to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2024, with the HOKA brand's DTC business exceeding our expectation in the first quarter, we are increasing our full-year top line revenue guidance to be approximately $3.98 billion from our previous range of approximately $3.95 billion. This increase represents full-year growth expectations of approximately 10% versus the prior year. As a result of this update, we now expect HOKA growth to exceed 20% for the fiscal year 2024, compared to fiscal year 2023, with the majority of growth anticipated to come from the brand's direct-to-consumer business. UGG revenue is still expected to increase low single-digits, driven by international expansion and a focus on driving more business to DTC. Beyond our updated revenue outlook for full fiscal year 2024, gross margin is still expected to be approximately 52%, representing a more than 150 basis point improvement relative to last year. SG&A is still expected to be approximately 34% of revenue, as we re-invest gross margin improvements in key areas of the business. Operating margin is still expected to be approximately 18%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be 22% to 23%, and we are increasing our diluted earnings per share expectation now to be in the range of $21.75 to $22.25. The $0.65 increase is related to the increased expectation for HOKA DTC and an increased expectation for interest income as we benefit from working capital improvements, including inventory management, driving higher cash balances that are earning at a higher interest rate. Please note, this guidance excludes any charges that maybe considered one-time in nature, and does not contemplate any impact from future share repurchases. Additionally, our guidance assumes no meaningful deterioration of current risks and uncertainties, which includes but not limited to supply chain disruptions, constraints, and related expenses, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer confidence, and recessionary pressures, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in our disciplined operating model, well-positioned brands, robust financial profile, and ability to remain nimble as we adapt to evolving marketplace dynamics. Thanks, everyone, And I will now hand the call back to Dave for his final remarks. Sure. Yes, Laurent, this is Steve. Just on the number, you're right, 16 are the company-owned stores, so that does not include retail partners that we have in Asia or with some of our distributors. So, those are not included in the store count. So, the 16 -- sorry, 18 are included are company-owned, not inclusive of some of our retail partners as well. And then just as Dave said, I think the performance of those has exceeded our expectations, both from a revenue and a profit standpoint. And we use the pop-ups to inform us on locations. So, as we see pop-ups perform very well, it gives us a good indication of store location and opportunity for a permanent location. And we'll continue to operate in that manner. And we continue to look at area where we can continue to expand the HOKA retail store presence. And then just on the capital allocation question, no change in terms of how we're thinking about it. Clearly, like to operate from a position of strength, so have an incredibly strong balance sheet, especially in current times, I think that serves us well, constant conversation with our Board in terms of how we're looking at capital allocation. But as we've indicated over prior quarters, we have been and look at share repurchase as a great way to return value to our shareholder base. So, we'll continue to look at that and evaluate that. But yes, in terms of how we're thinking about it, no change. And we'll continue to have conversations with our Board. Thank you. Yes, I think -- that's a good question. Right, clearly we've seen DTC perform slightly above our expectation in Q1. We've reflected that in the raised guidance for the year. And we're continuing to watch that. As part of -- and Dave articulated this a little bit, part of our strategy is to manage the wholesale marketplace tightly. And we'll let some of that excess demand come over into our DTC channel, and we'll fulfill there. But a little bit harder to gauge how that consumer shows up, but we're confident in our ability to grow DTC, and with HOKA specifically. And we'll see how the year plays out. But what we're encouraged by is a strong start to the year, continue to see growth in our DTC business, and growth with our HOKA DTC business. And then we'll see how the year continues to play out. Yes, I think the way we're looking at it, Sam, is we're coming out of a year, last year, our FY '23, where we held back on some of those SG&A investments, and that was to offset some of the headwinds that we were experiencing on the gross margin. So, that was an intentional holdback to really deliver on our commitment to get to 18% operating margin. So, this year, as we're seeing some of that gross margin expansion, it is affording us that opportunity to invest. So, we are looking at it, that's embedded in our guidance for the year, of the approximate 18% operating margin, so again, with that gross margin expansion, taking that opportunity to invest in some of those things that we held back on last year. And we'll see how we're doing. I think Q1 is a demonstration where we have invested a little bit more, so you're seeing a little bit of an increase on that SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the quarter. So, we'll continue to see. But I think it's important that we continue to invest in these brands, part of that, as I mentioned, strategic investment in HOKA marketing. We know that there is an incredible opportunity out there, and this is an opportunity for us to continue to build international brand awareness. And then just on kind of the infrastructure in town, we're in the competitive space. And with how well we're doing, it's important for us to remain competitive in that space as well. So, those are all things that we're considering. But again, we're delivering, in my mind, exceptional operating profit levels, and so it affords us the opportunity with this gross margin expansion to make those investments. Kelly, this is Steve. I think on the quarter, we pretty much delivered kind of to our expectation. I know some of the models may have been a little bit higher than we were. My guess is where you may have been a little bit higher was around a promotion assumption and potentially a foreign currency assumption. When we look at the 330 beat, that's a pretty substantial beat, in line with what were thinking. Just to give you some sense of how that broke down, the freight channel mix in brand was around 450 basis points of it, and that was offset by about 100 basis points which was a mix of promo and foreign currency. So, just depending on how you factored that into your model, but generally speaking, in line, but yes, as we mentioned we did do some closed out to seasonal items in Q1, which is impacting that gross margin. HOKA wholesale in general and door account. But no real change in strategy. Yes, I think if you are looking back kind of two years ago, the big difference will be around just the promotion assumption. So, that was pretty clean, I would say, very clean selling in terms of hardly any promotion. You are right; as we are looking at the HOKA contribution increasing we are going to continue to see an increase. As we see a higher proportion of DTC increase, we will also see gross margin expansion. So, what you are seeing, I think this year from where we were a couple of years ago, similar assumption around promotion and we will see how that plays out this year, and then going forward beyond that is higher proportion of HOKA should continue to give us some gross margin expansion opportunities as well as the higher proportion of DTC business. And then, Dana, just on the inventory, the way we are thinking about, so to your point, we have made significant improvements from our year-ago period, which we had more elevated inventory, a lot more in transit inventory. So, that has resolved and improved -- we are in a much better position this year. You will continue to see that improvement continue in the quarters of this year, won't necessarily be to the same percentage extent, but we were making improvements kind of all of last year. And so, you will continue to see us make improvements, not necessarily to the same level that you saw in Q1. Okay."
