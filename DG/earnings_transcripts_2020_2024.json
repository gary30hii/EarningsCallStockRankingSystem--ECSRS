At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 18, 2021. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Inves Relations and Corporate Strategy.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2020, and I thank all of our associates for their extraordinary efforts over the past year to support our customers, our communities and each other. Despite a challenging operating environment, our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of Serving Others by providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. And I could not be more proud of their efforts. \n Throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer. In response to the COVID pandemic, we implemented several safety protocols; enhanced our benefits and leave policies; invested in personnel and personnel protective equipment; dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities; and most recently, removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine. In total, we invested approximately $248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020, including about $167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year. \n At Dollar General, we remain committed to being part of the solution and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of U.S. population. At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. \n To that end, we're excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021. First, we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives, including our nonconsumables initiative, Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh. In addition, while still early, we are very pleased with the results of our POP SHELF stores, which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. As a result, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for POP SHELF in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger-format Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept. \n We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy, including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus store, or DGP, and the introduction of 2 new store formats, which we began testing in 2020. Similar to our larger-footprint DGP concept, the first new format has a selling space of approximately 8,500 square feet, which compares to about 7,300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store. Beginning later this year, this new format, along with our DGP concept, will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores, replacing both our traditional and higher cooler count DGTP formats, allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth. \n Our second new format is even larger with approximately 9,500 square selling feet and will be deployed opportunistically across new store, relocation and remodel opportunities. Notably, on average, our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store, which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead. \n Finally, we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the continental United States, which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. \n But first, let's recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're pleased that for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories. \n From a multi-cadence perspective, comp sales in December increased in the high single-digit range, with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January. In total, fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%. These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they are spending more with us compared to last year. \n Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019. These new customers continue to skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. \n We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers, and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. We're particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to fourth quarter diluted EPS of $2.62, an increase of 24.8% over the prior year. For the full year, net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, including net sales growth of 28.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories. Comp sales for the year increased 16.3%, representing our 31st consecutive year of same-store sales growth. \n In 2020, we celebrated the opening of our 17,000th store and the launch of our newest store concept, POP SHELF. In total, we completed a record 2,780 real estate projects during the year, exceeding our initial target of 2,580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth. \n From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in other key areas, including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. Collectively, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. \n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. \n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences, we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. \n Overall, I am proud of our associates and all that we've achieved over the past year. We feel very good about the underlying business and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. \n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points, which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to: a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. \n These factors were partially offset by: increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million. As a percent of sales, operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year. \n Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 24.8% to $2.62, which contributed to full year EPS of $10.62, an increase of 59.9%. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 12.2% overall and 6.3% on a per-store basis. While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels. \n In 2020, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion or 73.2%. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $87 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.4 billion under the repurchase program. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. \n Moving to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can, based on what we currently know. That said, there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year, which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear, including, but not limited to: the recently approved government stimulus package, other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis, including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates. \n With this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021: net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat; a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6% but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20%, or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%. \n Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns, as outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.42 per share, which represents an increase of 16.7%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Finally, as noted in today's press release, our outlook for 2021 real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q3 earnings release on December 3, 2020. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. Despite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a 2-year stack basis. From the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%. \n Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year. That said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1. \n Turning to gross margin. In 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin nonconsumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate. However, the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain. \n Gross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive nonconsumable categories. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020, which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year. \n In addition, while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses, including further expansion of our private fleet, are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021. Also, please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020. \n In terms of SG&A, while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to last year. However, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. \n With regard to our strategic initiatives, in aggregate, we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. \n Finally, we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February. \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities, including our strategic initiatives and plans for 2021. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a fantastic job in 2020, executing against our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts as we look to further build on our progress in 2021.\n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 5,800 stores at the end of 2020, including nearly 400 stores in our light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,600 stores at year-end. \n Given our strong performance to date, we plan to expand this offering to about 5,700 additional stores this year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than 11,000 by year-end. This total includes over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach. \n Moving to our newest concept, POP SHELF, which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with about 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. We opened our first 5 locations in 2020. And as Todd mentioned, given our strong results to date, we plan to accelerate the rollout of POP SHELF in 2021. In fact, we are now targeting to have a total of up to 50 POP SHELF stores opened by year-end compared to our previous goal of about 30 total locations. \n In addition to these stores, we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021. \n In terms of our store-within-a-store concept, a smaller footprint POP SHELF shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store, and we will display both Dollar General and POP SHELF branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness. From these initial stores, our goal is to test, learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with POP SHELF by making it more available to a broader range of customers. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. Given our success to date, we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products, including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment while increasing our relevance with customers. \n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 16,000 stores from 10 facilities at the end of 2020. This compares to our previous expectation of over 14,000 stores at year-end. Overall, we remain well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021. \n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During 2020, we added more than 62,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2021 as we continue to build on our multiyear track record for growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n As a reminder, in 2019, we began incorporating high-capacity coolers into the majority of our new, remodeled and relocated stores, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. \n Next, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient customer package pickup and dropoff service is now available in over 8,500 stores, with plans to be in a total of over 9,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. \n With regards to our supply chain, our plans for 2021 include further expansion of our private fleet, which accounted for more than 20% of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020. Reducing stem miles is also an important contributor to these efforts, and the recent opening of our Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead. \n We also plan to open 2 additional DG Fresh facilities in 2021 as we look to further optimize our fresh network and support future growth. In addition, we anticipate our combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska will be completed in late 2022,  which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles over time. \n Finally, while we are very pleased with our progress in 2020, shrink reduction remains an important area of opportunity. We continue to build on our success with electronic article surveillance by increasing the number of items tagged while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2020, we completed a total of 2,780 real estate projects, including 1,000 new stores, 1,670 remodels and 110 relocations. Additionally, we now have produce in more than 1,100 stores. For 2021, we expect to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also plan to add produce in approximately 700 stores, bringing the total number of stores that carry produce to more than 1,800. \n In addition, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to advance the evolution of our store base with plans to build on the success of our DGP format, including the introduction of 2 new format types. With about 8,500 square feet of selling space, both our first new format and DGP concept allow for expanded higher capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores. In total, we expect more than 550 of our overall real estate projects this year to be in one of these format types as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America. \n The second new format consists of about 9,500 square feet of selling space. In addition to an extended queue line and broader assortment, this larger layout also includes nearly 50 high-capacity coolers and expanded produce offering, fresh meat and additional checkout lanes, including a self-checkout bullpen with multiple stations. We believe this even larger format better positions us to meet the growing needs of our customers, particularly in highly underserved markets, and we are targeting more than 100 locations by year-end. \n Overall, these larger formats allow us to incorporate our best and most impactful initiatives and are designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format all while continuing to drive strong returns. \n Moving to an update on the number of new store opportunities. Through a combination of our growing relevance with customers, format innovation, an evolving retail landscape and leveraging new technologies, we estimate there are now approximately 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities in the continental U.S. which are available for a Dollar General store. This compares to our prior estimate of nearly 12,000 opportunities and is inclusive of our 2021 new unit pipeline. \n Although these opportunities are available to all small-box retailers, as a leader in small-box retail, combined with our proven track record of new unit development and format innovation, we believe we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share as we move ahead. And while we continue to evaluate, we are currently -- we currently estimate POP SHELF could add approximately 3,000 additional store opportunities in the Continental U.S., with about another 1,000 additional opportunities available for our smaller footprint DGX format. \n When taken together, we estimate there are a total of approximately 17,000 new store opportunities available across our format types, which we believe represents a long runway for new unit growth. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. \n We made significant progress in 2020, highlighted by the accelerated rollout of DG Pickup, our Buy Online Pick Up In-store offering to more than 17,000 stores, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience. During the year, we also saw continued growth in customer engagement across our digital ecosystem, including our digital coupon offering, shopping list feature, cart calculator shopping and budgeting tool, e-commerce site, DG GO! mobile checkout and our mobile app, which ended the year with nearly 4 million monthly active users. \n Looking ahead, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement and loyalty. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. \n We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 1,600 stores at the end of 2020, with plans for an aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we expect to introduce this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. And for those associates already on our team, this growth is resulting in numerous opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as POP SHELF. \n In addition, we transitioned to a virtual learning environment in 2020, resulting in the continued development of our people, including nearly 3 million training hours for our employees, all supported by our award-winning training and development programs. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. We have a robust set of initiatives in place for 2021 and are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. \n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance and our 2020 results, which further demonstrate our unique combination of value and convenience, continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. I want to offer my heartfelt thank you to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for the incredible work they do every day to fulfill our mission of serving others. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So it looks like you're guiding to about 60 basis points of operating margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. Why wouldn't it be more than that? Given you're comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a 2-year stack basis, plus you're benefiting from all these margin-enhancing initiatives like DG Fresh, Fast Track, NCI and others. And how -- within that, how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus 2019? \nJohn Garratt: Yes, so I'll tackle both those questions, Michael. This is John. First of all, I'd say we're really pleased with what we did in 2020, expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didn't give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds, the biggest headwind being the SG&A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year. \n We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables, which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns, as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall. \n Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin, again, we feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that, 117 basis points for the year. And to your point, initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out. The 3 biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns, higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. \n But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing, in the near term, higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead in the near term, these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer term, we do feel like we're well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned, the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we've talked about before within gross margin and within SG&A. \n But at the same time, it's noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10% double-digit EPS growers over the long term, we are continuing, as we called out, to reinvest in the business. We mentioned $60 million to $70 million that's hitting SG&A next year. \n And then the other thing I'll mention is in terms of COVID expenses, we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we've captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. That's very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And we're all just trying to figure out what's going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down 16% versus the 34.5% in March of last year, it would imply a high teens 2-year stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year? Have you -- are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens 2-year stack would be kind of a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I can help you there, Michael. I'll start by saying it's bumpy, right? There's a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March, you're extrapolating over a very short period of time, which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here, we called out, yes, as you mentioned, the negative 16% month-to-date from the end of February through March 16 this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year, it was not dissimilar to the 34.5% comp where we ended the period, so fairly representative. But again, there's a fair bit of noise within this so I'd be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully, that helps you understand where we were at this point. \nMichael Lasser: That certainly does. Good luck. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: A couple of questions. I guess, first, on the comps. The 10% to 12% that you mentioned in the release on a 2-year stack, it actually felt like that's a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so -- yet you're still going to have stimulus, at least in the first part of the year, probably now and for a little while longer. And so I guess the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that? Any thoughts around it? Why -- if the 10% to 12%, in our view, is doable, why couldn't the top line end up being a little bit stronger? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again, just dialing the clock back a little bit, we've said historically that this model works really well at a 2% to 4% comp. That's the engine of the 10%-plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a 2-year comp stack of 10% to 12% over 2 years, that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that. And I tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said, the relevance of the brand, the broadening appeal, the new customers we've brought in, the bigger baskets we're enjoying, I'd say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted, the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance. So we feel good about the guidance that we've provided. \n But we did note that -- and it's based on what we know, but what we did note was that we didn't include the impact of stimulus because it's really relatively unknown what impact it will have, to what degree it might help. So that's not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there's just a lot of uncertainty when you think about: one, compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain. \n And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times, what people say and do is 2 different things and so it remains to be seen if that's the case. So we're cautiously optimistic. We didn't build it in. It could be an upside, but it's just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up, and maybe take another shot at something Michael just asked. If you look at the gross margins versus 2019, and John, you mentioned some transportation costs, is there any reason why they shouldn't be higher than 2019? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. Again, I don't want to get into the specifics of guidance around operating margin for this year. We wanted to give -- there's a high degree of uncertainty, we wanted to give some guidance that we gave the top line and the bottom line. I'll just say that we're really pleased with the performance we've been delivering over the last few years, growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over 2 points this year. \n But again, there's a lot of unknown this year, a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned, when you look at this year, that does create some deleverage. And again, we are investing in the business. Now again, that investment piece is accretive, but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates, and then obviously, you do have other inflationary pressures. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Todd or John, maybe on the same-store sales acceleration to the mid -- that we've seen so far, what have you seen from discretionary versus consumables? And then on the double-digit 2-year stack that you forecasted for this year, how much of the acceleration, relative to the past 2 years, do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains? Trying to get a sense for that 2-year stack of double digits relative to mid- to high single digits, the trailing 2 years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. This is Todd. Yes, I would tell you, let me take the second part first. I would tell you that, that comp, we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is, we've seen them continue to come back, so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into '21. We see them still here in '21, which is really good to see. \n And again, with all of our initiatives that we've got put together, I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I'm not going to give you exactly what you're looking for, but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here. \n And then what we've seen so far, just to give you a little bit more color, nonconsumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March, it will become even more meaningful because as you recall, the stock-up trip from last year, with the pandemic, with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable, food, perishable areas really took off last year and nonconsumables were a little soft, quite frankly. And we're seeing the opposite, quite frankly, right now. So that's great to see. \n But what we can also see is that our initiatives around nonconsumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those nonconsumables in them as well. So they're spending at a good rate there, and we believe that she'll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe just to follow up, John, on the SG&A front. Could you just help quantify what you've embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective, just so we can baseline it? And then ex the strategic investments, is there any change to 2.5% to 3%? I think that's roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I'll tackle both of those. First, in terms of the COVID spend, obviously, we're going to do what's necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That's, of course, going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say, we've built in a considerable reduction of that, assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that's what's captured in the guidance. We didn't give a specific number on that, but it is a considerable step down. \n As you think about SG&A and the 2.5% to 3% leverage point, we've kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One, we are investing in SG&A to drive overall operating margin expansion, particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh, as we're taking over self-distribution NCI, you spend a little bit on SG&A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin, so it's very beneficial, overall. But it does throw off the math on that. \n And then there are some other initiatives like POP SHELF and others that are more -- have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we've done is we've really stepped up the remodels, and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out, that's a lot to strip out, that, as well as the COVID expenses, yes, we're still looking at that 2.5% to 3% leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly, our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. \n But that's really the only change to that. But for the next few years, as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh, you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores, for instance, and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That's really the big driver of that. But overall, it's accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: So I apologize upfront about another sales-related question. But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So if we were to basically dollarize your comps, for lack of a better term, it looks like there really wasn't much of a change in your sales run rate, like from a sales per store perspective between March -- February and March. \n So 2 questions: first, is that a fair assumption? And then related to that, assuming you maintain a pretty steady -- are you assuming that you're going to maintain a pretty steady sales per store cadence for the balance of the year? Or are you expecting a deceleration in kind of sales per store during the course of the year as we hopefully enter a more normalized environment? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. That's a good question. I'll start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year, we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we've put in place, like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries. So we've assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. \n But as we've looked at it throughout the year, we've also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now, there is, concurrent with the pandemic, there is a consolidation of trips and we're benefiting from that as well as, again, benefiting from that share of wallet. So as you go through the year, we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as you're competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet. But still very positive on how much we can retain and, again, the fundamentals of the business and the relevance of the brand as people have come in. \n And again, as we said, I don't want to dissect February and March too much because again, it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March. And again, you're extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So when you strip out all the noise, I would tell you that, again, with the guidance we provided, that contemplates what we've seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is, again, stimulus, and we just didn't put anything in for that because we just don't know what that benefit will be and to what degree. \nScot Ciccarelli: But John, just to be clear, like in terms of sales per store, maybe a different way to look at it, did you see much of a change between February and March? \nJohn Garratt: No. I would say, as you strip out some of the noise I mentioned, we think the core business is performing similar and performing very well when you look at those stacks. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Karen Short of Barclays. \nKaren Short: I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar '21? I mean, obviously, you saw a pretty meaningful, I think, deceleration in traffic in February, but that's off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about that just broadly. \n And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about '22 as it relates to gross margins. So the question I have on that is, how should we think about the base level of gross margin for '22? Because it seems like you are at a much more permanently elevated base on the gross margin front. And I know '21 is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts, but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to '22 on the gross margin front. \nTodd Vasos: Thanks for the question, Karen. I'll take the first part and then kick it over to John for the '22 gross margin discussion. So on the traffic side, again, February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that, quite frankly, we -- you saw in the release, 8,500 store hours of lost time. But the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost 2 days, we had anywhere from 20% to 30% of our store base close for that time. So it's a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what's happened in March. \n But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall, where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4. As John said, as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes, I think it's important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out, the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure, we've seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again, I caution, it's still very early to tell what's going to happen here. \n But I think the bigger picture is we're retaining a lot of those customers, as I mentioned earlier, that we got during the pandemic. And we're still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers, so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new nonconsumable type items that we've got in our stores, she still comes to us. So we believe we're seeing that repeat customer. And there's no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. And then to the second part of the question, and I agree with you, there's just a lot of noise in 2021. I think one thing I would point to, as you look at over that 2-year period, lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line, a 2-year CAGR of 15% to 20%, I think, really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future. \n Now I don't want to give specific guidance around 2022. It's premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4 and for the full year, as I mentioned, it's the strategic initiatives which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we're reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin. \n Now the one thing that, we mentioned, [ juiced ] 2020 a little bit was the mix. So that's why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat, which is a bit of a drag. But the thing -- the other items driving that gross margin expansion, we expect to continue. And so that's why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year and would encourage people to look at that 2-year stack and push forward, the same drivers are there, that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term, not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones but really pleased what we've seen with the shrink improvement, the supply chain efficiencies, a lot of opportunities still around private brands, penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management. \n Again, when you look at our scale and our growing scale as a limited SKU shop, it really puts us in a very favorable position to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front, we'll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now and as we've seen for quite a while now, we feel like we're in the best position on pricing we've been in and don't see, at least the foreseeable future, the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin while also driving traffic and sales. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Karen, I would also just say real quick and then get to the next question, is that I feel as good about this business than I have the 12, almost 13 years that I've been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated, I think once we get through the noise of '21, I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen, even prior to COVID, we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there's no reason why that shouldn't continue as we can -- as we go long term. \nKaren Short: No, I complete -- I just want to clarify, on the 8,400 lost days, I get that to be -- it's about 180 basis points to the comp. Is that fair? \nJohn Garratt: Well, I think the way to -- yes, I think the way to look at this is, I think we did quantify the impact of the storm on operating profit, and a meaningful piece of that was the sales impact. So if you look at the overall dollars we quantified, about half of that was sales flow-through. So maybe that's the way to dimensionalize that. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I guess, John, first, starting with guidance. I was curious what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative, I was just curious if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. As you look at the promotional backdrop, we think it remains rational. It's been that way for the last about 1.5 years, so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward, we're not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we're very well positioned on price. And Todd, do you want to add anything? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Rupesh, I would tell you, from a position of strength last year, we've positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than we've been in many, many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing, we are better than we've been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated, the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame, and quite frankly, has been that way for 1.5 years. So we feel pretty good about where we are but always reserve the right if we need to help our consumer out, we'll do that. But right now, we don't see that in the near future. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So Todd, just curious on your latest thoughts on what you're seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us, I mean, it is a fairly strong consumer out there, stimulus is coming. So I just want to get your thoughts there. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you the consumer -- our core consumers always stretch, as you know, but I have to repeat that each time because she really is. And I would tell you that in the last 6 to 8 months, she's felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases, because again, lack of work or not working that full 40-hour shift to that full-time that she was doing in many cases. And our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point. \n In saying that, what we have also seen, though, is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that. So we're in round 3, and as I indicated, it's very early on in that third round. We're bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we're also bullish, when we think about the back half of the year, the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December should also benefit our core consumer. \n And then obviously, the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps. So there is a lot of tailwind. We just, in our guidance, didn't contemplate any of that because, again, it's so -- first of all, it's so new, we just don't know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing, Rupesh, to keep in mind is that we're well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she's outspending it. And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said, there are other -- we're not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get our -- more than our fair share at retail. It's just some of these other areas that are now open, whether it be dining out, whether it be travel, to some degree, that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. \nChandni Luthra: I wanted to talk about these new banners that you spoke of today. And especially with POP SHELF, you mentioned doing a store-within-a-store concept with signage for both POP SHELF and the Dollar General banner outside. As you think about your core customer, what gives you confidence that the customers will not feel an alienation to the core banner with this double signage outside in a store-within-a-store concept? How do you think about that? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, that's a great question. And I would tell you, first of all, our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the POP SHELF consumer. But in the areas that we're looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts, it is a little higher demographic than our core. \n So just to give you some color, in these areas, the demographics are more in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range versus our true Dollar General of $35,000 to $40,000 range, somewhere in there. So it's not quite the POP SHELF, where it's $75,000-plus. But I believe that the crossover, there's enough there to entice the consumer to come in. \n The second piece of it is that we believe that -- and we've already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in POP SHELF and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General without even having any signage up with POP SHELF. So we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation, higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box. It is a test, right? So just keep that in mind. It will be 25 stores this year. But if it works, and we believe it will, there could be some additional ones that we do in '22 and many more as we continue to move forward. \nChandni Luthra: Got it. And my follow-up is around new customer retention strategy that you mentioned during your third quarter call around -- some strategy around basically retaining those new customers. Could you give an update on that as to what you're doing to retain new customers that you gained during this time? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you. Well, we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it because we knew, because of the way we were doing it, this wasn't a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane, we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set. \n So to be able to do that, it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customer's mindset. And so we've been working it hard, now for the better part of 5 months, coming on 6 months. And we believe that we've seen the benefit of that already. When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out, we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store. So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. \n And now even into Q1, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing that core customer -- or I'm sorry, that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more, we're still seeing that customer. We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that we'll continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in. And as John indicated, a large part of that comp this year is predicated on retaining a good portion of those consumers, which, again, we believe we have the right to service that consumer based on what we've seen so far. \nOperator: We're showing time for one final question today. Our last question will be coming from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: You've shared a lot today. I guess maybe I'd be looking for just additional details on where you are on some of your initiatives and what we should be thinking about over the course of the next 12 months. Specifically DG Fresh, would love for you to elaborate there in addition to DG GO! and other ways that you are just overall kind of attacking to keep market share. \nJeffery Owen: Paul, this is Jeff. Thank you for that question, and we are very proud of our accomplishments with DG Fresh. The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that it's providing for us. So to be in 16,000 stores-plus is really an accomplishment. And originally, as we talked about, DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs, improving in-stocks and a broader assortment and we've hit on all 3. So that is performing very well. \n The other thing that we're excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that we've also introduced, the reason we're able to build larger stores with more coolers is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago, and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that. And so when you think about the future and our new format prototype that we're going to be moving to in the mid part of '21, DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer. \n And then as you look to the future, we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over 10,000 stores as we look ahead. So DG Fresh, again, complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing but is going to set us up for the future in a big way. \n On the digital side, I would say, remember, on DG Pickup, 17,000 stores-plus going from pilot to full rollout in less than a year is, again, a tremendous accomplishment of the team. But I will say we continue to make great progress there and expanding the assortment. We've optimized our substitution technology. And one thing you got to keep in mind is we're providing optionality for this customer. But our store itself is an incredibly convenient proposition. And when you combine being 5 miles within 75% of the population and self-checkout that we've got in 1,600 stores right now, the convenience bar continues to rise. But we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far there. \n And then finally, I would tell you, in terms of engagement with the customer, that's the other thing on the digital side she's asking for. And with 4 million active users and growing, we feel real good about what we're doing there as well. So 2 key initiatives that we look to continue to contribute to our future success. \nPaul Trussell: Just lastly, John, I appreciate the CapEx and kind of share buyback guidance. Maybe just talk about your approach to cash kind of priorities overall and how to think about that even beyond 2021. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I'll start by saying our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. And the first priority remains investing in high-return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then it's still continuing to pay a competitive dividend, which we recently increased 16.7%. \n And then it's buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity. But as we've always noted, we want to protect our current investment-grade credit rating, so we keep the leverage ratio around 3. So we bought back this year. I mean, we're able to do all and buy back $2.5 billion of shares with the extra cash. Next year, we're targeting $1.8 billion. And then I think also, meaningfully, what you saw last year is we accelerated virtually every strategic initiative with the extra cash, which is again our first priority, investing in the business. So that served us very well and remains unchanged. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. Thank you for your interest in Dollar General. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2020, and I thank all of our associates for their extraordinary efforts over the past year to support our customers, our communities and each other. Despite a challenging operating environment, our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of Serving Others by providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. And I could not be more proud of their efforts. \n Throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer. In response to the COVID pandemic, we implemented several safety protocols; enhanced our benefits and leave policies; invested in personnel and personnel protective equipment; dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities; and most recently, removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine. In total, we invested approximately $248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020, including about $167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year. \n At Dollar General, we remain committed to being part of the solution and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of U.S. population. At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. \n To that end, we're excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021. First, we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives, including our nonconsumables initiative, Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh. In addition, while still early, we are very pleased with the results of our POP SHELF stores, which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. As a result, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for POP SHELF in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger-format Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept. \n We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy, including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus store, or DGP, and the introduction of 2 new store formats, which we began testing in 2020. Similar to our larger-footprint DGP concept, the first new format has a selling space of approximately 8,500 square feet, which compares to about 7,300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store. Beginning later this year, this new format, along with our DGP concept, will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores, replacing both our traditional and higher cooler count DGTP formats, allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth. \n Our second new format is even larger with approximately 9,500 square selling feet and will be deployed opportunistically across new store, relocation and remodel opportunities. Notably, on average, our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store, which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead. \n Finally, we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the continental United States, which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. \n But first, let's recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're pleased that for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories. \n From a multi-cadence perspective, comp sales in December increased in the high single-digit range, with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January. In total, fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%. These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they are spending more with us compared to last year. \n Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019. These new customers continue to skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. \n We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers, and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. We're particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to fourth quarter diluted EPS of $2.62, an increase of 24.8% over the prior year. For the full year, net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, including net sales growth of 28.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories. Comp sales for the year increased 16.3%, representing our 31st consecutive year of same-store sales growth. \n In 2020, we celebrated the opening of our 17,000th store and the launch of our newest store concept, POP SHELF. In total, we completed a record 2,780 real estate projects during the year, exceeding our initial target of 2,580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth. \n From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in other key areas, including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. Collectively, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. \n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. \n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences, we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. \n Overall, I am proud of our associates and all that we've achieved over the past year. We feel very good about the underlying business and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Yes. This is Todd. Yes, I would tell you, let me take the second part first. I would tell you that, that comp, we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is, we've seen them continue to come back, so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into '21. We see them still here in '21, which is really good to see. \n And again, with all of our initiatives that we've got put together, I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I'm not going to give you exactly what you're looking for, but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here. \n And then what we've seen so far, just to give you a little bit more color, nonconsumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March, it will become even more meaningful because as you recall, the stock-up trip from last year, with the pandemic, with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable, food, perishable areas really took off last year and nonconsumables were a little soft, quite frankly. And we're seeing the opposite, quite frankly, right now. So that's great to see. \n But what we can also see is that our initiatives around nonconsumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those nonconsumables in them as well. So they're spending at a good rate there, and we believe that she'll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year. Thanks for the question, Karen. I'll take the first part and then kick it over to John for the '22 gross margin discussion. So on the traffic side, again, February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that, quite frankly, we -- you saw in the release, 8,500 store hours of lost time. But the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost 2 days, we had anywhere from 20% to 30% of our store base close for that time. So it's a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what's happened in March. \n But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall, where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4. As John said, as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes, I think it's important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out, the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure, we've seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again, I caution, it's still very early to tell what's going to happen here. \n But I think the bigger picture is we're retaining a lot of those customers, as I mentioned earlier, that we got during the pandemic. And we're still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers, so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new nonconsumable type items that we've got in our stores, she still comes to us. So we believe we're seeing that repeat customer. And there's no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John? Yes. Karen, I would also just say real quick and then get to the next question, is that I feel as good about this business than I have the 12, almost 13 years that I've been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated, I think once we get through the noise of '21, I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen, even prior to COVID, we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there's no reason why that shouldn't continue as we can -- as we go long term. Yes, Rupesh, I would tell you, from a position of strength last year, we've positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than we've been in many, many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing, we are better than we've been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated, the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame, and quite frankly, has been that way for 1.5 years. So we feel pretty good about where we are but always reserve the right if we need to help our consumer out, we'll do that. But right now, we don't see that in the near future. Yes. I would tell you the consumer -- our core consumers always stretch, as you know, but I have to repeat that each time because she really is. And I would tell you that in the last 6 to 8 months, she's felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases, because again, lack of work or not working that full 40-hour shift to that full-time that she was doing in many cases. And our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point. \n In saying that, what we have also seen, though, is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that. So we're in round 3, and as I indicated, it's very early on in that third round. We're bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we're also bullish, when we think about the back half of the year, the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December should also benefit our core consumer. \n And then obviously, the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps. So there is a lot of tailwind. We just, in our guidance, didn't contemplate any of that because, again, it's so -- first of all, it's so new, we just don't know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing, Rupesh, to keep in mind is that we're well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she's outspending it. And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said, there are other -- we're not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get our -- more than our fair share at retail. It's just some of these other areas that are now open, whether it be dining out, whether it be travel, to some degree, that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money. Yes, that's a great question. And I would tell you, first of all, our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the POP SHELF consumer. But in the areas that we're looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts, it is a little higher demographic than our core. \n So just to give you some color, in these areas, the demographics are more in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range versus our true Dollar General of $35,000 to $40,000 range, somewhere in there. So it's not quite the POP SHELF, where it's $75,000-plus. But I believe that the crossover, there's enough there to entice the consumer to come in. \n The second piece of it is that we believe that -- and we've already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in POP SHELF and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General without even having any signage up with POP SHELF. So we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation, higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box. It is a test, right? So just keep that in mind. It will be 25 stores this year. But if it works, and we believe it will, there could be some additional ones that we do in '22 and many more as we continue to move forward. Yes. Thank you. Well, we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it because we knew, because of the way we were doing it, this wasn't a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane, we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set. \n So to be able to do that, it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customer's mindset. And so we've been working it hard, now for the better part of 5 months, coming on 6 months. And we believe that we've seen the benefit of that already. When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out, we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store. So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. \n And now even into Q1, as I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing that core customer -- or I'm sorry, that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more, we're still seeing that customer. We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that we'll continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in. And as John indicated, a large part of that comp this year is predicated on retaining a good portion of those consumers, which, again, we believe we have the right to service that consumer based on what we've seen so far."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. \n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points, which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to: a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. \n These factors were partially offset by: increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million. As a percent of sales, operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year. \n Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 24.8% to $2.62, which contributed to full year EPS of $10.62, an increase of 59.9%. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 12.2% overall and 6.3% on a per-store basis. While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels. \n In 2020, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion or 73.2%. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $87 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.4 billion under the repurchase program. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. \n Moving to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can, based on what we currently know. That said, there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year, which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear, including, but not limited to: the recently approved government stimulus package, other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis, including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates. \n With this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021: net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat; a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6% but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20%, or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%. \n Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns, as outlined in today's press release, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.42 per share, which represents an increase of 16.7%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Finally, as noted in today's press release, our outlook for 2021 real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q3 earnings release on December 3, 2020. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. Despite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a 2-year stack basis. From the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%. \n Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year. That said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1. \n Turning to gross margin. In 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin nonconsumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate. However, the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain. \n Gross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive nonconsumable categories. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020, which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year. \n In addition, while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses, including further expansion of our private fleet, are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021. Also, please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020. \n In terms of SG&A, while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to last year. However, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. \n With regard to our strategic initiatives, in aggregate, we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. \n Finally, we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February. \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Yes, so I'll tackle both those questions, Michael. This is John. First of all, I'd say we're really pleased with what we did in 2020, expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didn't give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds, the biggest headwind being the SG&A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year. \n We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables, which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns, as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall. \n Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin, again, we feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that, 117 basis points for the year. And to your point, initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out. The 3 biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns, higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. \n But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing, in the near term, higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead in the near term, these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer term, we do feel like we're well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned, the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we've talked about before within gross margin and within SG&A. \n But at the same time, it's noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10% double-digit EPS growers over the long term, we are continuing, as we called out, to reinvest in the business. We mentioned $60 million to $70 million that's hitting SG&A next year. \n And then the other thing I'll mention is in terms of COVID expenses, we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we've captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers. Yes. I can help you there, Michael. I'll start by saying it's bumpy, right? There's a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March, you're extrapolating over a very short period of time, which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here, we called out, yes, as you mentioned, the negative 16% month-to-date from the end of February through March 16 this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year, it was not dissimilar to the 34.5% comp where we ended the period, so fairly representative. But again, there's a fair bit of noise within this so I'd be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully, that helps you understand where we were at this point. Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again, just dialing the clock back a little bit, we've said historically that this model works really well at a 2% to 4% comp. That's the engine of the 10%-plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a 2-year comp stack of 10% to 12% over 2 years, that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that. And I tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said, the relevance of the brand, the broadening appeal, the new customers we've brought in, the bigger baskets we're enjoying, I'd say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted, the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance. So we feel good about the guidance that we've provided. \n But we did note that -- and it's based on what we know, but what we did note was that we didn't include the impact of stimulus because it's really relatively unknown what impact it will have, to what degree it might help. So that's not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there's just a lot of uncertainty when you think about: one, compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain. \n And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times, what people say and do is 2 different things and so it remains to be seen if that's the case. So we're cautiously optimistic. We didn't build it in. It could be an upside, but it's just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree. Yes. Again, I don't want to get into the specifics of guidance around operating margin for this year. We wanted to give -- there's a high degree of uncertainty, we wanted to give some guidance that we gave the top line and the bottom line. I'll just say that we're really pleased with the performance we've been delivering over the last few years, growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over 2 points this year. \n But again, there's a lot of unknown this year, a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned, when you look at this year, that does create some deleverage. And again, we are investing in the business. Now again, that investment piece is accretive, but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates, and then obviously, you do have other inflationary pressures. Yes. I'll tackle both of those. First, in terms of the COVID spend, obviously, we're going to do what's necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That's, of course, going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say, we've built in a considerable reduction of that, assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that's what's captured in the guidance. We didn't give a specific number on that, but it is a considerable step down. \n As you think about SG&A and the 2.5% to 3% leverage point, we've kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One, we are investing in SG&A to drive overall operating margin expansion, particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh, as we're taking over self-distribution NCI, you spend a little bit on SG&A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin, so it's very beneficial, overall. But it does throw off the math on that. \n And then there are some other initiatives like POP SHELF and others that are more -- have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we've done is we've really stepped up the remodels, and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out, that's a lot to strip out, that, as well as the COVID expenses, yes, we're still looking at that 2.5% to 3% leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly, our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. \n But that's really the only change to that. But for the next few years, as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh, you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores, for instance, and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That's really the big driver of that. But overall, it's accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective. Yes. That's a good question. I'll start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year, we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we've put in place, like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries. So we've assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. \n But as we've looked at it throughout the year, we've also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now, there is, concurrent with the pandemic, there is a consolidation of trips and we're benefiting from that as well as, again, benefiting from that share of wallet. So as you go through the year, we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as you're competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet. But still very positive on how much we can retain and, again, the fundamentals of the business and the relevance of the brand as people have come in. \n And again, as we said, I don't want to dissect February and March too much because again, it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March. And again, you're extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So when you strip out all the noise, I would tell you that, again, with the guidance we provided, that contemplates what we've seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is, again, stimulus, and we just didn't put anything in for that because we just don't know what that benefit will be and to what degree. No. I would say, as you strip out some of the noise I mentioned, we think the core business is performing similar and performing very well when you look at those stacks. Yes. And then to the second part of the question, and I agree with you, there's just a lot of noise in 2021. I think one thing I would point to, as you look at over that 2-year period, lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line, a 2-year CAGR of 15% to 20%, I think, really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future. \n Now I don't want to give specific guidance around 2022. It's premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4 and for the full year, as I mentioned, it's the strategic initiatives which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we're reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin. \n Now the one thing that, we mentioned, [ juiced ] 2020 a little bit was the mix. So that's why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat, which is a bit of a drag. But the thing -- the other items driving that gross margin expansion, we expect to continue. And so that's why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year and would encourage people to look at that 2-year stack and push forward, the same drivers are there, that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term, not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones but really pleased what we've seen with the shrink improvement, the supply chain efficiencies, a lot of opportunities still around private brands, penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management. \n Again, when you look at our scale and our growing scale as a limited SKU shop, it really puts us in a very favorable position to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front, we'll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now and as we've seen for quite a while now, we feel like we're in the best position on pricing we've been in and don't see, at least the foreseeable future, the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin while also driving traffic and sales. Well, I think the way to -- yes, I think the way to look at this is, I think we did quantify the impact of the storm on operating profit, and a meaningful piece of that was the sales impact. So if you look at the overall dollars we quantified, about half of that was sales flow-through. So maybe that's the way to dimensionalize that. Yes. As you look at the promotional backdrop, we think it remains rational. It's been that way for the last about 1.5 years, so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward, we're not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we're very well positioned on price. And Todd, do you want to add anything? Yes. I'll start by saying our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. And the first priority remains investing in high-return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then it's still continuing to pay a competitive dividend, which we recently increased 16.7%. \n And then it's buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity. But as we've always noted, we want to protect our current investment-grade credit rating, so we keep the leverage ratio around 3. So we bought back this year. I mean, we're able to do all and buy back $2.5 billion of shares with the extra cash. Next year, we're targeting $1.8 billion. And then I think also, meaningfully, what you saw last year is we accelerated virtually every strategic initiative with the extra cash, which is again our first priority, investing in the business. So that served us very well and remains unchanged."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities, including our strategic initiatives and plans for 2021. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a fantastic job in 2020, executing against our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts as we look to further build on our progress in 2021.\n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 5,800 stores at the end of 2020, including nearly 400 stores in our light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,600 stores at year-end. \n Given our strong performance to date, we plan to expand this offering to about 5,700 additional stores this year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than 11,000 by year-end. This total includes over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach. \n Moving to our newest concept, POP SHELF, which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with about 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. We opened our first 5 locations in 2020. And as Todd mentioned, given our strong results to date, we plan to accelerate the rollout of POP SHELF in 2021. In fact, we are now targeting to have a total of up to 50 POP SHELF stores opened by year-end compared to our previous goal of about 30 total locations. \n In addition to these stores, we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021. \n In terms of our store-within-a-store concept, a smaller footprint POP SHELF shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store, and we will display both Dollar General and POP SHELF branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness. From these initial stores, our goal is to test, learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with POP SHELF by making it more available to a broader range of customers. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. Given our success to date, we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products, including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment while increasing our relevance with customers. \n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 16,000 stores from 10 facilities at the end of 2020. This compares to our previous expectation of over 14,000 stores at year-end. Overall, we remain well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021. \n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During 2020, we added more than 62,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2021 as we continue to build on our multiyear track record for growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n As a reminder, in 2019, we began incorporating high-capacity coolers into the majority of our new, remodeled and relocated stores, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. \n Next, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient customer package pickup and dropoff service is now available in over 8,500 stores, with plans to be in a total of over 9,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. \n With regards to our supply chain, our plans for 2021 include further expansion of our private fleet, which accounted for more than 20% of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020. Reducing stem miles is also an important contributor to these efforts, and the recent opening of our Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead. \n We also plan to open 2 additional DG Fresh facilities in 2021 as we look to further optimize our fresh network and support future growth. In addition, we anticipate our combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska will be completed in late 2022,  which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles over time. \n Finally, while we are very pleased with our progress in 2020, shrink reduction remains an important area of opportunity. We continue to build on our success with electronic article surveillance by increasing the number of items tagged while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2020, we completed a total of 2,780 real estate projects, including 1,000 new stores, 1,670 remodels and 110 relocations. Additionally, we now have produce in more than 1,100 stores. For 2021, we expect to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also plan to add produce in approximately 700 stores, bringing the total number of stores that carry produce to more than 1,800. \n In addition, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to advance the evolution of our store base with plans to build on the success of our DGP format, including the introduction of 2 new format types. With about 8,500 square feet of selling space, both our first new format and DGP concept allow for expanded higher capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores. In total, we expect more than 550 of our overall real estate projects this year to be in one of these format types as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America. \n The second new format consists of about 9,500 square feet of selling space. In addition to an extended queue line and broader assortment, this larger layout also includes nearly 50 high-capacity coolers and expanded produce offering, fresh meat and additional checkout lanes, including a self-checkout bullpen with multiple stations. We believe this even larger format better positions us to meet the growing needs of our customers, particularly in highly underserved markets, and we are targeting more than 100 locations by year-end. \n Overall, these larger formats allow us to incorporate our best and most impactful initiatives and are designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format all while continuing to drive strong returns. \n Moving to an update on the number of new store opportunities. Through a combination of our growing relevance with customers, format innovation, an evolving retail landscape and leveraging new technologies, we estimate there are now approximately 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities in the continental U.S. which are available for a Dollar General store. This compares to our prior estimate of nearly 12,000 opportunities and is inclusive of our 2021 new unit pipeline. \n Although these opportunities are available to all small-box retailers, as a leader in small-box retail, combined with our proven track record of new unit development and format innovation, we believe we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share as we move ahead. And while we continue to evaluate, we are currently -- we currently estimate POP SHELF could add approximately 3,000 additional store opportunities in the Continental U.S., with about another 1,000 additional opportunities available for our smaller footprint DGX format. \n When taken together, we estimate there are a total of approximately 17,000 new store opportunities available across our format types, which we believe represents a long runway for new unit growth. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience. Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. \n We made significant progress in 2020, highlighted by the accelerated rollout of DG Pickup, our Buy Online Pick Up In-store offering to more than 17,000 stores, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience. During the year, we also saw continued growth in customer engagement across our digital ecosystem, including our digital coupon offering, shopping list feature, cart calculator shopping and budgeting tool, e-commerce site, DG GO! mobile checkout and our mobile app, which ended the year with nearly 4 million monthly active users. \n Looking ahead, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement and loyalty. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. \n We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 1,600 stores at the end of 2020, with plans for an aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we expect to introduce this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. And for those associates already on our team, this growth is resulting in numerous opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as POP SHELF. \n In addition, we transitioned to a virtual learning environment in 2020, resulting in the continued development of our people, including nearly 3 million training hours for our employees, all supported by our award-winning training and development programs. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. We have a robust set of initiatives in place for 2021 and are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. \n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance and our 2020 results, which further demonstrate our unique combination of value and convenience, continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. I want to offer my heartfelt thank you to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for the incredible work they do every day to fulfill our mission of serving others. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Paul, this is Jeff. Thank you for that question, and we are very proud of our accomplishments with DG Fresh. The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that it's providing for us. So to be in 16,000 stores-plus is really an accomplishment. And originally, as we talked about, DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs, improving in-stocks and a broader assortment and we've hit on all 3. So that is performing very well. \n The other thing that we're excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that we've also introduced, the reason we're able to build larger stores with more coolers is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago, and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that. And so when you think about the future and our new format prototype that we're going to be moving to in the mid part of '21, DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer. \n And then as you look to the future, we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over 10,000 stores as we look ahead. So DG Fresh, again, complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing but is going to set us up for the future in a big way. \n On the digital side, I would say, remember, on DG Pickup, 17,000 stores-plus going from pilot to full rollout in less than a year is, again, a tremendous accomplishment of the team. But I will say we continue to make great progress there and expanding the assortment. We've optimized our substitution technology. And one thing you got to keep in mind is we're providing optionality for this customer. But our store itself is an incredibly convenient proposition. And when you combine being 5 miles within 75% of the population and self-checkout that we've got in 1,600 stores right now, the convenience bar continues to rise. But we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far there. \n And then finally, I would tell you, in terms of engagement with the customer, that's the other thing on the digital side she's asking for. And with 4 million active users and growing, we feel real good about what we're doing there as well. So 2 key initiatives that we look to continue to contribute to our future success."

[Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their tireless work over the past several months in helping our customers and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite continued significant uncertainty in the operating environment, our team members have been unwavering in their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient and close-to-home access to everyday essentials, at a time when our customers need them most. I could not be more proud of their efforts. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customer continues to be our top priority.  \n We continue to closely monitor CDC and other governmental guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are evaluating and adapting our safety protocols as that guidance evolves.  \n As one of America's essential retailers, we remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times. And we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our expansive network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population.  \n At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.  \n To that end, and from a position of strength, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we plan to further accelerate our pace of new store openings and remodels in 2021. In total, we expect to execute 2,900 real estate projects next year as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. \n As previously announced, we recently introduced our newest store concept, POP SHELF, further building on our proven track record of store format innovation. We opened our first 2 locations during the quarter, and while still early, we are encouraged by their initial results.  \n Finally, one of our core values is representing and respecting the dignity and differences of others. Building on this core value, along with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we recently updated our fourth operating priority to better capture and express our intent. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the results for the third quarter.  \n The quarter was once again highlighted by exceptional growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're particularly pleased that, for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our nonconsumable business, which speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.\n From a multicadence perspective, comp sales for Q3 periods range from the low double digits to mid-teens, with the best performance in August, followed by modest moderation as we move through the quarter. Overall, third quarter net sales increased 17.3% to $8.2 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 12.2%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers continue to consolidate shopping trips in an effort to limit social contact. Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales, as measured by syndicated data, driven by double-digit increases in both units and dollars.  \n Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q3 of 2019. These new customers skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, further underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are also encouraged by the repurchase rates of new customers and are working hard to retain them with more targeted marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.\n We're particularly pleased with the -- in how we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to third quarter diluted EPS of $2.31, an increase of 63% over the prior year. Collectively, our Q3 results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate the current environment and emerge even stronger than before.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a meaningful increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19.  \n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3% in the third quarter, an increase of 178 basis points and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.9%, a decrease of 62 basis points. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales this quarter include: occupancy costs, utilities, retail labor, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and employee benefits. These items were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 57.3% to $773 million compared to $491 million in the third quarter of 2019. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.4%, an increase of 240 basis points. Operating profit in the third quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales.  \n The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $25 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees.  \n Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have invested approximately $153 million in COVID-19 related expenses, including about $99 million in appreciation bonuses for our frontline employees.  \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and compares to 21.7% in the third quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the third quarter increased 62.7% to $2.31.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times, while continuing to invest for the long term. We finished the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $760 million compared to Q2, and an increase of $1.9 billion over the prior year. Merchandise inventories were $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 11.8% overall and 5.9% on a per-store basis. While out-of-stocks remain higher than normal for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels.  \n Year-to-date through Q3, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.4 billion, an increase of 103.7%.\n Total capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $698 million and included our planned investments in remodels and relocations, new stores and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock for $902 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $88 million. \n At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.6 billion.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020, we continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time and are unlikely to resume issuing guidance to the extent such uncertainties persist.  \n With regards to share repurchases, capital spending and real estate projects, our outlook for the year remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 27, 2020.\n Let me now provide some context as to what we expect in the fourth quarter. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q4. From the end of Q3 through December 1, comp sales accelerated, increasing approximately 14% during this time frame, reflecting increased demand in our consumables business. And while we remain cautious in our sales outlook, we are encouraged with our sales trends, particularly as we move farther past government stimulus payments and the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits under the CARES Act. That said, significant uncertainty still exists concerning the duration of the positive sales environment, including external factors related to the ongoing health crisis and their potential impact on our business.  \n Beyond these macro factors, there are a number of more specific considerations as it relates to the fourth quarter. First, we anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effect of higher transportation costs due to a tight carrier market, as a result of driver shortages and a greater demand for services at third party carriers. In addition, we are in the process of building, expanding or opening a number of distribution centers across our Dry and DG Fresh networks. And while we expect these investments will enable us to drive even greater efficiencies going forward and further support future growth, these investments will pressure gross margin rates in Q4. Also, please keep in mind that the fourth quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross margin perspective, following 60 basis points of rate improvement in Q4 2019. \n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to operating margin over time as the benefit to gross margin continues to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh on pace to be accretive to operating margin in 2020.\n However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the fourth quarter, as we further accelerate their rollouts.  \n Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the fourth quarter as a result of COVID-19, including up to $75 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which includes our recent announcement to award approximately $50 million in additional bonuses, bringing our full year investment and appreciation bonuses to approximately $173 million as well as continued investments in health and safety measures.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, resulting in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team once again did a fantastic job in Q3, executing against the portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts.  \n Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first 3 quarters, we added approximately 49,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection.  \n Turning now to private brands, which remain a priority as we look to drive overall category awareness and even greater customer adoption through rebranding, repositioning and expansion of select brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines. We're very pleased with the continued progress across these fronts, including the successful rebranding of 6 product lines and the introduction of 2 new brands so far this year, and we're excited about the continued momentum we're seeing across the portfolio.  \n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. During the quarter, we completed our initial rollout of this convenient customer package pickup and drop off service, which is now available in more than 8,500 stores. We're very pleased with the reception this offering is receiving from our customers, and we continue to explore innovative opportunities to further leverage our unique real estate footprint to provide even more solutions for our customers in convenient and nearby locations.  \n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key area of focus for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us.  The team, once again, did a great job during the quarter, working with our supply partners to ensure product availability.  \n Looking ahead, we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while further diversifying our countries of origin. We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies, including the continued expansion of our private fleet, the opening of additional DG Fresh facilities and the recent purchase of our future Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center, which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles beginning early next year.\n In addition, we recently began construction on our first ever ground up combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska. We anticipate this facility will be completed in early 2022, enabling us to drive even greater efficiencies as we move ahead.\n The team is also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink, as we continue to build on our success with Electronic Article Surveillance. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business.  \n As previously announced, we recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 17,000th store. This is a testament to the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team, as we continue to expand our footprint and enhance our ability to serve even more customers.  \n As a reminder, our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well for many years in evaluating new real estate opportunities. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average  returns,  cannibalization and the payback period. Of note, we continue to see strong performance across these metrics.  \n For 2020, we remained on track to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores. Through the first 3 quarters, we opened 780 new stores, remodeled 1,425 stores, including more than 1,000 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats  and we relocated 76 stores. We also added produce in more than 140 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 1,000. \n As Todd noted, for fiscal 2021, we plan to execute 2,900 real estate projects in total, including 1,050 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 100 store relocations. Additionally, we plan to add produce in approximately 600 stores. Notably, we expect approximately 50% of our new unit openings and about 75% of our remodels to be in the DGTP or DGP format. The remainder of our new store openings and remodels will primarily be in the traditional format with higher capacity coolers. \n Our plans also include having approximately 30 stores in our new POP SHELF concept, which Todd will discuss in more detail by the end of fiscal 2021, up from 2 locations today. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains extremely robust, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n We continue to build on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail later. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand as evidenced by our recent customer survey results, where we continue to see overall satisfaction scores at all-time highs.  \n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. We have 3 business operating priorities but at the heart of them is our foundational fourth operating priority. This priority is anchored in our people, and is truly foundational to everything we do at Dollar General. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\n As Todd noted, this updated language more fully expresses our values and core beliefs and more closely aligns with the investments we continue to make in the development of our people. Importantly, we believe these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline.  \n As a growing retailer, we also continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes,  and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.  \n We also so recently completed our annual community giving campaign where employees across the organization come together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. I was once again humbled by the generosity and compassion of our people. This event truly embodies the serving others culture that is so deeply embedded at Dollar General.\n  In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Jeff. I'm proud of the great progress the team has made in advancing our strategic initiatives. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories.  \n The NCI offering was available in 5,200 stores at the end of Q3. And given our strong execution to date, we now expect to expand the offering to more than 5,600 stores by the end of 2020, including approximately 400 stores in our NCI Light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,400 stores at year-end.  \n We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores, once again, delivered in the quarter. We also continue to benefit from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, and we are pleased with the performance of our light stores, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.  \n As noted earlier, we are also excited about the recent introduction of  POP SHELF and the opening of our first 2 locations, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through: first, continually refreshed merchandise, primarily in targeted nonconsumable product categories; second, a differentiated in-store experience, including impactful displays of our offering, designed to create a highly visual, fun and easy shopping experience; and third, exceptional value with approximately 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. Importantly, while POP SHELF delivers many of Dollar General's core strengths, including customer insights, merchandise innovation, operational excellence, digital capabilities and real estate expertise, it is specifically tailored to a different shopping occasion, will primarily be located in suburban communities and initially targets a higher-income customer, potentially unlocking additional and incremental growth opportunities going forward. \n We're proud of all of the incredible work the team has done in standing up this concept. And with the initial work now behind us, we look forward to welcoming additional customers to POP SHELF as we moved forward our goal of approximately 30 stores by the end of 2021. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs in our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. Importantly, we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We're pleased with the success we are already seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we plan and continue to believe DG Fresh could provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to even more stores in the future. \n In total, we were self-distributing to more than 13,000 stores from 8 DG fresh facilities at the end of Q3. We expect to capture benefits from this initiative in more than 14,000 stores from 10 facilities by the end of this year and are well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.\n Next, our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. \n In an environment where customers continue to seek safe, familiar and convenient experiences, we believe our unique footprint, combined with our digital assets, provides a distinct competitive advantage. \n More specifically, I'm pleased to note that during the quarter, we expanded DG Pickup, our buy online, pickup in the store offering to nearly 17,000 stores compared to more than 2,500 stores at the end of Q2, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include further expansion of DG GO! checkout, as we look to make this feature available in select stores that include self-checkout, further enhancing our convenience proposition. \n By leading our channel in digital tools and experiences, we believe we are well positioned to drive more in-store traffic, grow basket size and offer even greater convenience to new and existing customers.  \n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals, including increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates.  \n During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of self-checkout to more than 900 stores compared to approximately 400 stores at the end of Q2, with plans for further expansion as we move forward. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including our customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback from both customers and employees.  \n Overall, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, while taking actions, including the continued execution of our key initiatives to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  \n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, and continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly changing retail landscape.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's performance and our results through the first 3 quarters of 2020, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with our customers and positions us well going forward. As we are in the midst of a busy and extended holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And congrats on another nice quarter. Todd, so clearly, the company is hitting on all cylinders today. What do you think DG takes from this pandemic following a vaccine? Meaning any categories that you believe the company is taking multiyear market share. What are you seeing from new customer acquisition? Just kind of thinking about the after versus, obviously, the clear momentum that you're seeing today? \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Matt. That's a great question because I here at Dollar General, we're always focused on that long term, right? And we believe that through the initiatives that we have in place, including DG Fresh, including our digital assets and Fast Track, including our cooler initiatives that we continue to benefit from and feel that we are still in the early innings of the ballgame on, we feel that those will serve us very well post pandemic. And let's hope that post pandemic comes sooner than later. But as we continue to look forward, we also are encouraged on some of the early initiatives we have around POP SHELF and that concept. Because we believe that there's a fair amount of white space out there for a discretionary format, like POP SHELF. \n And again, I think we're encouraged as we look at the first 2 stores on what that customer response has been. On the customer acquisition side of the equation, we're very pleased with the amount of new customers that we've seen. And what really encourages us is that, that's a little different customer, one that is very adjacent to our core customer, but as I said, skews a little younger, more digital savvy and a little bit more ethnically diverse. And that really gives us the opportunity to speak to her a little differently. And I'm happy to say that, toward the end of Q3, we actually launched our new customer acquisition platform through social media and a few other means that we won't talk about exactly, we don't want to give away too much. But suffice it to say, we're happy with some of the early response that we've even seen from that. So more to come. We're doing everything that we believe is appropriate right now while we're in the midst of the pandemic to retain and keep those customers as we move into 2021. \nMatthew Boss: Great, and then a follow-up maybe for John. On gross margins, if I look at expansion in the last 2 quarters, you've shown 150 basis points plus relative to multi-year second and third quarter historical level. So maybe could you just elaborate on the fourth quarter factors that you mentioned and is the point that we should expect moderation in growth margin expansion? Or do you actually see these headwinds outpacing the tailwind? \nJohn Garratt: Great question, Matt. First, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the gross margin expansion we've seen with 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year expansion. As you mentioned, 178 this quarter. \n I'll  maybe start by talking about the drivers this quarter and that can help inform as we look ahead. I think it's important to note that the initiatives, like DG Fresh and NCI, are really contributing and impactful to the 3 biggest drivers we saw this quarter. \n First, lower markdowns. With the strong sell through on nonconsumables, we didn't have to take as much clearance markdowns as well as, as we've been talking about for a number of quarters now, we're just -- continue to be more and more targeted on promotional activity and have less promotional activity necessary. \n Secondly, when you look at higher initial markups, that was primarily driven by DG Fresh. We continue to see that same substantial cost takeout and that only grows as we scale. \n And then third, the mix benefit. Again, the key driver there was nonconsumables. Obviously, there's been a shift in wallet, but I would say that we really positioned ourselves very well with what we've done to that part of the box with the impact of NCI and spreading the learnings from that, as evidenced by the 10 consecutive quarters of noncon comps. \n In addition to that, we did have lower shrink, which we were pleased to see as a percent of sales. Now partly offsetting that was higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead, as you alluded to in Q4, we are not providing specific guidance given the uncertainty of the environment. But I think factors to consider, as you look ahead, consider first that we expect -- anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4 to continue with the tight carrier market and the DC startups. Also, Q2 and Q3, it certainly was enhanced by the mix shift into nonconsumables, which it's hard to say but -- when, but it's likely to moderate somewhat over time from those heightened levels. And then I think, in Q4, it's also important to note that it is the most challenging lap of the year, as we mentioned, as we're lapping 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4. \n So while there are some uncertainties and some near-term headwinds, we continue to believe there's opportunities to increase our gross margin and operating margin over time. We continue to see a growing benefit from initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, as I mentioned. And those will only grow as they scale. We continue to see opportunities in the levers that we talk about: category management, private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. And while we always reserve the right to invest in price where needed, where appropriate, we're currently in a great spot on price and don't see the need to make any investments there right now. So believe we're making the right investments and have the levers to continue to improve gross margins and operating margins over the long term. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: And congratulations from me as well. Thinking -- and I hate to focus on 2021, but I think that's what everyone is kind of concerned about as it relates to the tough compares.  And -- so I wanted to ask a couple of questions. I appreciate there's a lot of unknowns. But is there any way to kind of provide a framework with respect to puts and takes? And I would ask that in the context of while I understand you definitely can't predict sales, how are you thinking about freight into 2021 year-over-year?\n And then how are you thinking about wages specifically? Because you outlined, I guess, $173 million in bonuses, but you also probably will have around $53 million in COVID expenses. But once you've offered these bonuses, how do you think about taking them away? Maybe a little color on both of those would be great. \nTodd Vasos: Karen, let me start, and then I'll have John chime in as well here. As we look out to 2021, again, we're really squarely focused on is controlling what we can control. And that is really in our key initiatives, ensuring that we execute at a high level, retain as many of these new customers as we possibly can through the means that we have talked about and also, again, with our key initiatives being a nice backdrop to that new consumer.  She can do a much fuller shop inside of our store than she ever has been able to do in the past. \n As you start to think about 2021 and the labor side, to your point, wages, again, we don't have a crystal ball, so we don't know exactly what the pandemic is going to look like in the first part of the year, or how fast this vaccine will be given.  We've got some hints, obviously, from the CDC and through the government. But the one thing I think just to take away is that, we are going to do what's right by our employees first, right? And so we'll continue to watch that. We'll continue to keep them safe through this pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. And if we do need to pay additional bonuses to reward our frontline workers for taking care of the customers, then we'll do that. But again, I think it's too early to tell in Q1 exactly what's going to happen at this point. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that, as you mentioned, it's challenging in this uncertain environment, given the fluid nature of the pandemic and the impact that can have on the economy and the consumer to say what sales look like. But to Todd's point, what we're focused on is controlling what we can control, and that's accelerating virtually all our strategic initiatives, which we feel great about and are really pleased with what we're seeing them contribute to the top line and the bottom line. And again, those will continue to have an increased impact as we scale those. And so we're focused on that as well as, as Todd alluded to, doing whatever we can to take care of those customers, those new customers trading in, to keep them coming back as they've indicated they intend to and also keeping those baskets gets bigger. And I think what we've done to make the box more relevant than ever providing that fuller fill in trip positions us well. So focused on controlling what we can control. \n In terms of puts and takes, we feel great about, I'll tell you, the fundamentals of the business, the strength of the business model, the initiatives and having a model that performs well in all cycles of the economy. In terms of a couple of specific things you mentioned. You mentioned freight, and it remains to be seen. I think a big part of freight is the capacity constraint right now and the heightened volume. So it remains to be seen. That's something that -- this is the time of the year with the holiday seasons, it's usually at its peak. And certainly, all the volume is straining that now. Hopefully, that is something that would normalize over time. And certainly, we have a lot of mitigating efforts to go after that in terms of further scaling our private fleet, continuing to expand and diversify our carrier base and then ongoing efforts around stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.\n And then the other thing I pointed to in Q4 around gross margin is, we have, over the last 2 quarters, gotten additional benefit from that mix shift into nonconsumables. We feel fantastic about the nonconsumables business as we continue to scale NCI, as we continue to import the best ideas from that to the rest of the chain. So we feel great about that piece of the business, but it remains to be seen if you can continue to get that kind of mix shift and would imagine that, that would, over time, moderate somewhat. And so I think that's just some of the considerations for next year, but I feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. \nKaren Short: Okay. If I could just ask one more. Is there any pattern or anything you could point to on performance of rural versus urban stores? And then -- in the quarter, but then also with the acceleration that you saw into the quarter-to-date? Any pattern to point out there other than consumables accelerating in 4Q? \nJeffery Owen: Karen, this is Jeff. In terms of the rural versus urban, the nice thing about our model is consistency really across the store base. But specifically to rural, we did see our rural stores perform well and outperformed our urban stores. So we're pleased with that performance and continue to be real pleased with our remodel program, our new store development program and the fact that we're within 75 -- 75% of the U.S. population is within 5 miles of our store network. So that unique footprint continues to serve us well.\n You mentioned about the trends in terms of the sales piece. We did mention, as John said earlier in our prepared remarks around the sales. And so we're pleased, we're ready for the fourth quarter. I can tell you that in terms of the team's ability to set holiday. We've made great improvements in our in-stock position and the inventory side. So we are certainly ready to serve that customer and excited about the remaining parts of the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: A little bit along the lines of Karen's question, maybe unanswerable around 2021. I want to ask through the lens of the top line. And in the past, you've been fairly deliberate around some of your sales drivers, like bottoms-up, new store remodels, sales initiatives. I think we talked about a recession uplift. And all of this is on top of, I think, normally, some inflation. Are you still thinking about '21 in this way? Can you share your thoughts on any of these items? And then I don't know how you think about stimulus, if that's part of a sales plan or not for next year? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Simeon, as we look at the sales number for '21, again, way early. We're not giving any guidance here yet by any means. But I would tell you that a lot of the long-term algorithms are still well intact. Our new store algorithm is still very strong. As you saw, we're going to be opening more stores next year at the same and accelerated pace. And I think that should show you that we're very, very pleased with our store performance -- our new store performance. And quite frankly, our remodel program accelerating next year is also a great sign that we're seeing tremendous value, and our consumers are seeing tremendous value coming out of those remodels. \n So all of the fundamentals around the top line, including our initiative drivers, are well intact. Stimulus, we'll have to wait and see. We don't want to guess what may or may not come. But any stimulus that does come would be a tailwind for us, and I'm sure many retailers. But we'll watch and see what happens there. We're not betting on that right now until we see it. What we are big on here, and I'll keep saying it, is controlling what we can control, and that is driving that top line through our long-term strategic initiatives.\n And I think they have served us well over the many years and are set up to serve us well for many years to come. \nSimeon Gutman: My follow-up, it's related to margin. The second call out in the release, the initial higher markups. I think we presume that's the DG Fresh. And Todd, I think in your prepared comments, you said it's building, and that's my question. I wanted to ask if you could talk about the rate of, I guess, sequential momentum there because, I think, it was initially called out in last year's fourth quarter. And so trying to think about how that ramps into '21, is it ratably, or is there some step change that we should expect from that item alone next year? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I think the way to think about that is -- and you're exactly right that, that is the primary driver of that initial markup benefit that we've been talking about for a number of quarters now. It's already accretive to the business. And to your point, it will grow over time, not only literally as you add more stores, but you have economies of scale as you serve more stores from existing DCs, as you get the efficiencies of operating that -- the team, it's been amazing how quickly we've gotten this up and running and gotten quite efficient at this. So you get both benefits. So it continues to grow as it scales, both in terms of the gross margin benefit, that substantial cost take out. But then the other thing we've talked about is, is the sales benefit. We are already seeing in those stores served by our self-distribution, better in-stocks, better sales, and that's -- we expect that to grow -- that benefit to grow. And then the other thing is now we're free to improve the assortment.\n We had agreements before, which precluded us from carrying certain competing brands in private label. This opened that up, and as we mentioned, we're already adding new SKUs there. And then longer term, it unlock -- we see the opportunity to unlock further expansion of produce to more stores. And so we think it's the gift that keeps on giving, both in terms of cost and margin, but also in terms of sales. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So Dollar General reported a 17.5% comp year-to-date. If you had to guess or maybe put some analysis behind it, how much of that 17.5% is due to market share gains? And then how much is due to other factors like wallet share gains? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. We're not going to probably, Michael, get into too much of that due to competitive reasons, obviously. But I would tell you that we're really happy with the share gains that we've seen. Those share gains are -- continue to come from a multitude of different disciplines that are out there. Drug continues to be the largest share donor that we've seen. But some new emerging trends that we've seen and have some evidence of is that in the discretionary areas, we're taking some share at a rapid rate as well. And in many cases, that's probably from some of the consolidation that has happened on that side of the equation recently. And so couple that with our initiatives around NCI and now POP SHELF, I believe we're well positioned as we move into '21 to capitalize and keep those customers that we're seeing there in the share gains that we've already gotten in 2020. \nMichael Lasser: Got it. And then my follow-up question is around your expectations, your initial thoughts on as there is a slower environment for consumable retail, presumably the promotional environment is going to increase. And would you use price and all the good margin expansion potential that you have and reinvest that back in price to gain a disproportionate amount of market share in a softer consumer -- consumable environment overall? \nTodd Vasos: Well, we always say we always reserve the right to lower price to ensure that we keep those footsteps coming into Dollar General, and more importantly, service that consumer. As we sit right now, though, Michael, we don't see any evidence and/or need to pull a price lever. The promotional activity, the everyday price activity across retail right now seems to be pretty tame and about the same as it has been for many quarters now. But as we continue to watch the environment, we'll do whatever we have to do to ensure that we're priced right. But I think it's also important to note, in the 12 years that I've been here, this is the best competitive positioning we've ever been in on price, the very best. \n So from a position of strength, we've already lowered price, got it where it needs to be and is in -- and are in very good shape as we move into 2021. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk about some of the new customers that you've acquired earlier in the year. And if there are any retention metrics that you might have that you can share? And then second, just going back to your comments about lower markdowns. Just curious if that was true across both consumables and nonconsumables? And if you could talk about the gross margins within each of those businesses relative to themselves a year ago? \nJeffery Owen: Sure. This is Jeff. First, on the new customer retention metrics you asked about, as Todd earlier stated, we're really pleased with the launch of our retention strategy that we did at the tail end of Q3. So first, I got to tell you, it's a little early, but one of the things here at Dollar General that we do very well is, we measure everything, and we are very focused on monitoring our efforts so that we can pivot if we need to or we can accelerate if we need to.\n And so what I can tell you is, is that initially, we're pleased with what we're seeing from the new customer retention strategy that we put in place. We think it's the right time to do that. When you think about that, not only from when we started acquiring new customers, call it, 6 months or so ago, and then also thinking about that as it relates to 2021 and our desire to try to retain as many as we can. So very pleased with the surgical digital approach that we're taking. Rest assured, we are measuring that. And I think, at a future your date, we'll be able to talk more about that. But right now, it's a little bit early. And then I'll toss it to John on the margin question. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. On the markdowns, it really is both. We've been talking about lower markdowns as a percent of sales for a number of quarters. And the driver of that has been lower promotional activity. The team has gotten very targeted and got very sophisticated in the tools we've put in place and the processes to really go after what gives us the biggest bang for the buck, what really moves the needle on true incrementality of traffic and profitability. And so that's been throughout. But with the strength -- growing strength of nonconsumables and the better sell-through there, we have then, more recently, seen a reduction in the amount of clearance activity required to clear those goods. So it really is both consumables and nonconsumables. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I want to go back to the launch of the POP SHELF concept. I am just curious in terms of the decision to launch the new concept right now during the pandemic, is that driven by maybe more real estate opportunities, or just any more color you can provide there? \nTodd Vasos: Sure. As you can imagine, any concept of this magnitude, the work had begun long before COVID, the pandemic, or any of that. Probably, as you really dial the clock back about 18 months or so ago, really started that process. And I would tell you that the plan all along was to launch about this time that we launched it. So we were very much right on track to our initial launch times. \n Now, obviously, we didn't anticipate the pandemic that -- what we didn't anticipate either was the abundance of available real estate that would be out there. And that's been a real positive for us with some of the consolidation that we've seen from discretionary retailers that may no longer be in business at this point. We've seen some real opportunity to grab some very good real estate that we're able to open up this concept in. And that's why we're pretty bullish on the 30 by the end of 2021, both from a real estate perspective, but also the initial sales of this concept, at least in the first 2 stores, has been very, very strong and exceeding our expectations. \n So again, hitting on all cylinders on the initiative so far, but again, it's early. But rest assured, we are -- we'll do what we do best here at Dollar General, and that's executed at a high level and continue to refine this new concept to make it the best it can be. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. Maybe just one follow-up question. Any thoughts you can share in terms of what you guys are seeing thus far in the holiday season and how it's performing versus expectations? And I know your quarter-to-date trends accelerated, if you're to be driven by the consumables category. I was just curious if you think that the November -- almost the November performance was -- represented any pull forward of demand? \nTodd Vasos: Sure. I think it's a little early to talk about what Q4 is going to look like in totality, a lot of selling left, month of December for retail, obviously, is very big. I don't have to mention that, but I will. But when you start to look at our numbers, the great thing that we saw was, our traffic numbers in November started to rebound pretty nicely, really came back to where we saw some of those traffic numbers in Q2. And so that was a great sign for us that the consumer was out shopping, not only the consumable side of the business, but the nonconsumable or discretionary side of that equation as well.\n The other thing, and Jeff alluded to it in part of his comments earlier, we really leaned in on inventory for Q4 around holiday. We knew it was going to be a good holiday season for Dollar General. We went in, bought more inventory from the closeout market mainly, and we are in some of our best inventory positions in holiday that we've been in, in many years and are very encouraged by the early sell-through of what we've seen in holiday. \n So encouraged, but a lot of selling left to go. \nOperator: Thank you. And thank you to everyone who's joined us today. This will conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their tireless work over the past several months in helping our customers and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite continued significant uncertainty in the operating environment, our team members have been unwavering in their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient and close-to-home access to everyday essentials, at a time when our customers need them most. I could not be more proud of their efforts. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customer continues to be our top priority.  \n We continue to closely monitor CDC and other governmental guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are evaluating and adapting our safety protocols as that guidance evolves.  \n As one of America's essential retailers, we remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times. And we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our expansive network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population.  \n At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.  \n To that end, and from a position of strength, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we plan to further accelerate our pace of new store openings and remodels in 2021. In total, we expect to execute 2,900 real estate projects next year as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. \n As previously announced, we recently introduced our newest store concept, POP SHELF, further building on our proven track record of store format innovation. We opened our first 2 locations during the quarter, and while still early, we are encouraged by their initial results.  \n Finally, one of our core values is representing and respecting the dignity and differences of others. Building on this core value, along with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we recently updated our fourth operating priority to better capture and express our intent. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the results for the third quarter.  \n The quarter was once again highlighted by exceptional growth on both the top and bottom lines. We're particularly pleased that, for the quarter, our 3 nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note, this represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our nonconsumable business, which speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.\n From a multicadence perspective, comp sales for Q3 periods range from the low double digits to mid-teens, with the best performance in August, followed by modest moderation as we move through the quarter. Overall, third quarter net sales increased 17.3% to $8.2 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 12.2%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers continue to consolidate shopping trips in an effort to limit social contact. Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales, as measured by syndicated data, driven by double-digit increases in both units and dollars.  \n Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q3 of 2019. These new customers skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, further underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are also encouraged by the repurchase rates of new customers and are working hard to retain them with more targeted marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.\n We're particularly pleased with the -- in how we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to third quarter diluted EPS of $2.31, an increase of 63% over the prior year. Collectively, our Q3 results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate the current environment and emerge even stronger than before.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Thank you, Jeff. I'm proud of the great progress the team has made in advancing our strategic initiatives. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories.  \n The NCI offering was available in 5,200 stores at the end of Q3. And given our strong execution to date, we now expect to expand the offering to more than 5,600 stores by the end of 2020, including approximately 400 stores in our NCI Light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,400 stores at year-end.  \n We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores, once again, delivered in the quarter. We also continue to benefit from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, and we are pleased with the performance of our light stores, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.  \n As noted earlier, we are also excited about the recent introduction of  POP SHELF and the opening of our first 2 locations, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. POP SHELF aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience, delivered through: first, continually refreshed merchandise, primarily in targeted nonconsumable product categories; second, a differentiated in-store experience, including impactful displays of our offering, designed to create a highly visual, fun and easy shopping experience; and third, exceptional value with approximately 95% of our items priced at $5 or less. Importantly, while POP SHELF delivers many of Dollar General's core strengths, including customer insights, merchandise innovation, operational excellence, digital capabilities and real estate expertise, it is specifically tailored to a different shopping occasion, will primarily be located in suburban communities and initially targets a higher-income customer, potentially unlocking additional and incremental growth opportunities going forward. \n We're proud of all of the incredible work the team has done in standing up this concept. And with the initial work now behind us, we look forward to welcoming additional customers to POP SHELF as we moved forward our goal of approximately 30 stores by the end of 2021. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs in our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. Importantly, we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We're pleased with the success we are already seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we plan and continue to believe DG Fresh could provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to even more stores in the future. \n In total, we were self-distributing to more than 13,000 stores from 8 DG fresh facilities at the end of Q3. We expect to capture benefits from this initiative in more than 14,000 stores from 10 facilities by the end of this year and are well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.\n Next, our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. \n In an environment where customers continue to seek safe, familiar and convenient experiences, we believe our unique footprint, combined with our digital assets, provides a distinct competitive advantage. \n More specifically, I'm pleased to note that during the quarter, we expanded DG Pickup, our buy online, pickup in the store offering to nearly 17,000 stores compared to more than 2,500 stores at the end of Q2, providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include further expansion of DG GO! checkout, as we look to make this feature available in select stores that include self-checkout, further enhancing our convenience proposition. \n By leading our channel in digital tools and experiences, we believe we are well positioned to drive more in-store traffic, grow basket size and offer even greater convenience to new and existing customers.  \n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals, including increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates.  \n During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of self-checkout to more than 900 stores compared to approximately 400 stores at the end of Q2, with plans for further expansion as we move forward. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including our customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback from both customers and employees.  \n Overall, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, while taking actions, including the continued execution of our key initiatives to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.  \n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, and continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly changing retail landscape.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's performance and our results through the first 3 quarters of 2020, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with our customers and positions us well going forward. As we are in the midst of a busy and extended holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Thank you, Matt. That's a great question because I here at Dollar General, we're always focused on that long term, right? And we believe that through the initiatives that we have in place, including DG Fresh, including our digital assets and Fast Track, including our cooler initiatives that we continue to benefit from and feel that we are still in the early innings of the ballgame on, we feel that those will serve us very well post pandemic. And let's hope that post pandemic comes sooner than later. But as we continue to look forward, we also are encouraged on some of the early initiatives we have around POP SHELF and that concept. Because we believe that there's a fair amount of white space out there for a discretionary format, like POP SHELF. \n And again, I think we're encouraged as we look at the first 2 stores on what that customer response has been. On the customer acquisition side of the equation, we're very pleased with the amount of new customers that we've seen. And what really encourages us is that, that's a little different customer, one that is very adjacent to our core customer, but as I said, skews a little younger, more digital savvy and a little bit more ethnically diverse. And that really gives us the opportunity to speak to her a little differently. And I'm happy to say that, toward the end of Q3, we actually launched our new customer acquisition platform through social media and a few other means that we won't talk about exactly, we don't want to give away too much. But suffice it to say, we're happy with some of the early response that we've even seen from that. So more to come. We're doing everything that we believe is appropriate right now while we're in the midst of the pandemic to retain and keep those customers as we move into 2021. Karen, let me start, and then I'll have John chime in as well here. As we look out to 2021, again, we're really squarely focused on is controlling what we can control. And that is really in our key initiatives, ensuring that we execute at a high level, retain as many of these new customers as we possibly can through the means that we have talked about and also, again, with our key initiatives being a nice backdrop to that new consumer.  She can do a much fuller shop inside of our store than she ever has been able to do in the past. \n As you start to think about 2021 and the labor side, to your point, wages, again, we don't have a crystal ball, so we don't know exactly what the pandemic is going to look like in the first part of the year, or how fast this vaccine will be given.  We've got some hints, obviously, from the CDC and through the government. But the one thing I think just to take away is that, we are going to do what's right by our employees first, right? And so we'll continue to watch that. We'll continue to keep them safe through this pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. And if we do need to pay additional bonuses to reward our frontline workers for taking care of the customers, then we'll do that. But again, I think it's too early to tell in Q1 exactly what's going to happen at this point. Yes, Simeon, as we look at the sales number for '21, again, way early. We're not giving any guidance here yet by any means. But I would tell you that a lot of the long-term algorithms are still well intact. Our new store algorithm is still very strong. As you saw, we're going to be opening more stores next year at the same and accelerated pace. And I think that should show you that we're very, very pleased with our store performance -- our new store performance. And quite frankly, our remodel program accelerating next year is also a great sign that we're seeing tremendous value, and our consumers are seeing tremendous value coming out of those remodels. \n So all of the fundamentals around the top line, including our initiative drivers, are well intact. Stimulus, we'll have to wait and see. We don't want to guess what may or may not come. But any stimulus that does come would be a tailwind for us, and I'm sure many retailers. But we'll watch and see what happens there. We're not betting on that right now until we see it. What we are big on here, and I'll keep saying it, is controlling what we can control, and that is driving that top line through our long-term strategic initiatives.\n And I think they have served us well over the many years and are set up to serve us well for many years to come. Yes. I think the way to think about that is -- and you're exactly right that, that is the primary driver of that initial markup benefit that we've been talking about for a number of quarters now. It's already accretive to the business. And to your point, it will grow over time, not only literally as you add more stores, but you have economies of scale as you serve more stores from existing DCs, as you get the efficiencies of operating that -- the team, it's been amazing how quickly we've gotten this up and running and gotten quite efficient at this. So you get both benefits. So it continues to grow as it scales, both in terms of the gross margin benefit, that substantial cost take out. But then the other thing we've talked about is, is the sales benefit. We are already seeing in those stores served by our self-distribution, better in-stocks, better sales, and that's -- we expect that to grow -- that benefit to grow. And then the other thing is now we're free to improve the assortment.\n We had agreements before, which precluded us from carrying certain competing brands in private label. This opened that up, and as we mentioned, we're already adding new SKUs there. And then longer term, it unlock -- we see the opportunity to unlock further expansion of produce to more stores. And so we think it's the gift that keeps on giving, both in terms of cost and margin, but also in terms of sales. Yes. We're not going to probably, Michael, get into too much of that due to competitive reasons, obviously. But I would tell you that we're really happy with the share gains that we've seen. Those share gains are -- continue to come from a multitude of different disciplines that are out there. Drug continues to be the largest share donor that we've seen. But some new emerging trends that we've seen and have some evidence of is that in the discretionary areas, we're taking some share at a rapid rate as well. And in many cases, that's probably from some of the consolidation that has happened on that side of the equation recently. And so couple that with our initiatives around NCI and now POP SHELF, I believe we're well positioned as we move into '21 to capitalize and keep those customers that we're seeing there in the share gains that we've already gotten in 2020. Well, we always say we always reserve the right to lower price to ensure that we keep those footsteps coming into Dollar General, and more importantly, service that consumer. As we sit right now, though, Michael, we don't see any evidence and/or need to pull a price lever. The promotional activity, the everyday price activity across retail right now seems to be pretty tame and about the same as it has been for many quarters now. But as we continue to watch the environment, we'll do whatever we have to do to ensure that we're priced right. But I think it's also important to note, in the 12 years that I've been here, this is the best competitive positioning we've ever been in on price, the very best. \n So from a position of strength, we've already lowered price, got it where it needs to be and is in -- and are in very good shape as we move into 2021. Sure. As you can imagine, any concept of this magnitude, the work had begun long before COVID, the pandemic, or any of that. Probably, as you really dial the clock back about 18 months or so ago, really started that process. And I would tell you that the plan all along was to launch about this time that we launched it. So we were very much right on track to our initial launch times. \n Now, obviously, we didn't anticipate the pandemic that -- what we didn't anticipate either was the abundance of available real estate that would be out there. And that's been a real positive for us with some of the consolidation that we've seen from discretionary retailers that may no longer be in business at this point. We've seen some real opportunity to grab some very good real estate that we're able to open up this concept in. And that's why we're pretty bullish on the 30 by the end of 2021, both from a real estate perspective, but also the initial sales of this concept, at least in the first 2 stores, has been very, very strong and exceeding our expectations. \n So again, hitting on all cylinders on the initiative so far, but again, it's early. But rest assured, we are -- we'll do what we do best here at Dollar General, and that's executed at a high level and continue to refine this new concept to make it the best it can be. Sure. I think it's a little early to talk about what Q4 is going to look like in totality, a lot of selling left, month of December for retail, obviously, is very big. I don't have to mention that, but I will. But when you start to look at our numbers, the great thing that we saw was, our traffic numbers in November started to rebound pretty nicely, really came back to where we saw some of those traffic numbers in Q2. And so that was a great sign for us that the consumer was out shopping, not only the consumable side of the business, but the nonconsumable or discretionary side of that equation as well.\n The other thing, and Jeff alluded to it in part of his comments earlier, we really leaned in on inventory for Q4 around holiday. We knew it was going to be a good holiday season for Dollar General. We went in, bought more inventory from the closeout market mainly, and we are in some of our best inventory positions in holiday that we've been in, in many years and are very encouraged by the early sell-through of what we've seen in holiday. \n So encouraged, but a lot of selling left to go."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a meaningful increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19.  \n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3% in the third quarter, an increase of 178 basis points and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.9%, a decrease of 62 basis points. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales this quarter include: occupancy costs, utilities, retail labor, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and employee benefits. These items were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 57.3% to $773 million compared to $491 million in the third quarter of 2019. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.4%, an increase of 240 basis points. Operating profit in the third quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales.  \n The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $25 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees.  \n Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have invested approximately $153 million in COVID-19 related expenses, including about $99 million in appreciation bonuses for our frontline employees.  \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and compares to 21.7% in the third quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the third quarter increased 62.7% to $2.31.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times, while continuing to invest for the long term. We finished the quarter with $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $760 million compared to Q2, and an increase of $1.9 billion over the prior year. Merchandise inventories were $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 11.8% overall and 5.9% on a per-store basis. While out-of-stocks remain higher than normal for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels.  \n Year-to-date through Q3, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.4 billion, an increase of 103.7%.\n Total capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $698 million and included our planned investments in remodels and relocations, new stores and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock for $902 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $88 million. \n At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.6 billion.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020, we continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time and are unlikely to resume issuing guidance to the extent such uncertainties persist.  \n With regards to share repurchases, capital spending and real estate projects, our outlook for the year remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 27, 2020.\n Let me now provide some context as to what we expect in the fourth quarter. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q4. From the end of Q3 through December 1, comp sales accelerated, increasing approximately 14% during this time frame, reflecting increased demand in our consumables business. And while we remain cautious in our sales outlook, we are encouraged with our sales trends, particularly as we move farther past government stimulus payments and the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits under the CARES Act. That said, significant uncertainty still exists concerning the duration of the positive sales environment, including external factors related to the ongoing health crisis and their potential impact on our business.  \n Beyond these macro factors, there are a number of more specific considerations as it relates to the fourth quarter. First, we anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effect of higher transportation costs due to a tight carrier market, as a result of driver shortages and a greater demand for services at third party carriers. In addition, we are in the process of building, expanding or opening a number of distribution centers across our Dry and DG Fresh networks. And while we expect these investments will enable us to drive even greater efficiencies going forward and further support future growth, these investments will pressure gross margin rates in Q4. Also, please keep in mind that the fourth quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross margin perspective, following 60 basis points of rate improvement in Q4 2019. \n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to operating margin over time as the benefit to gross margin continues to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh on pace to be accretive to operating margin in 2020.\n However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the fourth quarter, as we further accelerate their rollouts.  \n Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the fourth quarter as a result of COVID-19, including up to $75 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which includes our recent announcement to award approximately $50 million in additional bonuses, bringing our full year investment and appreciation bonuses to approximately $173 million as well as continued investments in health and safety measures.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, resulting in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Great question, Matt. First, I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the gross margin expansion we've seen with 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year expansion. As you mentioned, 178 this quarter. \n I'll  maybe start by talking about the drivers this quarter and that can help inform as we look ahead. I think it's important to note that the initiatives, like DG Fresh and NCI, are really contributing and impactful to the 3 biggest drivers we saw this quarter. \n First, lower markdowns. With the strong sell through on nonconsumables, we didn't have to take as much clearance markdowns as well as, as we've been talking about for a number of quarters now, we're just -- continue to be more and more targeted on promotional activity and have less promotional activity necessary. \n Secondly, when you look at higher initial markups, that was primarily driven by DG Fresh. We continue to see that same substantial cost takeout and that only grows as we scale. \n And then third, the mix benefit. Again, the key driver there was nonconsumables. Obviously, there's been a shift in wallet, but I would say that we really positioned ourselves very well with what we've done to that part of the box with the impact of NCI and spreading the learnings from that, as evidenced by the 10 consecutive quarters of noncon comps. \n In addition to that, we did have lower shrink, which we were pleased to see as a percent of sales. Now partly offsetting that was higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead, as you alluded to in Q4, we are not providing specific guidance given the uncertainty of the environment. But I think factors to consider, as you look ahead, consider first that we expect -- anticipate higher transportation and distribution costs in Q4 to continue with the tight carrier market and the DC startups. Also, Q2 and Q3, it certainly was enhanced by the mix shift into nonconsumables, which it's hard to say but -- when, but it's likely to moderate somewhat over time from those heightened levels. And then I think, in Q4, it's also important to note that it is the most challenging lap of the year, as we mentioned, as we're lapping 60 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4. \n So while there are some uncertainties and some near-term headwinds, we continue to believe there's opportunities to increase our gross margin and operating margin over time. We continue to see a growing benefit from initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, as I mentioned. And those will only grow as they scale. We continue to see opportunities in the levers that we talk about: category management, private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. And while we always reserve the right to invest in price where needed, where appropriate, we're currently in a great spot on price and don't see the need to make any investments there right now. So believe we're making the right investments and have the levers to continue to improve gross margins and operating margins over the long term. Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that, as you mentioned, it's challenging in this uncertain environment, given the fluid nature of the pandemic and the impact that can have on the economy and the consumer to say what sales look like. But to Todd's point, what we're focused on is controlling what we can control, and that's accelerating virtually all our strategic initiatives, which we feel great about and are really pleased with what we're seeing them contribute to the top line and the bottom line. And again, those will continue to have an increased impact as we scale those. And so we're focused on that as well as, as Todd alluded to, doing whatever we can to take care of those customers, those new customers trading in, to keep them coming back as they've indicated they intend to and also keeping those baskets gets bigger. And I think what we've done to make the box more relevant than ever providing that fuller fill in trip positions us well. So focused on controlling what we can control. \n In terms of puts and takes, we feel great about, I'll tell you, the fundamentals of the business, the strength of the business model, the initiatives and having a model that performs well in all cycles of the economy. In terms of a couple of specific things you mentioned. You mentioned freight, and it remains to be seen. I think a big part of freight is the capacity constraint right now and the heightened volume. So it remains to be seen. That's something that -- this is the time of the year with the holiday seasons, it's usually at its peak. And certainly, all the volume is straining that now. Hopefully, that is something that would normalize over time. And certainly, we have a lot of mitigating efforts to go after that in terms of further scaling our private fleet, continuing to expand and diversify our carrier base and then ongoing efforts around stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.\n And then the other thing I pointed to in Q4 around gross margin is, we have, over the last 2 quarters, gotten additional benefit from that mix shift into nonconsumables. We feel fantastic about the nonconsumables business as we continue to scale NCI, as we continue to import the best ideas from that to the rest of the chain. So we feel great about that piece of the business, but it remains to be seen if you can continue to get that kind of mix shift and would imagine that, that would, over time, moderate somewhat. And so I think that's just some of the considerations for next year, but I feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. Yes. On the markdowns, it really is both. We've been talking about lower markdowns as a percent of sales for a number of quarters. And the driver of that has been lower promotional activity. The team has gotten very targeted and got very sophisticated in the tools we've put in place and the processes to really go after what gives us the biggest bang for the buck, what really moves the needle on true incrementality of traffic and profitability. And so that's been throughout. But with the strength -- growing strength of nonconsumables and the better sell-through there, we have then, more recently, seen a reduction in the amount of clearance activity required to clear those goods. So it really is both consumables and nonconsumables."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team once again did a fantastic job in Q3, executing against the portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts.  \n Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first 3 quarters, we added approximately 49,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection.  \n Turning now to private brands, which remain a priority as we look to drive overall category awareness and even greater customer adoption through rebranding, repositioning and expansion of select brands, as well as the introduction of new product lines. We're very pleased with the continued progress across these fronts, including the successful rebranding of 6 product lines and the introduction of 2 new brands so far this year, and we're excited about the continued momentum we're seeing across the portfolio.  \n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. During the quarter, we completed our initial rollout of this convenient customer package pickup and drop off service, which is now available in more than 8,500 stores. We're very pleased with the reception this offering is receiving from our customers, and we continue to explore innovative opportunities to further leverage our unique real estate footprint to provide even more solutions for our customers in convenient and nearby locations.  \n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key area of focus for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us.  The team, once again, did a great job during the quarter, working with our supply partners to ensure product availability.  \n Looking ahead, we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while further diversifying our countries of origin. We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies, including the continued expansion of our private fleet, the opening of additional DG Fresh facilities and the recent purchase of our future Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center, which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles beginning early next year.\n In addition, we recently began construction on our first ever ground up combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska. We anticipate this facility will be completed in early 2022, enabling us to drive even greater efficiencies as we move ahead.\n The team is also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink, as we continue to build on our success with Electronic Article Surveillance. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business.  \n As previously announced, we recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 17,000th store. This is a testament to the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team, as we continue to expand our footprint and enhance our ability to serve even more customers.  \n As a reminder, our real estate model continues to focus on 5 metrics that have served us well for many years in evaluating new real estate opportunities. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average  returns,  cannibalization and the payback period. Of note, we continue to see strong performance across these metrics.  \n For 2020, we remained on track to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores. Through the first 3 quarters, we opened 780 new stores, remodeled 1,425 stores, including more than 1,000 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats  and we relocated 76 stores. We also added produce in more than 140 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 1,000. \n As Todd noted, for fiscal 2021, we plan to execute 2,900 real estate projects in total, including 1,050 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 100 store relocations. Additionally, we plan to add produce in approximately 600 stores. Notably, we expect approximately 50% of our new unit openings and about 75% of our remodels to be in the DGTP or DGP format. The remainder of our new store openings and remodels will primarily be in the traditional format with higher capacity coolers. \n Our plans also include having approximately 30 stores in our new POP SHELF concept, which Todd will discuss in more detail by the end of fiscal 2021, up from 2 locations today. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains extremely robust, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n We continue to build on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail later. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand as evidenced by our recent customer survey results, where we continue to see overall satisfaction scores at all-time highs.  \n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. We have 3 business operating priorities but at the heart of them is our foundational fourth operating priority. This priority is anchored in our people, and is truly foundational to everything we do at Dollar General. Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\n As Todd noted, this updated language more fully expresses our values and core beliefs and more closely aligns with the investments we continue to make in the development of our people. Importantly, we believe these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline.  \n As a growing retailer, we also continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes,  and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.  \n We also so recently completed our annual community giving campaign where employees across the organization come together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. I was once again humbled by the generosity and compassion of our people. This event truly embodies the serving others culture that is so deeply embedded at Dollar General.\n  In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Karen, this is Jeff. In terms of the rural versus urban, the nice thing about our model is consistency really across the store base. But specifically to rural, we did see our rural stores perform well and outperformed our urban stores. So we're pleased with that performance and continue to be real pleased with our remodel program, our new store development program and the fact that we're within 75 -- 75% of the U.S. population is within 5 miles of our store network. So that unique footprint continues to serve us well.\n You mentioned about the trends in terms of the sales piece. We did mention, as John said earlier in our prepared remarks around the sales. And so we're pleased, we're ready for the fourth quarter. I can tell you that in terms of the team's ability to set holiday. We've made great improvements in our in-stock position and the inventory side. So we are certainly ready to serve that customer and excited about the remaining parts of the fourth quarter. Sure. This is Jeff. First, on the new customer retention metrics you asked about, as Todd earlier stated, we're really pleased with the launch of our retention strategy that we did at the tail end of Q3. So first, I got to tell you, it's a little early, but one of the things here at Dollar General that we do very well is, we measure everything, and we are very focused on monitoring our efforts so that we can pivot if we need to or we can accelerate if we need to.\n And so what I can tell you is, is that initially, we're pleased with what we're seeing from the new customer retention strategy that we put in place. We think it's the right time to do that. When you think about that, not only from when we started acquiring new customers, call it, 6 months or so ago, and then also thinking about that as it relates to 2021 and our desire to try to retain as many as we can. So very pleased with the surgical digital approach that we're taking. Rest assured, we are measuring that. And I think, at a future your date, we'll be able to talk more about that. But right now, it's a little bit early. And then I'll toss it to John on the margin question."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, August 27, 2020. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of this call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. \n Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, you may begin your conference. \nDonny Lau: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their exceptional work over the past several months as we continue to navigate this challenging and dynamic operating environment. Throughout this period, our team has remained steadfast in its focus on employee and customer safety, while providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. I could not be more proud of our team's efforts to serve our customers, our communities and each other. \n For over 80 years, Dollar General has served our customers through a unique combination of value and convenience. But it has never been more evident just how essential our role is as our customers depend on us now more than ever for their everyday household needs. We remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our expansive network of nearly [ 17,000 ] within 5 miles or more than 75% of the U.S. population, our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in and out access, our broad assortment of everyday household essentials -- essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low price, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and most importantly, our talented and committed associates. \n Let me now highlight some of the actions we've taken to further protect our employees and customers while keeping our operations running with minimal disruption. As we discussed on last quarter's call, with the onset of COVID-19, we quickly and proactively implemented numerous safety protocols across the company based on recommendations by federal state and local government agencies. We continue to monitor CDC and other government guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are adapting our protocols and policies as that guideline evolves. \n As announced in today's release, we invested approximately $13 million in employee appreciation bonuses during the quarter, bringing our total incremental investment and appreciation bonuses to about $73 million through the end of Q2. Additionally, we expect to invest up to $50 million in additional financial incentives in the second half of the year. Overall, these actions have helped to further ensure the continuity of our business at a time when our customers need us most, while recognizing our employees for their extraordinary efforts. \n While navigating the challenging times of COVID-19, our country has simultaneously entered a period of deep reflection on its societal values, including racial equality and other matters of social justice. Our mission at Dollar General is serving others and our core values include respecting the dignity and differences of others. We are committed to ensuring these values are evident in all we do, including working to promote racial equality and social justice across our communities. \n To further advance these efforts, we recently expanded our diversity and inclusion team and announced the combined $5 million pledge with the Dollar General Literacy Foundation to support racial and social justice and education. Additionally, during the quarter, we published our most recent Serving Others report, which highlights many of our efforts on the ESG front. We first published this report in 2019 and expect that it will evolve and expand as we move into the future. \n Beyond these efforts, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General for continued long-term growth. To that end, and from a position of strength, we are pleased to announce the acceleration of several value-creating initiatives, including DG Pickup, DG Fresh and our nonconsumable initiatives. We are also increasing our expectation for remodels and relocations in 2020. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. \n Turning now to our second quarter performance. The quarter was once again highlighted by extraordinary growth on both the top and bottom lines as some of the consumer trends we experienced in Q1 related to the pandemic continued in Q2. More specifically, and as we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable business in the month of April and through May 26. These trends continued through the end of Q2, and we're pleased to note that for the second quarter, our 3 nonconsumable product categories in total delivered a combined comp sales percentage increase well in excess of our consumable businesses.\n In terms of our monthly comp cadence, sales increased 21.5% in May, 17.9% in June and 17.2% in July. While we do not typically disclose monthly comp sales, we believe it's helpful in this environment. Overall, second quarter net sales increased 24.4% to $8.7 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 18.8%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, particularly -- partially, excuse me, offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers consolidated trips in an effort to limit social contact.  \n During the quarter, our highly consumable market share trends, as measured by syndicated data, continued to exhibit strength, including strong double-digit increases in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending July 25, 2020. Importantly, our data suggests another meaningful increase in new customers this quarter compared to Q2 2019, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are very focused on retaining these new customers and the incremental spend of current customers through the acceleration of several key initiatives, which I noted earlier. We're particularly pleased that we once again delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to second quarter diluted EPS of $3.12, an increase of 89% over the prior year. Collectively, we view these results as further validation that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balance and sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.  \n We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with the plans and initiatives we have in place, we believe we are well positioned to serve an even broader set of consumers, even in a challenging economic environment.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. In addition, please note that Q2 2019 adjusted results exclude a $31 million pretax impact related to significant legal expenses recorded in the quarter, as discussed in today's earnings release.  \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 167 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.4%, a decrease of 205 basis points or 161 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted SG&A. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales in the quarter include retail labor, occupancy costs, utilities, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation and charitable giving expenses. As I mentioned, we also recorded expenses of $31 million in Q2 2019, reflecting  estimate the settlement of certain legal matters.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 80.5% or 71.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 12%, an increase of 373 basis points or 329 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. Operating profit in the second quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $13 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the second quarter was $3.12, which represents an increase of 89% or 79% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers' employees during these challenging times while continuing to invest for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, essentially flat overall and down 6% on a per-store basis. Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion or 157%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance combined with lower levels of inventory as our supply chain teams continue to work closely with our vendor partners to improve in-stock levels for high demand products. Total capital expenditures through the first half were $424 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  \n Moving on to liquidity and capital structure. We continue to have ample liquidity as a result of the measures we took earlier in the year to further bolster our liquidity position, coupled with our extremely strong cash flow in the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. As one of the measures to preserve liquidity at the onset of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended share repurchases during Q1. We continue to evaluate business conditions and our liquidity, and as a result of this evaluation, we resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for $602 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $90 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.5 billion under the repurchase program.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. We continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time. With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business.  \n As Todd noted earlier, we are increasing our expectations for remodels and relocations in 2020. Overall, we now expect to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores, representing 2,780 real estate projects in total. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2020 to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion as we accelerate key initiatives and continue to invest in our core business to support and drive future growth.  \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in August. Since the end of Q2 and through August 25, we have continued to experience elevated same-store sales, which have increased by approximately 15% during this time frame. That said, we remain cautious in our sales outlook and recognize the significant uncertainty that still exists concerning the duration of the positive operating environment. In particular, we can't speculate as to whether there will be additional government stimulus, or if so, to what degree our business would benefit. Ultimately, we expect to see our comp sales trends moderate as we move through the back half, but believe we are very well positioned to deliver positive sales growth for the balance of the year, even if broader economic conditions deteriorate. \n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will improve operating margin over time, particularly as benefits to gross margin continue to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the back half, particularly as we further accelerate their rollouts. Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the second half as a result of COVID-19, including up to $50 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which Todd mentioned, as well as investments in additional safety measures.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter, executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives, while keeping the customer at the center of all we do. Let me highlight a few of our recent efforts, starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative.\n During the first half, we added more than 30,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we now expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year compared to our previous target of 55,000 cooler doors in 2020. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection.\n Turning now to private brands, which remains a priority as we pursue opportunities to further enhance our value proposition. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the recent relaunch of our office products brand. Looking ahead, our plans include the continued expansion of existing brands as well as the rebranding of several additional product lines as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.\n Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important for our customers as more food continues to be consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,400 stores, with plans to expand more than 7,000 stores by year-end.\n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient package pickup and drop-off service is now available in over 8,000 locations. We now expect to complete our initial rollout to more than 8,500 stores by the end of Q3, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.\n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key focus area for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. During the quarter, the team once again did a phenomenal job working with our global supply partners to ensure product availability. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration while further diversifying our countries of origin.\n We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and accelerated expansion of our private fleet. To this end, we recently announced the purchase of our 18th traditional distribution center in Walton, Kentucky. We anticipate this facility will begin shipping early next year, enabling us to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.\n Finally, shrink remains an opportunity as we continue to build on our success with the electronic article surveillance. Over the past year, we've increased the number of items tagged by more than 40%, and we continue to focus on leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. During the first half, we opened 500 new stores; remodeled 973 stores, including 704 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats; and relocated 43 stores. We also added produce in more than 120 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 870. As John noted, we now expect 2,780 real estate projects in total this year as we continue to deploy capital in these high-return investments while delivering an expanded assortment offering to an additional 200 communities in 2020. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and I am very proud of the team's ability to execute such high volumes of real estate product -- projects despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our operational initiatives consist of building on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand, as evidenced by recent customer survey results, which we are seeing overall satisfaction at all-time highs. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. In total, for fiscal 2020, we now expect to invest up to $123 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to provide them with further support and demonstrate our continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts during these difficult times. As a reminder, these bonuses follow our 2017 investment of nearly $70 million in store manager compensation and training as well as prior and continued investments in employee training, benefits and wages. Importantly, these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, including continued record low store manager turnover, strong applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline as well as record staffing levels over the first half of the year.\n We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, and I was amazed by the team's ability to seamlessly transition to a virtual event, resulting in continued development for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This meeting was once again a testament to how our people truly embrace the Serving Others culture.\n In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can continue to provide continued growth in years ahead.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Jeff. I'm very proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our key strategic initiatives, which we believe better positions us for long-term sustainable growth. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI, as a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI product categories. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 8% comp sales increase in total nonconsumable sales compared to stores without the NCI offering as well as a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate in these stores.\n We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the chain. As a result of our strong performance and learnings to date, our plans now include accelerating the rollout of our NCI offering to more than 5,400 stores by the end of 2020, by incorporating a light version of this initiative into approximately 400 stores. The light version provides for a more streamlined approach as the full NCI assortment is incorporated into space already dedicated to nonconsumable products, resulting in less disruption to the stores and the ability to more aggressively scale this initiative as we move ahead. We believe NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward. And I'm very excited about the additional opportunities to further leverage our success and learnings with this important initiative.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are seeing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, which John noted earlier, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.  \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional new items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 12,000 stores from 8 -- excuse me, from 8 DG Fresh facilities at the end of Q2. Given our success and strong execution to date, we now expect to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 14,000 stores from at least 10 facilities by the end of this year. This compares to our previous expectation of approximately 12,000 stores by year's end.\n Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, all of which have become even more important as a result of COVID-19. Today, customers are seeking safe, familiar and convenient experiences in many aspects of their lives. And in that regard, we believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital assets, are a distinct competitive advantage.\n During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of DG Pickup, our buy online, pick up in the store offering to more than 2,500 stores compared to about 40 stores at the end of Q1, with plans for even more aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we now expect to introduce this offering into essentially all of our stores by the end of Q3. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include the further expansion of DG GO! mobile checkout as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless shopping experience.\n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity investments we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for customers who may seek to limit face-to-face interactions while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in approximately 400 stores compared to more than 30 stores at the end of Q1. And our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.\n Overall, we are focused on controlling what we can control, while taking action, including the acceleration of our strategic initiatives, to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating value for our shareholders.\n In closing, we are excited about our position midway through the year. Our extraordinary first half results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. We are very proud of our people, especially those serving on the front lines, and I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their tireless dedication of fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is, any way you can parse through thinking about the trade-down effect and -- which is bringing more customers to your store, what you mentioned, versus the timing of stimulus? And so I don't know how you sort through both of those factors. \nTodd Vasos: Sure. Yes. We obviously talk to our customers each and every quarter. So we've got real good data from that. But also through our credit card data, we can see that we're getting a trade down at a pretty good clip. And we saw that in Q1, and that continued into Q2. And of course, as we just talked about the first period up to just here in Q3.\n So as we continue to watch this evolve, what we see is very reminiscent to what we saw during the Great Recession, even though it was more of a financial recession versus where we are today. This one is starting to turn more into and look a little bit like that recession. And during that time, obviously, we saw a pretty good trade down. And we've got a nice track record and the playbook to hopefully be able to retain those customers as we continue to move through COVID and hopefully, post COVID.\n But we're really focused on servicing those customers right now that are coming in. And I would tell you that the information we're getting back through our customer work, our proprietary custom work, really speaks to the additional stuff that we've done inside of our store over the last 18 months to 2 years, DG Fresh being the big one, our cooler expansions, and obviously, our NCI, in our nonconsumable initiatives over the last 18 months to 2 years have been very, very fruitful for this customer. So we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see that trade down, and we're as optimistic that we'll be able to keep a great deal of them as we continue to move forward. \nSimeon Gutman: And related to it, can you talk about how you saw the discretionary mix of product evolve during the quarter? And then if you can, into the third quarter? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. As we mentioned in the previous call, it started with consumables stock up at the beginning of the pandemic. Then in April, as we saw the stimulus money in play and people sheltered in place, we saw a pretty significant shift into discretionary categories like home doing phenomenally, toys seasonal. And that continued all the way through Q2, and it's continued to remain very strong.\n I think it's important to note our discretionary business was doing very well coming into this. We've had 9 straight quarters of nonconsumable growth, and I think it really is a testament to what we've done with NCI. Stimulus certainly helped as well as the changing in shopping patterns where people were sheltered in place. But I think what we've done to make this part of the store more relevant than ever with the rotation of goods, the greater variety and aspirational products has really made it relevant and really helped us capture this additional business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: And congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe first on the margin side, how best to think about the drivers of gross margin as we think about the third quarter or the back half of the year? As we think about IMU, nonconsumables and markdowns, which drove outsized expansion in the second quarter? \nJohn Garratt: Thanks, Matt. Good question. I'll maybe start by talking about the drivers of Q2, and that may help inform the balance of the year. We're not giving specific guidance on Q3, but I think it gives you an idea. And I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the performance, 167 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q2 was phenomenal, and that marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion.\n The initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, in particular, are really contributing. If you look at the drivers, the top 3 drivers in Q2, #1 was higher initial markups, and that was driven primarily by DG Fresh. And that's a benefit. We expect to continue to grow as we scale. The second one was mix. We saw the benefit, of course, of stimulus and the changes to shopping behavior I mentioned, but I also believe that, as I said, NCI is playing a meaningful contributor to getting more of that nonconsumable business. And with that higher nonconsumable mix, that was a big driver of the favorable mix as well as we saw a good mix within the mix with categories like health and beauty doing very well within our consumables. And then the third one was higher initial markups -- I'm sorry, rather, the third one was lower promotional activity. We've been talking about it for a few quarters now. We've been more and more targeted with the tools we've put in place to get more bang for the buck with our promotional activity in this environment. It wasn't as necessary.\n So that was the 3 key drivers. As you look ahead, obviously, we got some extra benefit from a pretty -- a very significant shift into nonconsumables, so I wouldn't expect that kind of shift every quarter. That gave us some extra juice. But as you look at the initiatives we have in place, we expect to see a growing benefit from DG Fresh and NCI. And we have a lot of other opportunities to leverage. The team did a great job on category management. We have more opportunity with private brands in foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies. There is some near-term pressure from distribution and transportation costs: one, keeping up with the volume; two, the additional bonuses that we've put in place; and then three, there is some carrier rate pressure, but the team is doing a phenomenal job mitigating that with the actions they have in place.\n So -- and then the last thing is we'll always watch price but we feel very good about where we're priced now. So not commenting specifically on Q3, but just in general, we feel very good about what we've done to drive this continued growth and gross margin expansion. And over the long term, I think we're very well positioned in making the right investments to drive gross margin expansion over the long term and have a lot of levers. \nMatthew Boss: That's great. And then a follow-up on unit growth from here. So with the consolidation of brick-and-mortar retailers laterally, and then tying this to the acceleration of real estate projects that you guys cited for this year. Maybe, Todd, what are you seeing from new store productivity or metrics out of your new stores? And how best to think about the expansion opportunity or long-term saturation, just given the market share in the white space opportunity that this current crisis seems to be opening up. \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I would tell you that we're very pleased with the continued improvements that we continue to make each and every quarter in our store, in the box, making it more relevant to a broad-based amount of consumers in many different type of settings, all the way from our rule, which is our bread and butter, all the way into vertical living with our DGX box. And I would tell you that we still believe we got 12,000-or-so opportunities to place a Dollar General out there across the Continental United States. And obviously, with some of the recent COVID activity and some of the displacement that we've seen, that opportunity continues to expand as far as I'm concerned, and we continue to watch that very carefully. And we have actually done a lot of work into -- we're not ready yet to talk about '21, but we've done a lot of work into our '21 pipeline as well. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about that ability to continue to build stores and attract and retain those customers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Just a couple of things to elaborate on. So first of all, within the NCI, that 8%, I just want to clarify. So those stores that were currently comping 27%, is that how I'm interpreting that statement? And then I guess what I was wondering is, could you talk a little bit about how that's trended over time? And then also how those stores are looking into August? And then I had another separate question. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. So Karen, I think that your back of the envelope is pretty close because we're seeing an outsized benefit in our NCI stores. And the great thing is not only that top line, but of course, that margin line. And the lines will get more and more blurred as we go. And the reason being is that we're moving a lot of the great learnings from NCI into the bulk of the chain as well, which is great because then we're getting benefit in the rest of the chain at the same time that we're growing the NCI piece. And we're taking the best of the best there. So we really like what we see and we continue to be very bullish, and that's the reason why we're expanding that extra 400 stores and doing it in that light version and that light version will give all the items that you see in NCI without all the movement inside the store for that disruption. And we believe that, that may be the unlock as we move into next year to do more of these remodels. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then in terms of the buy online, pick up in store, I mean, that seems like, obviously, a pretty -- being at all stores by year-end is a massive acceleration from, what, the 40 that you're at, at 1Q. So I'm actually wondering if you could talk to what the impact is on the comps for the stores that currently have buy online. And then maybe any color you could give in terms of what the basket looks like at those stores, with the specifically the buy online, pick up in store. \nTodd Vasos: Sure, sure. Well, first of all, we have to say we're at the very start of this journey, right? So football field, we're on our own 10-yard line so we've got a ways to go here. But again, because of the acceleration, you can imagine, we like what we've seen in the early data. But again, it's so early to draw any large or broad-based conclusions. But I would tell you that what we've seen early on in a couple of anecdotes is that the consumer is enjoying the experience, rating the app very high.\n What we're seeing, we saw a little bit in the test stores, and we're seeing it even in the expanded stores now that we're up to over a couple of thousand and soon to roll out to the chain, is that we're seeing -- when the customer comes in to pick up her order, she's actually buying additional items inside the store, which then is increasing that basket size to above where we normally would see our basket size. So we like what we see early on, but we're just -- what we like to say, we're running water through the pipes right now to make sure everything is working, make sure the customer experience is right. And then we'll really start to market it heavy as we move to the backside of this quarter and into Q4, but also into next year to really start to drive some awareness into it.\n We -- lastly, we believe this will be a very big benefit for that trade-down customer I talked about earlier. Because that trade-down customer that we've seen is a little -- skewed a little younger, more digitally savvy with families. And we believe that this will be right up her alley as well as she continues to learn about Dollar General and grow with Dollar General. \nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: Great quarter. I was wondering just if you could comment on the geography of the store base with the urban versus rural exposure, if you saw any meaningful differences between the 2? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. This is Todd again. Actually, what we experienced, which was great to see, is pretty even performance across our rural store base and more of our city setting store base. So once again, we've done a lot of work around our city and/or more urban settings, with much work being done around those type of stores, including our DGX stores. But in saying that, we were very pleased with the overall sales and margin performance was very, very similar in both sides of that. So it was great to see. \nPeter Keith: Okay. Helpful. And then it might be the wrong time to ask, but I do want to kind of circle back on your long-term guidance, and it's been a couple of years since you put out that 10% to 15% EPS growth range that you wanted to achieve annually. How are you thinking about that today? Because it seems like you have a number of initiatives that are all working in conjunction. And perhaps, if anything, that range at this point, looks a bit conservative. \nJohn Garratt: Great question. I'm not going to comment specifically on 2021 or give you any specific predictions. But what I will tell you is we are extremely excited about the fundamentals of the business. We are extremely well positioned. We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term as you look at the unit growth opportunity we have and the long runway there and the type of performance we're seeing from these new units. It's the best performance we've seen in years. When you look at our sales with all the levers that we have, all the initiatives, really clicking to drive the top line and meaningfully the bottom line when you look at our strategic initiatives and the momentum on the comps. And when you look at gross margin, all the levers that we have and the initiatives going after that.\n Obviously, with the cash we generate, substantial cash flow we've been producing, that allows us to reinvest in what we announced was accelerating these initiatives. So we really believe we're extremely well positioned with the initiatives. We really believe what we've been doing to the box has made it more relevant than ever and believe that we're now providing a fuller fill in trip for customers coming in. So as we look to make these larger baskets stick to the extent possible, as we look to keep these new customers that we've attracted coming back, we think we're very well positioned with the initiatives we've put in place and more relevant than ever and very excited about the future. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Was hoping you could maybe just help quantify. You called out a little bit of SG&A pressures as you accelerate some of your initiatives in the back half. I think that was separate from the $50 million in COVID-related costs. So maybe you can just give us a little color, if you can, in just in terms of dollars that you're thinking in the second half there? \nJohn Garratt: We didn't divulge the exact dollar amount. What we did do is we gave new guidance around capital, and so you can kind of extrapolate. That's where a lot of that capital was going toward was these new -- accelerating the initiatives as well as accelerating real estate. On the expense side, I would look at it more as an acceleration of money we were already going to spend as opposed to additional investments. And so you could kind of think about the proportionality of what we're doing in terms of advancing these. So Todd mentioned the 400 additional NCI stores we're doing, we're going to be serving more fresh stores as we going to be serving 14,000 at the end of the year instead of 12,000 stores. We're going to be scaling DG Pickup across the chain in Q3 and adding 200 more projects.\n So I would really look at it more in terms of just proportionately pulling those expenses forward, not additional expenses. And again, all these things we do are aimed at high-return projects where we're really focused on pulling that benefit forward. So there is some front-end pressure of cost with the start-up and the initial costs associated with that, but the benefits far outpace that, and that's really what we're focused on, is pulling more of that benefit forward. \nKelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just another quick one on margins. Obviously, DG Fresh going really well. And in order of magnitude, it sounds like the gross margin benefit from that is larger than mix, which is quite incredible. So just was curious if you could just talk about, as you look at your supply chain today, how much more opportunity is there to bring more in-house versus what you have at third parties? You gave some metrics on stores, but maybe just talk about it a little bit bigger picture. \nTodd Vasos: As we continue to always look to be a low-cost operator, we're always looking at opportunities. While we're still working DG Fresh, our goal is still by the end of next year to be essentially fully self-distributed on our perishable side of the business. But there are some other areas in nonconsumables that we'll be looking at. But also DG Fresh unlocks even greater opportunity down the road of ensuring that our dry network is efficient as possible.\n And that may look like some goods coming out of our traditional DCs and moving into Fresh, leaving more room for other goods in our main DCs. So think of things like candy and water. Some of the things that we can move into our Fresh facilities that makes a lot of sense. And those areas will loosen up a lot of other areas inside of our DCs to make room for other type of goods. So we're looking at all that right now. But as you can imagine, we're squarely focused on ensuring we roll out Fresh at the highest level of execution we can.\n And I can't be more prouder of the team, especially through a very, very dynamic first half, I think, would be the best way to put it, especially with COVID and everything going on. They have executed at a very high level to include our stores and our operators to ensure that we're servicing the customer at a very high level. So couldn't be more happy with DG Fresh, but there's always more room for opportunity as we continue to move forward in distribution. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Todd, when you make the analogy from the current environment to '08, '09, do you see any major differences? And the reason why I asked the question is in '08, '09, you saw a big spike of sales initially after the recession set in. And then you saw a really healthy comp growth for years even after that. So to use that parallel, wouldn't you expect similar growth in the years ahead even after you've anniversary-ed some of the really big comp growth that you've seen recently? \nTodd Vasos: It's a great question, Michael. And I want to frame it up to make sure we all remember, and I was the merchant at that time back in '08, '09, '10. And then there, we did a lot of other work to the box, right, to start to really make it very relevant to the consumer. So at the same time we were seeing a trade in, we were also growing the amount of SKUs. We doubled the amount of SKUs from 2009 to 2011 as an example, right, going from 5,700 to 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs, pretty much where we sit today.\n But I think it's important to also note, we continue to refine that box, and that box is even more relevant today. Now we don't expect to see probably the same amount of outside sales comps for that long of a time, just because of the initiatives that we had then versus now. But the important thing here is we've got some great initiatives that will, in my opinion, make her much more stickier today than she would have been even in '08, '09 because of DG Fresh, because of our digital initiatives, because of NCI and really showing her a real treasure hunt opportunity on the nonconsumable side of the business.\n So very bullish on being able to keep that consumer, probably at a higher rate. We'll just have to see if we get as many of those consumers over the long haul. I'd say we're probably, what, who knows how far we're into COVID. So we'll have to wait until we get to the backside of COVID before we know exactly how many customers we have received or gotten into the brand. And then we're going to do everything possible to continue to keep as many as we can. \nMichael Lasser: Hopefully, we get to the other side soon. \nTodd Vasos: I'm with you. \nMichael Lasser: Yes, right? My follow-up question is on -- speaking of these new customers, as you look at your credit card data, are you seeing more of the growth in the nonconsumable, in the discretionary area coming from those new customers? Because the core DG customer historically has really lived in a tight budget. It doesn't have the excess funds necessarily to buy those nondiscretionary goods -- or those discretionary goods, I should say. And is that the way we should read it? So more of the growth coming in the discretionary categories from those new customers? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you that we were very pleased with our core customers' ability to buy nonconsumables. I would tell you that's more the driver. And now some of that was stimulus related. But again, I believe a lot of it had to do with our ability to attract new customers as well, but also showing her something different because of our nonconsumable initiatives that we've got moving.\n Now as we all know, some of the stimulus has started to wane but as you can tell by our numbers that we've posted through Q2 and into the -- just about the full force period of Q3, that we continue to see a pretty robust customer on both sides of the equation. So she's liking what she sees. She has a little bit of money in her pocket. I think we're seeing a good trade down, which is helping. But our core customer is spending there as well. And I think it really goes to, again, the amount of work we've done. But plus, she's at home a little bit more. She has a little bit more probably disposable income because she's not doing other things. And with that, she really likes what she sees and buying a lot of our products. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: So obviously, overall sales trends were strong through the quarter, remains strong right now, but really being driven by ticket rather than transactions. So how should we think about the concept of gaining market share and the new customers that you've referenced versus lower overall transaction levels? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, our traffic was down, and I'll give you a little anecdote. It was low single digits, so not dramatically down, but down. And we like to see that up, and we strive for that, obviously, all the time. Now in saying that the -- between our core customer having money to be able to do a fuller shop and the trade down that we've got will offset any of that. So we like what we see from the customer base we have. And she is just consolidating her trips, not as much at Dollar General as we may see in other places, but yet, she's consolidating. And so we continue to offer her more and more so that when she's in, she can do a fuller shop and she doesn't feel compelled to have to go elsewhere. So I think that's really what you're seeing from our brand. And we'll continue to show her products that she wants and needs, but also products that may be a surprise and delight. \nScot Ciccarelli: Todd, should we think about the surge that you've seen in discretionary sales as really a function of that fuller shop then? Again, I think a lot of us are trying to get our arms around you always had consumables not outpace discretionary and first time in 10-plus years, you saw that kind of reverse this quarter. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out what drove that and maybe it's the fuller shop, maybe it's something else. \nTodd Vasos: No. When you look at it, and I don't want anybody to take the opinion that our consumable business wasn't very healthy, it was very healthy. It was just outpaced by our nonconsumable or discretionary side of the equation.\n I would tell you, I believe fully that it's a couple of things. One, we are seeing that trade down, and she likes what she sees. And we're seeing repeat in the trade down. We can see it in the credit card data. So not only is she shopping at Schwan's, she has shopped us multiple times during this COVID outbreak and pandemic that we've seen. So it tells us that she likes what she sees, and she's coming back. So she's helping drive and propel that nonconsumable business. But also our core consumer likes what she sees. And she was buying some of that product possibly elsewhere. And I think she now sees the benefit of shopping Dollar General there from all the work that we've done.\n So I'm very bullish on what that looks like as we get to the backside of the pandemic because of all the work we've done. But we are continuing to ensure that working both sides of the equation, meaning the new customer as well as our existing customer. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So Todd, I guess, to start out. So as you look at the COVID crisis, how is your team thinking about some of the permanent benefits that's coming out of this for DG? \nTodd Vasos: Well, we're taking it one day at a time, as you can imagine, just like most people. We're hoping that the pandemic winds down sooner than later. But in saying that, we have seen that new customer. So we believe that's paramount is to keep her and continue to work that. But also, we're seeing real opportunity on a few other fronts. One is to enable us to accelerate our strategic initiatives, which you heard from both myself and John on as well as Jeff.\n And we're very excited about that because, first of all, these initiatives were working well prior to COVID. Now they're working very well, and we know that the consumer is looking both for the goods that we are offering through these initiatives. But also because of being on the forefront of this, not that we knew COVID was coming, but knew that the customer is always looking for more of a convenient and frictionless shopping experience. And we were well out in front of this, right, 18 -- 12 to 18 months ago to create what we've created around our digital efforts and our NCI products and many other things.\n So we see real opportunities there. Karen talked to -- asked about real estate. We see opportunities there, that there'll be some real estate opportunities opened up, we believe, because of this that we'll take advantage of as well. So there's a lot of areas where we know we can take advantage of. But where we're squarely focused on right now is servicing those customers that are coming in because she still really needs us because of this raging pandemic that we hope, again, winds down soon. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And one follow-up question, just on the supply chain. So one of your competitors called out some challenges with out of stocks during their quarter. So just curious where you guys are from a supply chain, especially in categories like home, where you just had really stellar growth during the quarter. \nJeffery Owen: Rupesh, thank you. This is Jeff. First of all, we've said this before, but our teams are out in front of this very early. So I think it's a testament to the collaboration of our merchant team, supply chain and the operators and also the great relationships we have with our vendor partners. So we're seeing steady progress. And we still have, obviously, work to do, but what I can tell you is that the team has been very creative in finding solutions to get product on the shelf for the customer.\n You've heard us say before, we've stood up new SKUs during this, items we never carried before. We've looked at different pack sizes. And so real pleased with the progress of the team. And as we look forward, and we're still suffering from some constraints. But as we look forward, we see that the supply chain that we have is incredibly nimble. And many of the initiatives we have in place have allowed us to get products in and out of the supply chain and distribution center fast. So we'll be ready for that customer when that -- when the inventory is ready for us to distribute to them. So we're pleased with the progress. \nOperator: This concludes Dollar General Corporation's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their exceptional work over the past several months as we continue to navigate this challenging and dynamic operating environment. Throughout this period, our team has remained steadfast in its focus on employee and customer safety, while providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. I could not be more proud of our team's efforts to serve our customers, our communities and each other. \n For over 80 years, Dollar General has served our customers through a unique combination of value and convenience. But it has never been more evident just how essential our role is as our customers depend on us now more than ever for their everyday household needs. We remain committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our expansive network of nearly [ 17,000 ] within 5 miles or more than 75% of the U.S. population, our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in and out access, our broad assortment of everyday household essentials -- essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low price, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and most importantly, our talented and committed associates. \n Let me now highlight some of the actions we've taken to further protect our employees and customers while keeping our operations running with minimal disruption. As we discussed on last quarter's call, with the onset of COVID-19, we quickly and proactively implemented numerous safety protocols across the company based on recommendations by federal state and local government agencies. We continue to monitor CDC and other government guidelines regarding COVID-19 and are adapting our protocols and policies as that guideline evolves. \n As announced in today's release, we invested approximately $13 million in employee appreciation bonuses during the quarter, bringing our total incremental investment and appreciation bonuses to about $73 million through the end of Q2. Additionally, we expect to invest up to $50 million in additional financial incentives in the second half of the year. Overall, these actions have helped to further ensure the continuity of our business at a time when our customers need us most, while recognizing our employees for their extraordinary efforts. \n While navigating the challenging times of COVID-19, our country has simultaneously entered a period of deep reflection on its societal values, including racial equality and other matters of social justice. Our mission at Dollar General is serving others and our core values include respecting the dignity and differences of others. We are committed to ensuring these values are evident in all we do, including working to promote racial equality and social justice across our communities. \n To further advance these efforts, we recently expanded our diversity and inclusion team and announced the combined $5 million pledge with the Dollar General Literacy Foundation to support racial and social justice and education. Additionally, during the quarter, we published our most recent Serving Others report, which highlights many of our efforts on the ESG front. We first published this report in 2019 and expect that it will evolve and expand as we move into the future. \n Beyond these efforts, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General for continued long-term growth. To that end, and from a position of strength, we are pleased to announce the acceleration of several value-creating initiatives, including DG Pickup, DG Fresh and our nonconsumable initiatives. We are also increasing our expectation for remodels and relocations in 2020. We will discuss each of these updates in more detail later in the call. \n Turning now to our second quarter performance. The quarter was once again highlighted by extraordinary growth on both the top and bottom lines as some of the consumer trends we experienced in Q1 related to the pandemic continued in Q2. More specifically, and as we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable business in the month of April and through May 26. These trends continued through the end of Q2, and we're pleased to note that for the second quarter, our 3 nonconsumable product categories in total delivered a combined comp sales percentage increase well in excess of our consumable businesses.\n In terms of our monthly comp cadence, sales increased 21.5% in May, 17.9% in June and 17.2% in July. While we do not typically disclose monthly comp sales, we believe it's helpful in this environment. Overall, second quarter net sales increased 24.4% to $8.7 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 18.8%. These results include significant growth in average basket size, particularly -- partially, excuse me, offset by a decline in customer traffic, as we believe customers consolidated trips in an effort to limit social contact.  \n During the quarter, our highly consumable market share trends, as measured by syndicated data, continued to exhibit strength, including strong double-digit increases in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending July 25, 2020. Importantly, our data suggests another meaningful increase in new customers this quarter compared to Q2 2019, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We are very focused on retaining these new customers and the incremental spend of current customers through the acceleration of several key initiatives, which I noted earlier. We're particularly pleased that we once again delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed to second quarter diluted EPS of $3.12, an increase of 89% over the prior year. Collectively, we view these results as further validation that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balance and sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.  \n We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And with the plans and initiatives we have in place, we believe we are well positioned to serve an even broader set of consumers, even in a challenging economic environment.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Thank you, Jeff. I'm very proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our key strategic initiatives, which we believe better positions us for long-term sustainable growth. Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI, as a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI product categories. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 8% comp sales increase in total nonconsumable sales compared to stores without the NCI offering as well as a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate in these stores.\n We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the chain. As a result of our strong performance and learnings to date, our plans now include accelerating the rollout of our NCI offering to more than 5,400 stores by the end of 2020, by incorporating a light version of this initiative into approximately 400 stores. The light version provides for a more streamlined approach as the full NCI assortment is incorporated into space already dedicated to nonconsumable products, resulting in less disruption to the stores and the ability to more aggressively scale this initiative as we move ahead. We believe NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward. And I'm very excited about the additional opportunities to further leverage our success and learnings with this important initiative.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin. And we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are seeing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, which John noted earlier, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.  \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of more than 55 additional new items, including both national and private brands in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we were self-distributing to more than 12,000 stores from 8 -- excuse me, from 8 DG Fresh facilities at the end of Q2. Given our success and strong execution to date, we now expect to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 14,000 stores from at least 10 facilities by the end of this year. This compares to our previous expectation of approximately 12,000 stores by year's end.\n Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, all of which have become even more important as a result of COVID-19. Today, customers are seeking safe, familiar and convenient experiences in many aspects of their lives. And in that regard, we believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital assets, are a distinct competitive advantage.\n During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of DG Pickup, our buy online, pick up in the store offering to more than 2,500 stores compared to about 40 stores at the end of Q1, with plans for even more aggressive expansion as we move ahead. In fact, we now expect to introduce this offering into essentially all of our stores by the end of Q3. In addition to DG Pickup, our plans include the further expansion of DG GO! mobile checkout as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless shopping experience.\n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity investments we are seeing as a result of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for customers who may seek to limit face-to-face interactions while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in approximately 400 stores compared to more than 30 stores at the end of Q1. And our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.\n Overall, we are focused on controlling what we can control, while taking action, including the acceleration of our strategic initiatives, to further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating value for our shareholders.\n In closing, we are excited about our position midway through the year. Our extraordinary first half results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. We are very proud of our people, especially those serving on the front lines, and I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their tireless dedication of fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Sure. Yes. We obviously talk to our customers each and every quarter. So we've got real good data from that. But also through our credit card data, we can see that we're getting a trade down at a pretty good clip. And we saw that in Q1, and that continued into Q2. And of course, as we just talked about the first period up to just here in Q3.\n So as we continue to watch this evolve, what we see is very reminiscent to what we saw during the Great Recession, even though it was more of a financial recession versus where we are today. This one is starting to turn more into and look a little bit like that recession. And during that time, obviously, we saw a pretty good trade down. And we've got a nice track record and the playbook to hopefully be able to retain those customers as we continue to move through COVID and hopefully, post COVID.\n But we're really focused on servicing those customers right now that are coming in. And I would tell you that the information we're getting back through our customer work, our proprietary custom work, really speaks to the additional stuff that we've done inside of our store over the last 18 months to 2 years, DG Fresh being the big one, our cooler expansions, and obviously, our NCI, in our nonconsumable initiatives over the last 18 months to 2 years have been very, very fruitful for this customer. So we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see that trade down, and we're as optimistic that we'll be able to keep a great deal of them as we continue to move forward. Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I would tell you that we're very pleased with the continued improvements that we continue to make each and every quarter in our store, in the box, making it more relevant to a broad-based amount of consumers in many different type of settings, all the way from our rule, which is our bread and butter, all the way into vertical living with our DGX box. And I would tell you that we still believe we got 12,000-or-so opportunities to place a Dollar General out there across the Continental United States. And obviously, with some of the recent COVID activity and some of the displacement that we've seen, that opportunity continues to expand as far as I'm concerned, and we continue to watch that very carefully. And we have actually done a lot of work into -- we're not ready yet to talk about '21, but we've done a lot of work into our '21 pipeline as well. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about that ability to continue to build stores and attract and retain those customers. Yes. So Karen, I think that your back of the envelope is pretty close because we're seeing an outsized benefit in our NCI stores. And the great thing is not only that top line, but of course, that margin line. And the lines will get more and more blurred as we go. And the reason being is that we're moving a lot of the great learnings from NCI into the bulk of the chain as well, which is great because then we're getting benefit in the rest of the chain at the same time that we're growing the NCI piece. And we're taking the best of the best there. So we really like what we see and we continue to be very bullish, and that's the reason why we're expanding that extra 400 stores and doing it in that light version and that light version will give all the items that you see in NCI without all the movement inside the store for that disruption. And we believe that, that may be the unlock as we move into next year to do more of these remodels. Sure, sure. Well, first of all, we have to say we're at the very start of this journey, right? So football field, we're on our own 10-yard line so we've got a ways to go here. But again, because of the acceleration, you can imagine, we like what we've seen in the early data. But again, it's so early to draw any large or broad-based conclusions. But I would tell you that what we've seen early on in a couple of anecdotes is that the consumer is enjoying the experience, rating the app very high.\n What we're seeing, we saw a little bit in the test stores, and we're seeing it even in the expanded stores now that we're up to over a couple of thousand and soon to roll out to the chain, is that we're seeing -- when the customer comes in to pick up her order, she's actually buying additional items inside the store, which then is increasing that basket size to above where we normally would see our basket size. So we like what we see early on, but we're just -- what we like to say, we're running water through the pipes right now to make sure everything is working, make sure the customer experience is right. And then we'll really start to market it heavy as we move to the backside of this quarter and into Q4, but also into next year to really start to drive some awareness into it.\n We -- lastly, we believe this will be a very big benefit for that trade-down customer I talked about earlier. Because that trade-down customer that we've seen is a little -- skewed a little younger, more digitally savvy with families. And we believe that this will be right up her alley as well as she continues to learn about Dollar General and grow with Dollar General. Yes. This is Todd again. Actually, what we experienced, which was great to see, is pretty even performance across our rural store base and more of our city setting store base. So once again, we've done a lot of work around our city and/or more urban settings, with much work being done around those type of stores, including our DGX stores. But in saying that, we were very pleased with the overall sales and margin performance was very, very similar in both sides of that. So it was great to see. As we continue to always look to be a low-cost operator, we're always looking at opportunities. While we're still working DG Fresh, our goal is still by the end of next year to be essentially fully self-distributed on our perishable side of the business. But there are some other areas in nonconsumables that we'll be looking at. But also DG Fresh unlocks even greater opportunity down the road of ensuring that our dry network is efficient as possible.\n And that may look like some goods coming out of our traditional DCs and moving into Fresh, leaving more room for other goods in our main DCs. So think of things like candy and water. Some of the things that we can move into our Fresh facilities that makes a lot of sense. And those areas will loosen up a lot of other areas inside of our DCs to make room for other type of goods. So we're looking at all that right now. But as you can imagine, we're squarely focused on ensuring we roll out Fresh at the highest level of execution we can.\n And I can't be more prouder of the team, especially through a very, very dynamic first half, I think, would be the best way to put it, especially with COVID and everything going on. They have executed at a very high level to include our stores and our operators to ensure that we're servicing the customer at a very high level. So couldn't be more happy with DG Fresh, but there's always more room for opportunity as we continue to move forward in distribution. It's a great question, Michael. And I want to frame it up to make sure we all remember, and I was the merchant at that time back in '08, '09, '10. And then there, we did a lot of other work to the box, right, to start to really make it very relevant to the consumer. So at the same time we were seeing a trade in, we were also growing the amount of SKUs. We doubled the amount of SKUs from 2009 to 2011 as an example, right, going from 5,700 to 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs, pretty much where we sit today.\n But I think it's important to also note, we continue to refine that box, and that box is even more relevant today. Now we don't expect to see probably the same amount of outside sales comps for that long of a time, just because of the initiatives that we had then versus now. But the important thing here is we've got some great initiatives that will, in my opinion, make her much more stickier today than she would have been even in '08, '09 because of DG Fresh, because of our digital initiatives, because of NCI and really showing her a real treasure hunt opportunity on the nonconsumable side of the business.\n So very bullish on being able to keep that consumer, probably at a higher rate. We'll just have to see if we get as many of those consumers over the long haul. I'd say we're probably, what, who knows how far we're into COVID. So we'll have to wait until we get to the backside of COVID before we know exactly how many customers we have received or gotten into the brand. And then we're going to do everything possible to continue to keep as many as we can. I'm with you. Yes. I would tell you that we were very pleased with our core customers' ability to buy nonconsumables. I would tell you that's more the driver. And now some of that was stimulus related. But again, I believe a lot of it had to do with our ability to attract new customers as well, but also showing her something different because of our nonconsumable initiatives that we've got moving.\n Now as we all know, some of the stimulus has started to wane but as you can tell by our numbers that we've posted through Q2 and into the -- just about the full force period of Q3, that we continue to see a pretty robust customer on both sides of the equation. So she's liking what she sees. She has a little bit of money in her pocket. I think we're seeing a good trade down, which is helping. But our core customer is spending there as well. And I think it really goes to, again, the amount of work we've done. But plus, she's at home a little bit more. She has a little bit more probably disposable income because she's not doing other things. And with that, she really likes what she sees and buying a lot of our products. Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, our traffic was down, and I'll give you a little anecdote. It was low single digits, so not dramatically down, but down. And we like to see that up, and we strive for that, obviously, all the time. Now in saying that the -- between our core customer having money to be able to do a fuller shop and the trade down that we've got will offset any of that. So we like what we see from the customer base we have. And she is just consolidating her trips, not as much at Dollar General as we may see in other places, but yet, she's consolidating. And so we continue to offer her more and more so that when she's in, she can do a fuller shop and she doesn't feel compelled to have to go elsewhere. So I think that's really what you're seeing from our brand. And we'll continue to show her products that she wants and needs, but also products that may be a surprise and delight. No. When you look at it, and I don't want anybody to take the opinion that our consumable business wasn't very healthy, it was very healthy. It was just outpaced by our nonconsumable or discretionary side of the equation.\n I would tell you, I believe fully that it's a couple of things. One, we are seeing that trade down, and she likes what she sees. And we're seeing repeat in the trade down. We can see it in the credit card data. So not only is she shopping at Schwan's, she has shopped us multiple times during this COVID outbreak and pandemic that we've seen. So it tells us that she likes what she sees, and she's coming back. So she's helping drive and propel that nonconsumable business. But also our core consumer likes what she sees. And she was buying some of that product possibly elsewhere. And I think she now sees the benefit of shopping Dollar General there from all the work that we've done.\n So I'm very bullish on what that looks like as we get to the backside of the pandemic because of all the work we've done. But we are continuing to ensure that working both sides of the equation, meaning the new customer as well as our existing customer. Well, we're taking it one day at a time, as you can imagine, just like most people. We're hoping that the pandemic winds down sooner than later. But in saying that, we have seen that new customer. So we believe that's paramount is to keep her and continue to work that. But also, we're seeing real opportunity on a few other fronts. One is to enable us to accelerate our strategic initiatives, which you heard from both myself and John on as well as Jeff.\n And we're very excited about that because, first of all, these initiatives were working well prior to COVID. Now they're working very well, and we know that the consumer is looking both for the goods that we are offering through these initiatives. But also because of being on the forefront of this, not that we knew COVID was coming, but knew that the customer is always looking for more of a convenient and frictionless shopping experience. And we were well out in front of this, right, 18 -- 12 to 18 months ago to create what we've created around our digital efforts and our NCI products and many other things.\n So we see real opportunities there. Karen talked to -- asked about real estate. We see opportunities there, that there'll be some real estate opportunities opened up, we believe, because of this that we'll take advantage of as well. So there's a lot of areas where we know we can take advantage of. But where we're squarely focused on right now is servicing those customers that are coming in because she still really needs us because of this raging pandemic that we hope, again, winds down soon."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. In addition, please note that Q2 2019 adjusted results exclude a $31 million pretax impact related to significant legal expenses recorded in the quarter, as discussed in today's earnings release.  \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 167 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur employee appreciation bonus expense.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.4%, a decrease of 205 basis points or 161 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted SG&A. Although we incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales in the quarter include retail labor, occupancy costs, utilities, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation and charitable giving expenses. As I mentioned, we also recorded expenses of $31 million in Q2 2019, reflecting  estimate the settlement of certain legal matters.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 80.5% or 71.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 12%, an increase of 373 basis points or 329 basis points compared to Q2 2019 adjusted operating profit. Operating profit in the second quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $38 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers and approximately $13 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the second quarter was $3.12, which represents an increase of 89% or 79% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers' employees during these challenging times while continuing to invest for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, essentially flat overall and down 6% on a per-store basis. Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion or 157%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance combined with lower levels of inventory as our supply chain teams continue to work closely with our vendor partners to improve in-stock levels for high demand products. Total capital expenditures through the first half were $424 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  \n Moving on to liquidity and capital structure. We continue to have ample liquidity as a result of the measures we took earlier in the year to further bolster our liquidity position, coupled with our extremely strong cash flow in the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. As one of the measures to preserve liquidity at the onset of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended share repurchases during Q1. We continue to evaluate business conditions and our liquidity, and as a result of this evaluation, we resumed share repurchases in the second quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for $602 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $90 million. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.5 billion under the repurchase program.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. We continue to operate in a time of significant uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. As a result, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2020 sales or EPS at this time. With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business.  \n As Todd noted earlier, we are increasing our expectations for remodels and relocations in 2020. Overall, we now expect to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,670 stores and relocate 110 stores, representing 2,780 real estate projects in total. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2020 to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion as we accelerate key initiatives and continue to invest in our core business to support and drive future growth.  \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in August. Since the end of Q2 and through August 25, we have continued to experience elevated same-store sales, which have increased by approximately 15% during this time frame. That said, we remain cautious in our sales outlook and recognize the significant uncertainty that still exists concerning the duration of the positive operating environment. In particular, we can't speculate as to whether there will be additional government stimulus, or if so, to what degree our business would benefit. Ultimately, we expect to see our comp sales trends moderate as we move through the back half, but believe we are very well positioned to deliver positive sales growth for the balance of the year, even if broader economic conditions deteriorate. \n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will improve operating margin over time, particularly as benefits to gross margin continue to scale and outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, our investment in these initiatives will pressure SG&A rates in the back half, particularly as we further accelerate their rollouts. Finally, we expect to make additional investments in the second half as a result of COVID-19, including up to $50 million in employee appreciation bonuses, which Todd mentioned, as well as investments in additional safety measures.  \n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and service, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Sure. As we mentioned in the previous call, it started with consumables stock up at the beginning of the pandemic. Then in April, as we saw the stimulus money in play and people sheltered in place, we saw a pretty significant shift into discretionary categories like home doing phenomenally, toys seasonal. And that continued all the way through Q2, and it's continued to remain very strong.\n I think it's important to note our discretionary business was doing very well coming into this. We've had 9 straight quarters of nonconsumable growth, and I think it really is a testament to what we've done with NCI. Stimulus certainly helped as well as the changing in shopping patterns where people were sheltered in place. But I think what we've done to make this part of the store more relevant than ever with the rotation of goods, the greater variety and aspirational products has really made it relevant and really helped us capture this additional business. Thanks, Matt. Good question. I'll maybe start by talking about the drivers of Q2, and that may help inform the balance of the year. We're not giving specific guidance on Q3, but I think it gives you an idea. And I'll start by saying how pleased we are with the performance, 167 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q2 was phenomenal, and that marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion.\n The initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, in particular, are really contributing. If you look at the drivers, the top 3 drivers in Q2, #1 was higher initial markups, and that was driven primarily by DG Fresh. And that's a benefit. We expect to continue to grow as we scale. The second one was mix. We saw the benefit, of course, of stimulus and the changes to shopping behavior I mentioned, but I also believe that, as I said, NCI is playing a meaningful contributor to getting more of that nonconsumable business. And with that higher nonconsumable mix, that was a big driver of the favorable mix as well as we saw a good mix within the mix with categories like health and beauty doing very well within our consumables. And then the third one was higher initial markups -- I'm sorry, rather, the third one was lower promotional activity. We've been talking about it for a few quarters now. We've been more and more targeted with the tools we've put in place to get more bang for the buck with our promotional activity in this environment. It wasn't as necessary.\n So that was the 3 key drivers. As you look ahead, obviously, we got some extra benefit from a pretty -- a very significant shift into nonconsumables, so I wouldn't expect that kind of shift every quarter. That gave us some extra juice. But as you look at the initiatives we have in place, we expect to see a growing benefit from DG Fresh and NCI. And we have a lot of other opportunities to leverage. The team did a great job on category management. We have more opportunity with private brands in foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies. There is some near-term pressure from distribution and transportation costs: one, keeping up with the volume; two, the additional bonuses that we've put in place; and then three, there is some carrier rate pressure, but the team is doing a phenomenal job mitigating that with the actions they have in place.\n So -- and then the last thing is we'll always watch price but we feel very good about where we're priced now. So not commenting specifically on Q3, but just in general, we feel very good about what we've done to drive this continued growth and gross margin expansion. And over the long term, I think we're very well positioned in making the right investments to drive gross margin expansion over the long term and have a lot of levers. Great question. I'm not going to comment specifically on 2021 or give you any specific predictions. But what I will tell you is we are extremely excited about the fundamentals of the business. We are extremely well positioned. We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term as you look at the unit growth opportunity we have and the long runway there and the type of performance we're seeing from these new units. It's the best performance we've seen in years. When you look at our sales with all the levers that we have, all the initiatives, really clicking to drive the top line and meaningfully the bottom line when you look at our strategic initiatives and the momentum on the comps. And when you look at gross margin, all the levers that we have and the initiatives going after that.\n Obviously, with the cash we generate, substantial cash flow we've been producing, that allows us to reinvest in what we announced was accelerating these initiatives. So we really believe we're extremely well positioned with the initiatives. We really believe what we've been doing to the box has made it more relevant than ever and believe that we're now providing a fuller fill in trip for customers coming in. So as we look to make these larger baskets stick to the extent possible, as we look to keep these new customers that we've attracted coming back, we think we're very well positioned with the initiatives we've put in place and more relevant than ever and very excited about the future. We didn't divulge the exact dollar amount. What we did do is we gave new guidance around capital, and so you can kind of extrapolate. That's where a lot of that capital was going toward was these new -- accelerating the initiatives as well as accelerating real estate. On the expense side, I would look at it more as an acceleration of money we were already going to spend as opposed to additional investments. And so you could kind of think about the proportionality of what we're doing in terms of advancing these. So Todd mentioned the 400 additional NCI stores we're doing, we're going to be serving more fresh stores as we going to be serving 14,000 at the end of the year instead of 12,000 stores. We're going to be scaling DG Pickup across the chain in Q3 and adding 200 more projects.\n So I would really look at it more in terms of just proportionately pulling those expenses forward, not additional expenses. And again, all these things we do are aimed at high-return projects where we're really focused on pulling that benefit forward. So there is some front-end pressure of cost with the start-up and the initial costs associated with that, but the benefits far outpace that, and that's really what we're focused on, is pulling more of that benefit forward."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter, executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives, while keeping the customer at the center of all we do. Let me highlight a few of our recent efforts, starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative.\n During the first half, we added more than 30,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we now expect to install more than 60,000 cooler doors this year compared to our previous target of 55,000 cooler doors in 2020. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection.\n Turning now to private brands, which remains a priority as we pursue opportunities to further enhance our value proposition. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the recent relaunch of our office products brand. Looking ahead, our plans include the continued expansion of existing brands as well as the rebranding of several additional product lines as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.\n Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important for our customers as more food continues to be consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,400 stores, with plans to expand more than 7,000 stores by year-end.\n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient package pickup and drop-off service is now available in over 8,000 locations. We now expect to complete our initial rollout to more than 8,500 stores by the end of Q3, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.\n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a key focus area for us. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with our NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. During the quarter, the team once again did a phenomenal job working with our global supply partners to ensure product availability. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to increase our foreign sourcing penetration while further diversifying our countries of origin.\n We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and accelerated expansion of our private fleet. To this end, we recently announced the purchase of our 18th traditional distribution center in Walton, Kentucky. We anticipate this facility will begin shipping early next year, enabling us to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.\n Finally, shrink remains an opportunity as we continue to build on our success with the electronic article surveillance. Over the past year, we've increased the number of items tagged by more than 40%, and we continue to focus on leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. During the first half, we opened 500 new stores; remodeled 973 stores, including 704 in the higher cooler count DGTP or DGP formats; and relocated 43 stores. We also added produce in more than 120 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to more than 870. As John noted, we now expect 2,780 real estate projects in total this year as we continue to deploy capital in these high-return investments while delivering an expanded assortment offering to an additional 200 communities in 2020. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and I am very proud of the team's ability to execute such high volumes of real estate product -- projects despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as save to serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our operational initiatives consist of building on our success with Fast Track, which Todd will discuss in more detail. As a result of our efforts to date, our store associates are able to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand, as evidenced by recent customer survey results, which we are seeing overall satisfaction at all-time highs. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. In total, for fiscal 2020, we now expect to invest up to $123 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to provide them with further support and demonstrate our continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts during these difficult times. As a reminder, these bonuses follow our 2017 investment of nearly $70 million in store manager compensation and training as well as prior and continued investments in employee training, benefits and wages. Importantly, these investments continue to yield positive results across our store base, including continued record low store manager turnover, strong applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline as well as record staffing levels over the first half of the year.\n We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, and I was amazed by the team's ability to seamlessly transition to a virtual event, resulting in continued development for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This meeting was once again a testament to how our people truly embrace the Serving Others culture.\n In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and our operating priorities continue to provide a strong foundation from which we can continue to provide continued growth in years ahead.\n And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Rupesh, thank you. This is Jeff. First of all, we've said this before, but our teams are out in front of this very early. So I think it's a testament to the collaboration of our merchant team, supply chain and the operators and also the great relationships we have with our vendor partners. So we're seeing steady progress. And we still have, obviously, work to do, but what I can tell you is that the team has been very creative in finding solutions to get product on the shelf for the customer.\n You've heard us say before, we've stood up new SKUs during this, items we never carried before. We've looked at different pack sizes. And so real pleased with the progress of the team. And as we look forward, and we're still suffering from some constraints. But as we look forward, we see that the supply chain that we have is incredibly nimble. And many of the initiatives we have in place have allowed us to get products in and out of the supply chain and distribution center fast. So we'll be ready for that customer when that -- when the inventory is ready for us to distribute to them. So we're pleased with the progress."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Dollar General First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, May 28, 2020. [Operator Instructions] This is call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\n Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call.\n These are certainly unprecedented times for us all, and our hearts go out to the communities and individuals affected by the COVID-19 crisis. On behalf of Dollar General, I want to express our deepest gratitude to those serving on the front lines and especially to our teammates for their dedicated and efforts in fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient, and close-to-home access to essential items at a time when our customers need them most. I'm inspired by the phenomenal work our associates are doing and could not be more proud of how they've responded to the needs of our communities. In recognition of the essential work performed by our employees in April, the New York Stock Exchange recognized one of our store managers, Crystal Burroughs, during the #Gratitude campaign, where the exchange join millions of others in honoring the way people on the front lines have responded to the COVID-19 crisis.\n As one of America's essential retailers, we are committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times, and are continuing to support these efforts through our expansive network of more than 16,000 store locations currently located within 5 miles of more than 75% of the U.S. population. Our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in-and-out access and limited crowds, both of which are conducive to social distancing. Our broad assortment of everyday household essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low prices, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and recent measures taking to further safeguard the well-being of both our team members and customers and of course, our talented and committed associates.\n For more than 80 years, Dollar General has served customers through a unique combination of value and convenience, and we will continue to be there for them in both good and challenging times.\n Let me now highlight some of the key actions we've taken in response to COVID-19 with 2 key priorities in mind. First is the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities we serve. Second is maintaining the continuity of our business and operations.\n For our employees and customers, we took swift and proactive action to keep them safe, while keeping stores open and running with minimal disruption. We closed 1 hour early to allow greater time for stocking and enhanced cleaning protocols, distributed masks and gloves to all employees, implemented social distancing measures in our stores, distribution centers and at-the-store support center, and completed the installation of nearly 40,000 plexiglass barriers at checkout across the entire chain. To further support heightened demand, we have hired over 50,000 people since mid-March, nearly double our normal hiring rate. We are happy to welcome these new employees to our team, and our hiring efforts are continuing. We also invested approximately $60 million in employee appreciation bonuses and provided enhanced benefits and resources, including expanded paid leave and greater access to telehealth services. And we contributed to our employee assistance foundation to assist our coworkers during times of need. All these actions have helped to ensure the continuity of our business at a time when customers need us most.\n To support our communities, we dedicated the first hour of each day to seniors and provided a discount for first responders, medical personnel and National Guard members. And through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, Save the Children, an organization working to ensure children in rural America continue to learn and have access to nutritious food during nationwide school closures, will receive a $2 million donation.\n Beyond these actions, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to further meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General to emerge from this crisis even stronger than before.\n Turning now to our first quarter performance. The quarter was highlighted by extraordinary growth in both top and bottom lines. These results reflect significant changes in shopping patterns, which began in March as consumers reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the month of February, same-store sales increased 5.5%, driven by broad-based performance across many fronts, which we believe speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum of the underlying business.\n Beginning in March, we experienced a significant surge in demand and sales as consumers began to stock up, and category mix shifted even more than usual to our consumable category. For the month in total, comp sales increased 34.5%. April sales moderated in comparison to March, but remained elevated as consumers continue to replenish household essentials at a rate greater than normal. During April, we also experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable businesses. And our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a combined comp sales increase in excess of our consumable business. For the month in total, same-store sales increased 21.5%. Overall, first quarter net sales increased 27.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 21.7%, including significant growth in average basket size and a meaningful increase in customer traffic.\n Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data. Importantly, our data suggests a meaningful increase in new customers, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition.\n We're particularly pleased that we delivered a significant operating margin expansion this quarter, which contributed to diluted EPS of $2.56, an increase of 73% over prior year. Collectively, these results reflect our commitment to doing everything we can to support our employees, customers and communities during this time and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and having established an even stronger bond with the existing customers during these unprecedented times. Combined with the actions we've taken to forge new customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth, even in what's expected to be a challenging economic environment.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to echo Todd's gratitude to our employees and note that my thoughts are with those who've been impacted by this crisis.\n Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the first quarter, let me take you through some of the financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 30.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 49 basis points. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur discretionary bonus expense.\n SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 20.5%, a decrease of 204 basis points. Although we incurred certain incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of net sales this quarter include: Occupancy costs, retail labor, utilities, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 69.2% to $867 million compared to $512 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 10.3%, an increase of 253 basis points. We believe the impact of COVID-19 significantly benefited operating profit in Q1, primarily through higher sales, partially offset by approximately $80 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $60 million in appreciation bonuses and nearly $20 million in measures taken to further protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as enhanced benefits programs to support our store associates, distribution center employees and private fleet drivers.\n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 20.8% in the first quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the first quarter increased 73% to $2.56.\n Turning now to our cash flow and balance sheet, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to better support our customers, employees during these difficult times. The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter, totaling $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 202%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance, combined with lower levels of inventory as we continue to work closely with suppliers to improve in-stocks for high-demand products. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, essentially flat to prior year and a decrease of 5.5% on a per-store basis. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $195 million, and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $63 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $91 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.1 billion. In light of the COVID-19 uncertainty, and out of an abundance of caution, we proactively took steps during the quarter to further bolster our already strong liquidity position, including the temporary suspension of share repurchases and the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes on April 3. These measures, along with our strong cash flow, put us in an even stronger liquidity position with $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility at the end of Q1.\n Importantly, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases when it is prudent to do so and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. Let me start by acknowledging the inherent and significant uncertainty that continues to exist around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. In addition, the timing, scope and impact of both current and anticipated stimulus legislation and other governmental responses to the pandemic remains to be seen. As a result, it is difficult to predict specific outcomes. And while we expect to exceed our prior guidance for fiscal 2020 net sales, same-store sales and EPS, we are unable to estimate the extent of such upside with reasonable accuracy.  Accordingly, we are withdrawing our sales, earnings and share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2020 that was issued on March 12, 2020, in conjunction with our Q4 earnings call. With regards to share repurchases, we are constantly evaluating our position and intend to resume our share buyback activity when it is prudent and advisable to do so, which may be as early as the 2020 second quarter. Finally, our 2020 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we issued in our Q4 earnings release on March 12, 2020.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends, thus far, in May. Since the end of Q1 and through May 26, we have continued to experience elevated consumer demand in our stores, albeit with some intermittent moderation and in particular, over some of the more recent days. Overall, same-store sales have increased by approximately 22% during this time frame. That said, it is important to note that there are a number of factors which suggest that sales will moderate to more normalized levels beginning during the latter part of Q2, including the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the gradual reopening of other retailers, the tapering of benefits included in recent stimulus legislation and managing through what is likely to be a more challenging economic environment for our consumers.\n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to gross profit rate this year, specifically our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI and DG Fresh. In addition, we also expect continued and meaningful investment in our initiatives this year, including ongoing expenses associated with each. We continue to believe these investments will improve operating margin over time, particularly as the benefits to gross margin continue to scale and ultimately outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, these investments will continue to pressure SG&A rates this year as we accelerate their rollouts.\n In closing, I want to reiterate that we are very proud of the team's execution and service during the quarter. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. I'd like to start by also thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication as we navigate this difficult time. I want to take the few -- next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives despite the challenges surrounding COVID-19. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts.\n Starting with our cooler door expansion, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we installed more than 15,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 55,000 cooler doors in 2020, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.\n Turning now to private brands, which continues to be a priority as we pursue opportunities to deliver even greater value for our customers, while also driving profitable sales growth. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the relaunch of our laundry brand under the Trueliving label. In addition, our Clover Valley redesign has begun rolling out, with over 250 items now available and more to come as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.\n Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important during a time when more food is being consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,000 stores, with plans to expand to nearly 7,000 stores by year-end.\n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This service is currently available in approximately 4,800 locations, with plans to expand to over 8,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our strategy of leveraging our unique real estate footprint to increase customer access to services in convenient and nearby locations.\n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a critical area of focus for us. In addition to some of our strategic initiatives, which Todd will discuss later, as well as our private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. Our efforts this quarter were focused on supporting the business in a rapidly changing global environment. The team did a tremendous job of working closely with each of our supply partners to ensure product availability, including pursuing product substitutions and shifting production to other countries when warranted. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant opportunity to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while also further diversifying our countries of origin as we seek to provide even greater value and an enhanced assortment offering for our customers.\n We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and continued expansion of our private fleet. We're especially proud of the team's efforts during the quarter as we delivered against record volumes, while constantly working with our vendor partners to minimize disruptions to supply. We are also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink and to our category management process.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of the business and enhances our ability to bring value and convenience to even more customers across the country. As one of America's essential retailers, we're committed to providing customers with even greater access to essential goods, especially during these unprecedented times. To that end, in the first quarter, we opened 250 new stores, remodeled 481 stores, including 332 in the higher cooler count, DGTP or DGP formats and relocated 17 stores. We also expanded the number of stores offering fresh produce, bringing the total [indiscernible] produce to approximately 750. And despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19, our best-in-class real estate team has worked diligently with our communities and business partners to keep our real estate plans on track for 2020. As a result, we are maintaining our real estate outlook for the year as we plan to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,500 new store -- excuse me, 1,500 stores, and relocate 80 stores, representing nearly 2,600 real estate projects in total. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's continued ability to execute such high volumes of real estate projects, which is a testament to their dedication to serving new and existing customers.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This save-to-serve approach has served us well in navigating the current environment, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our ongoing efforts to further supply our -- to simplify our operations have been an important factor in eliminating unnecessary tasks. In turn, this has allowed for our store associates to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. The strength and dedication of our people was on full display during the quarter as we heard countless stories of our frontline employees going above and beyond the call of duty to serve our customers and communities. As Todd noted earlier, we made a significant investment of approximately $60 million in employee bonuses to demonstrate continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts to serve our customers and fulfill the company's mission of serving others. We believe these bonuses, as well as our other investments and benefits, such as additional paid leave, were well received. In fact, we continue to see record low turnover at the store manager level, as well as lower turnover across our associate base. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our strong applicant flows, as evidenced by the hiring of more than 50,000 people since mid-March. We also continue to embrace innovative approaches to training and development and have recently transitioned to a virtual training environment, resulting in the continued development of our people despite the inability to travel. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with an innovative and growing retailer is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and these operating priorities continue to provide the foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you over the past several quarters, we're investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further support long-term sustainable growth. Importantly, as a result of our efforts and investments to date, we believe we are even better positioned to move quickly alongside our customers as we continue to meet their rapidly evolving needs, further accelerated by COVID-19.\n Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights, starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of the quarter, and we plan to expand the offering to a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of 2020. We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores delivered in the quarter. We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions to all of our overall first quarter results. These results reinforce our belief that NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward, and gives us confidence in our rollout plans for 2020.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the preliminary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third-party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories by enabling the accelerated rollout of our high capacity coolers, increasing in-stock levels and eventually expanding our overall assortment offering. Importantly, we are already seeing evidence of success against these goals, including meaningful increase in perishable sales and higher overall in-stock levels in stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we are now self-distributing to more than 9,000 stores from 6 DG Fresh facilities. Our goal for 2020 is to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 12,000 stores from up to 10 facilities, including our first combination facility co-located with our existing dry goods distribution center in Zanesville, Ohio.\n We continue to believe this initiative will be accretive to operating margin in 2020, as the benefits begin to exceed associated expenses and growing in the years ahead as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.\n Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to providing our core customer with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. We believe essential brick-and-mortar retailers continue to serve a critical role, and that has never been more evident than in the past few months. We believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital efforts, have positioned us well in a challenging and changing retail landscape, particularly as we consider the possibilities in a post COVID-19 environment.\n More specifically, DG Pickup, which is our buy online and pickup-in-the-store offering, provides an important access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. We launched a pilot of this solution at the end of Q4 and are very pleased with the initial results, including positive feedback from both customers and employees. Importantly, we are well positioned to scale quickly with plans for rapid expansion as we move ahead. Beyond DG Pickup, DG GO! mobile checkout is currently available in approximately 750 stores, with plans to further expand as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless checkout solution.\n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We are pleased with the store labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a results of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. These improvements are particularly notable in the quarter as our teams work diligently and efficiently to keep products on the shelf. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for consumers who may seek to limit face-to-face interaction, while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in more than 30 stores, and our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.\n Overall, we continue to make great progress with our strategic initiatives, while advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.\n In closing, we are proud of our strong start to 2020. Our results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment and come out the other side stronger together with the communities we serve. Importantly, we are very proud of our people, specifically those serving on the front lines, including our store associates, distribution center employees and those in our private fleet. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 155,000 employees across the company for their tireless commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: You mentioned that your confidence have moderated a bit in recent days. What has been the magnitude of the moderation? And has it been more so due to other stores reopening and shelter-in-place restrictions being lifted? Or because you're seeing a fading benefit of those stimulus dollars? \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Michael. This is John. And providing a little more context here, we alluded to in the prepared comments that through Q1, through May 26, our same-store sales have increased by 22% during this time frame and had mentioned some intermittent moderation over recent days. Given the unprecedented environment and the spirit of transparency, I do think it's fair to give more color on the recent trends. What we've seen in some recent days is some days in the mid-teens, but we've seen it bounce back in recent days into the mid-20s. So things have been fluid, but sales are still very healthy and we believe we're very well positioned. We're seeing strength in both sides of the box on the consumables side and the nonconsumables. And I think an interesting stat we've seen floating around is just how much people have their stimulus money still deposited in the banks, which leads you to believe there's some tail to that. But we're still seeing strength in both sides of the business and believe with our unique combination of value and convenience, we're very well positioned. \nMichael Lasser: That's really helpful. My follow-up question is inevitably, and you mentioned that as part of these very healthy comp trends, you've experienced growth from new customers. Are you -- how can you size that contribution? Is it 1/3, 1/4, maybe 1/2 of the overall growth in comp from these new customers? But do you think these new customers will be sticky than what you've enjoyed in the past? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Michael, it's Todd. Thank you. Yes, we have seen an increase in customers. And no surprise, right? When the going gets tough, we know that our customers need us more and we're there for them. But we also know from past recessionary times that -- and in times of these, that we have a customer that also starts to trade into Dollar General. We saw that in a very big way in Q1. We can validate that pretty easily through credit card data that we've seen, but also through, as you know, we do extensive quarterly customer interactions and reach-outs. And we know exactly where our customers stand as well as new customers. And I would tell you, those reach-outs to our customers have told us this quarter that not only did we trade in, we loved what we saw, and we plan to repeat shop, if they haven't already. So we're very, very bullish on that. And I think it's a real testament to the work the team has done on this box to make it the most relevant it's been in many, many years. And I would tell you that just like we probably saw in '08, '09, with new customers coming in, they're delighted to see all the changes that we've made. And just like that, I'm very bullish that we'll continue to hold on to those customers for the long term. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And congrats on a nice quarter, guys. Todd, maybe could you speak to the overall health of your core consumer today, the push and pull between rising unemployment and your ability to deliver value as we think about the 2008, 2009 playbook. I guess maybe larger, what's the economic sweet spot that you think for your model? And if you had to rank initiatives to take additional market share out of this crisis, what would they be? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Michael. Thank you. The customer was feeling very good. I think it was a real testament. She was back to work leading into this crisis. So when you look at our strong comp in the month of February, which really had virtually no COVID-related retail in it, she was very, very -- in a very good shape, probably the best we've seen in many, many years. What that was a -- what that enabled her to be able to do was to stock up with confidence, and we saw that early on. She came in and really stocked up first, starting like with paper goods and moving into food. And then obviously, once stimulus started to rollout, we saw, obviously, like other retailers, a surge in our discretionary type categories.\n Right now, what I would tell you, because we do talk to her very frequently, as I mentioned earlier, she has a lot more trepidation, obviously, just because of what's going on. But I would tell you that she still has money in her pocket. It's evidenced by what she's doing. But I think a lot of that extra money right now is driven by stimulus, both the basic stimulus that was sent out starting middle of April. But also for perhaps any unemployment that may be needed for our core customer which, by the way, there's evidence to show maybe our core customer is not having to capitalize yet on that because they're most likely frontline workers like many of America's customers today out there. And so she's got a lot of money still in her pocket. But we're watching it very, very closely because that can turn, and we understand that, and we're watching it. But we also are watching when stimulus starts to taper off. And of course, with additional snap benefits that are out there, that's helping as well. So when you put it all together, we feel that we're very well positioned.\n The sweet spot, I would tell you, we do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times. But I would rather see our core consumer, they have money in her pocket and be able to spend equally on both our consumable and nonconsumable businesses. But we're very, very bullish on what post-COVID looks like because, again, I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall. \nMatthew Boss: Great answer. Maybe, John, to follow up on the gross margin. What's the best way to think about markdowns, markups and distribution in the second quarter, in the back half as we think about the drivers behind your first quarter gross margin expansion? And any other accelerating tailwinds to consider as Fresh continues to ramp or opportunity on the freight side? \nJohn Garratt: Thanks, Matthew. I'll walk you through the puts and takes. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the Q1 gross margin expansion of 49 basis points. One of the things we didn't call out as a driver was product mix, not a material impact on margin pressure. That really speaks to the surge we saw in nonconsumables, particularly as the stimulus payments came out. That, coupled with the mix within the mix, within consumables, we saw strength in categories like health and beauty, which has margin rates more akin to nonconsumables. So the combination of those helped balance out the mix pressure from the initial surge in consumables and made it really not a material impact for Q1.\n What we did see driving benefit in Q1 is what we have been seeing and calling out in recent quarters. One was lower markdowns as a percentage of net sales was the top one. The team remains very targeted on their promotional spending. And then the second one we called out was initial markups on inventory purchases, and that's really DG Fresh. We are seeing the substantial cost benefit we expected to see as we self-distribute frozen refrigerated goods and seeing a growing benefit from NCI as well. So while it's hard to get very specific around Q2 or the following quarters given the dynamics -- the near-term dynamics, what I would say is that we continue to see opportunities to continue increasing our margins over time with the growing benefit of initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. And the other levers we have, the team continues to do a fabulous job with category management. Private brands, where we've seen elevated sales in recent quarters, and there's a big opportunity in foreign sourcing.\n Supply chain, you asked specifically around supply chain. Obviously, there's a little bit of geography there as we take over self-distribution of frozen refrigerated goods. We take on a little bit more cost there, but we save a lot more on the product cost side. But when you strip that out, it's been doing very well driving efficiencies as the team has been working on reducing transportation rates where they've been successful as we've expanded and diversified our carrier base, expanded our private fleet. We're seeing lower fuel costs and they continue to do an excellent job driving efficiencies through stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.\n And then the other one that we didn't really call out this quarter because it wasn't material with shrink, we continue to see an opportunity for shrink over the long term. We're looking forward to the latter part of the year as we see the benefit -- hope to see the benefit of the EAS units, the 6,000 units we installed, completing the chain at the end of last year, looking to see the continued benefit we've seen in the past from those, as well as increased tagging now that we've completed the system.\n So I think when you put all those together, we feel very well positioned. Now we always reserve the right to invest in price if needed. But we believe we're in a great position right now with price, and believe we're making the right investments to drive margin expansion over the long-term and believe we have the levers to do so. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: A little bit of a follow-up to the last one. I mean there's a lot of dollars coming in right now to the business, and I want to ask about reinvestment rate.\n First, on gross margin. I know, John, you just mentioned you feel good about where pricing is. Can you talk about the price elasticity in general? And if you can measure it in this environment? And whether it makes sense to lean in? And then related to that, any COVID costs or ongoing wage issue -- wage costs that you're contemplating, bonuses or wages, as far as maybe soaking up some of the reinvestment dollars? \nTodd Vasos: Simeon, it's Todd. I'm going to go answer your first one and then kick it over to John for the second piece.\n But the first -- your first question, our pricing is as competitive as it's been in the time that I've been here -- in 11 years that I've been here. We are in very, very good shape against all classes of trade. And again, that's one of the cornerstones, as you know, of this model and what our consumers look for, very close second, the convenient pillar. But I would tell you that right now, we don't really need to -- we don't see a need to lean in any further on price because we're so well priced today against all classes' trade. Now we will continue to watch that if something changes.\n The other thing to keep in mind is that we've been very, very vigilant around price, especially during this time. What we don't want to do is to raise prices to our consumers in a time of need, especially in a pandemic. So we've been very, very cautious about that, only raising prices on a few items as you look at milk, eggs and a few that have just rapidly increased. Others that may have increased, we've actually held prices down some, so that we are able to service the customer the way she needs to be right now. And to your point, we're doing very well and making sure we're passing some of that on to our consumers as well. \nJohn Garratt: And on the investment side, first, we continue to make meaningful investment to advance our strategic initiatives as well as remodels and new stores as we're seeing great returns as expected from those, and that continues as planned and is on track. In addition, as we go forward, health and safety of our employees and customers is our top priority. And so we will continue to invest some there as needed, making sure there's plenty of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, thorough cleaning protocols and of course, we just recently finished the installation of the plexiglass shield. So we'll do what's necessary and prudent to ensure their safety. Beyond those things, there's nothing material changes that I see right now. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then the follow-up, can you remind us the percentage of stores that are in rural areas versus, I guess, nonrural? And how did -- I guess, the dispersion or range of performance is tracking? I think it was pretty wide at first. And if that's continuing or you're seeing normalization as states begin to reopen? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. We're at right around 75% rural, very small town-based. So again, we pride ourselves on serving that underserved customer out there. I would tell you that, that footprint really serves us well, especially during this time and our customer as well. Think about being close to home, we're within 5 miles of 75% of America. You think about that small box that we offer, that 7,200 to 7,400 square foot box, she can shop that with convenience and with confidence that there won't be crowds. And then lastly, we want to make sure that as we make sure that new customers come in that we show her the best that we've got, and that's exactly what we've done through this. She's seeing great products, and we've seen great comments from our current customers as well as our new customers. So we feel that we're well positioned. Obviously, we do very well both in our rural locations and our more metro settings. But again, rural being the major driver, I would tell you, has seen a little larger increase in sales overall. But again, I'm very proud of both sides of the equation, our rural and our city-type stores. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask if I could, for a little bit of additional color on the traffic versus ticket trend in the quarter. Sorry, if I had missed that. And then also on the geographic side, if there's anything you could call out in terms of different regions of the country and how those trends may have gone. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Sure. This is Todd. I would tell you, we're very proud that both traffic and ticket were positive in the quarter. And I think that's a real testament, once again, to the power of the box that we have out there and the ability for the consumer to shop both sides of that. So again, very proud of seeing that. Obviously, the ticket side was the larger driver, but I would tell you, a very nice performance on the front side of that, too, on the traffic side.\n As far as geographics, throughout the quarter, there were some puts and takes every -- it changed depending on the severity of COVID outbreaks. So think about areas like the Northeast, think about areas like the Midwest, Michigan, Wisconsin, those type of areas. We saw big early surges, obviously in the Northeast. Things leveled out for a bit and then resurged again and it continues to be elevated. So there was some give and take. But I would tell you when all of the dust settled, all of the operating regions were very close together in their performance overall. \nMichael Montani: And just for the follow-up, if I could, was on multichannel. Just curious about the pickup efforts that you all have in place. If there's any incremental color there, maybe in terms of the pace that you might lean into it, as well as the mobile app. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Again, we're just getting going on, on our buy-online, pickup-in-the-store efforts. But I would tell you, I'll give you a couple of nuggets that we have seen early on. One is, she's been very pleased with the transaction and her ability to get what she needs. The repeat was very, very heavy, meaning once she use it once, the repeat was very good on the other side. And again, very high scores, even on our repeat. We know that the customer, as we start to move post pandemic, and we all hope we get there sooner than later, that though retail is going to change a little bit. And I would tell you those that have a strong brick-and-mortar presence as Dollar General has, but also have a very good presence of the digital side to include buy online, pickup in the store, to include areas like self-checkout, where the customer can feel that if she doesn't want to interact or have contact with another person and/or the actual payment terminals, that she can feel very confident to check out in our stores.\n I would tell you that I'm so proud of the team and their efforts over the last couple of years because they have set us up for success during this time and will flourish as we go forward. So more to come as we aggressively roll out buy online, pick up in the store in the upcoming months and quarters ahead because we know that the customer is really looking for that option inside of a brick-and-mortar retailer. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: And also congrats on a nice quarter. So I guess I wanted to start with store traffic. So it's very notable -- noticeable in your commentary just about the meaningful increase in store traffic, while many of your competitors actually had declining traffic during the quarter. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what you think is driving that delta between you and some of your peers? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. When you look at it, again, it was pretty evenly based in the regions as you look out, and backward now, in hindsight. But I would tell you that our rural locations did outperform a little bit in that area. And I think that's a real testament, again, to the rural nature of our box and the ability for customers to stay close to home and shop with confidence in a small box that doesn't have a lot of customers at any given time. I also would tell you that I think once they got in for the first time, she repeated those purchases as she continued to restock her pantries throughout the quarter. So once she got in, I think she really liked what she saw. And I would tell you, I think we did some of the best, if not the best, in keeping in-stock on many of the core items. We got a lot of customer complaints in -- on not being in-stock on some items, but they were paled in comparison to the compliments that we got in saying things like, \"We found stuff that we haven't found in other places in weeks and/or months.\" And that was great to hear. So I think just the combination of that strong box, and our rural location really helped propel those traffic numbers. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question just on the supply chain out of stock. So your inventory was down, I think, more than 5% on a same-store basis. How long do you think -- or when do you think your supply chain will be back to where it needs to be in terms of getting the stores fully stocked? \nJeffery Owen: Well, first of all -- this is Jeff. I'm extremely proud of the way the team responded to the in-stock challenges that all retailers faced. And our merchant team was involved very, very early with our suppliers in partnering with ways to get our fair share of product, but also thinking about creative ways to provide alternative pack sizes or substitute items for our stores. And then also, we were able to stand up even new SKUs during this period of time. So merchant team did an outstanding job and then the supply chain, obviously, you can't do that without the supply chain. So they were able to flex up to our demand. And then also, they're able to deliver the product to our stores on time. And then finally, as Todd mentioned as well, Fast Track earlier is -- was one of our initiatives that really paid off during this because the stores were able to get the product on the shelf.\n As I think out and when it will end, a lot of that depends on the customer. And it also depends on the way the economy in terms of the shelter in place. So as you know, many of the nation is opened up for business now, so we'll have to wait and see. But I can tell you this, our supply chain is ready to deliver the product to the stores when it's available, and our store teams are ready to get it on the shelf. So we'll be in a great position for the customer once the products are available. \nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I wanted to actually go back to a couple of comments you made in terms of the Fresh. You talked about a meaningful increase in Fresh at the stores that you've rolled the Fresh out to. So wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that.\n My second question is just on the DG Pickup. I don't know if there's any color you can provide on what the average ticket looks like. And then I had one other follow-up. \nTodd Vasos: Sure, Karen. Yes, on DG Fresh, I would tell you that we saw a meaningful difference in our in-stock levels, but also, of course, our sales numbers in the stores that we self-distributed. That's exactly what we're going to see for the long-term here. But it was even more amplified, obviously, during COVID-19 and -- when customers were out and still out looking to fill their pantries or refrigerators and freezers with goods instead of going out to eat. And so I believe that it's reacting exactly what we -- how we thought it would. But it was great to see it actually in person and an action as we -- as our customers needed it the most. So I would say that it gives us even greater confidence that as we continue to move over the next upcoming quarters and years ahead, that this is really going to pay a big dividend for us. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then in terms of the average ticket with Pickup, is there any meaningful delta or anything to point to that? I know it's still early stage. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. It is still early stage, but I would tell you that the average basket is not dissimilar to what we would normally see inside of a store, which we thought, right? So 5 to 6 items could be 7 or 8, but let's call it, 5 to 8 in total, but closer to that 6 range, with the basket size being a little larger from a dollar amount, but not meaningful. And again, it's doing exactly what we thought it would do. I don't believe our core customer is going to change her shopping behavior over the long term. I still fully believe that when she comes in, she comes in often and buys 5 to 8 items with a ring of about $12 to $13 basket sizes. And we believe that buy online, pickup in the store will be no different. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then SNAP recently increased pretty meaningfully, and I think it was about a 40% increase in monthly SNAP benefits. I guess the question is, how sustainable -- well, first of all, did you see that impact in terms of May on sales? And how sustainable do you think that will be in terms of the benefit to the comp? Because obviously, this is similar to an '08, '09 increase in terms of percentage. \nJohn Garratt: Karen, this is John. We have seen a benefit from that. As you know, recent legislation has let states make it easier for families to continue participating, has provided emergency supplemental benefits. I think it's up to 2 months as it stands now. And then also, in lieu of the National School Lunch Program, is providing $20.58 -- $20.50 per week per dependent. So the combination of those is helping our customer, and we are seeing enhanced purchasing power and increased EBT sales. So how long that persists, it depends on how long these benefits persist. But what I would tell you is, we have been growing our share with these customers over time as we serve them well, growing EBT share. And we're focused on controlling what we can control, and that's taking care of them, and we'll see how it plays out in terms of the duration of the legislation. But we are seeing the benefit. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. \nChandni Luthra: Great quarter. Just wondering as we go forward, do you see potential to be more aggressive in certain initiatives like private label and DG Fresh in this challenged environment? Is there opportunity to do more produce in those stores? You mentioned meaningful investments in your initiatives. Just want to clarify, is this an acceleration in your investments versus when you last spoke about them during 4Q? And is there an opportunity to double down on some of these initiatives in this challenged backdrop? \nTodd Vasos: Thank you. That's a great question. The numbers that John alluded to, they weren't a very big acceleration, but I would tell you, the one area that we're -- we have accelerated our thinking, as well as our expenditure has been around buy online, pick up in the store. We thought it would be a more gradual rollout. But again, seeing what we have seen now through COVID-19 and what our customers are telling us about wanting an option, if she wants to take advantage of it in that contactless world, I would tell you that buy online, pickup in the store has accelerated and our spending against it as well as the rollout into our stores will be vastly different than what we had thought. And our hope would be we would roll out the majority of the chain by the end of this year as we roll forward.\n As you look at the other area that we would anticipate, maybe expanding a little bit faster will be our self-checkout. It would be our goal eventually to help self-checkout in virtually all of our stores. It was going to be a few year rollout. We believe we can accelerate that some as we continue to move forward in 2020, but also accelerate it in '21, for sure, as again, the consumer is looking for more of a contactless experience in some cases.\n So those are just a couple, but we're taking a look at DG Fresh as well. We have a very aggressive plan there, as you already know. But the produce side is a great question, and we continue to evaluate our stores to put produce in. And that very well could be an expansion as we move through later this year and into '21 as well. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call.\n These are certainly unprecedented times for us all, and our hearts go out to the communities and individuals affected by the COVID-19 crisis. On behalf of Dollar General, I want to express our deepest gratitude to those serving on the front lines and especially to our teammates for their dedicated and efforts in fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient, and close-to-home access to essential items at a time when our customers need them most. I'm inspired by the phenomenal work our associates are doing and could not be more proud of how they've responded to the needs of our communities. In recognition of the essential work performed by our employees in April, the New York Stock Exchange recognized one of our store managers, Crystal Burroughs, during the #Gratitude campaign, where the exchange join millions of others in honoring the way people on the front lines have responded to the COVID-19 crisis.\n As one of America's essential retailers, we are committed to being part of the solution during these difficult times, and are continuing to support these efforts through our expansive network of more than 16,000 store locations currently located within 5 miles of more than 75% of the U.S. population. Our convenient small box format, providing for a quick in-and-out access and limited crowds, both of which are conducive to social distancing. Our broad assortment of everyday household essential items, our ongoing commitment to everyday low prices, our flexible supply chain, our growing digital capabilities and recent measures taking to further safeguard the well-being of both our team members and customers and of course, our talented and committed associates.\n For more than 80 years, Dollar General has served customers through a unique combination of value and convenience, and we will continue to be there for them in both good and challenging times.\n Let me now highlight some of the key actions we've taken in response to COVID-19 with 2 key priorities in mind. First is the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities we serve. Second is maintaining the continuity of our business and operations.\n For our employees and customers, we took swift and proactive action to keep them safe, while keeping stores open and running with minimal disruption. We closed 1 hour early to allow greater time for stocking and enhanced cleaning protocols, distributed masks and gloves to all employees, implemented social distancing measures in our stores, distribution centers and at-the-store support center, and completed the installation of nearly 40,000 plexiglass barriers at checkout across the entire chain. To further support heightened demand, we have hired over 50,000 people since mid-March, nearly double our normal hiring rate. We are happy to welcome these new employees to our team, and our hiring efforts are continuing. We also invested approximately $60 million in employee appreciation bonuses and provided enhanced benefits and resources, including expanded paid leave and greater access to telehealth services. And we contributed to our employee assistance foundation to assist our coworkers during times of need. All these actions have helped to ensure the continuity of our business at a time when customers need us most.\n To support our communities, we dedicated the first hour of each day to seniors and provided a discount for first responders, medical personnel and National Guard members. And through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, Save the Children, an organization working to ensure children in rural America continue to learn and have access to nutritious food during nationwide school closures, will receive a $2 million donation.\n Beyond these actions, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to further meet the evolving needs of our customers and better position Dollar General to emerge from this crisis even stronger than before.\n Turning now to our first quarter performance. The quarter was highlighted by extraordinary growth in both top and bottom lines. These results reflect significant changes in shopping patterns, which began in March as consumers reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the month of February, same-store sales increased 5.5%, driven by broad-based performance across many fronts, which we believe speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum of the underlying business.\n Beginning in March, we experienced a significant surge in demand and sales as consumers began to stock up, and category mix shifted even more than usual to our consumable category. For the month in total, comp sales increased 34.5%. April sales moderated in comparison to March, but remained elevated as consumers continue to replenish household essentials at a rate greater than normal. During April, we also experienced significant growth in our nonconsumable businesses. And our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a combined comp sales increase in excess of our consumable business. For the month in total, same-store sales increased 21.5%. Overall, first quarter net sales increased 27.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by comp sales growth of 21.7%, including significant growth in average basket size and a meaningful increase in customer traffic.\n Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data. Importantly, our data suggests a meaningful increase in new customers, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition.\n We're particularly pleased that we delivered a significant operating margin expansion this quarter, which contributed to diluted EPS of $2.56, an increase of 73% over prior year. Collectively, these results reflect our commitment to doing everything we can to support our employees, customers and communities during this time and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and having established an even stronger bond with the existing customers during these unprecedented times. Combined with the actions we've taken to forge new customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth, even in what's expected to be a challenging economic environment.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Thank you, Jeff. As I've shared with you over the past several quarters, we're investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further support long-term sustainable growth. Importantly, as a result of our efforts and investments to date, we believe we are even better positioned to move quickly alongside our customers as we continue to meet their rapidly evolving needs, further accelerated by COVID-19.\n Let me take you through some of the most recent highlights, starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of the quarter, and we plan to expand the offering to a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of 2020. We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance our NCI stores delivered in the quarter. We also continue to realize meaningful benefits from incorporating select NCI products and planograms throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions to all of our overall first quarter results. These results reinforce our belief that NCI will continue to be a meaningful sales and margin driver as we move forward, and gives us confidence in our rollout plans for 2020.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, the preliminary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items by removing the markup paid to third-party distributors, thereby enhancing gross margin, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing. Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories by enabling the accelerated rollout of our high capacity coolers, increasing in-stock levels and eventually expanding our overall assortment offering. Importantly, we are already seeing evidence of success against these goals, including meaningful increase in perishable sales and higher overall in-stock levels in stores being serviced by DG Fresh. In total, we are now self-distributing to more than 9,000 stores from 6 DG Fresh facilities. Our goal for 2020 is to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 12,000 stores from up to 10 facilities, including our first combination facility co-located with our existing dry goods distribution center in Zanesville, Ohio.\n We continue to believe this initiative will be accretive to operating margin in 2020, as the benefits begin to exceed associated expenses and growing in the years ahead as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.\n Turning to our digital initiative, where our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to providing our core customer with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. We believe essential brick-and-mortar retailers continue to serve a critical role, and that has never been more evident than in the past few months. We believe our unique store footprint, combined with our digital efforts, have positioned us well in a challenging and changing retail landscape, particularly as we consider the possibilities in a post COVID-19 environment.\n More specifically, DG Pickup, which is our buy online and pickup-in-the-store offering, provides an important access point for those seeking a more contactless customer experience. We launched a pilot of this solution at the end of Q4 and are very pleased with the initial results, including positive feedback from both customers and employees. Importantly, we are well positioned to scale quickly with plans for rapid expansion as we move ahead. Beyond DG Pickup, DG GO! mobile checkout is currently available in approximately 750 stores, with plans to further expand as we look to combine this feature with self-checkout, providing an even more convenient and contactless checkout solution.\n Moving now to Fast Track, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We are pleased with the store labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a results of our efforts around rolltainer optimization and even more shelf-ready packaging. These improvements are particularly notable in the quarter as our teams work diligently and efficiently to keep products on the shelf. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which represents added flexibility for consumers who may seek to limit face-to-face interaction, while also driving greater efficiencies in the store for our associates. Self-checkout is currently available in more than 30 stores, and our plans consist of a broader rollout later this year as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition.\n Overall, we continue to make great progress with our strategic initiatives, while advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives as we are constantly evaluating what lies ahead for our customers and our business. We continue to believe we are pursuing the right strategies to capture additional growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.\n In closing, we are proud of our strong start to 2020. Our results are a testament to the strong execution and disciplined approach of our team. And with our unique combination of value and convenience, further enhanced through our initiatives, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment and come out the other side stronger together with the communities we serve. Importantly, we are very proud of our people, specifically those serving on the front lines, including our store associates, distribution center employees and those in our private fleet. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 155,000 employees across the company for their tireless commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. Yes, Michael, it's Todd. Thank you. Yes, we have seen an increase in customers. And no surprise, right? When the going gets tough, we know that our customers need us more and we're there for them. But we also know from past recessionary times that -- and in times of these, that we have a customer that also starts to trade into Dollar General. We saw that in a very big way in Q1. We can validate that pretty easily through credit card data that we've seen, but also through, as you know, we do extensive quarterly customer interactions and reach-outs. And we know exactly where our customers stand as well as new customers. And I would tell you, those reach-outs to our customers have told us this quarter that not only did we trade in, we loved what we saw, and we plan to repeat shop, if they haven't already. So we're very, very bullish on that. And I think it's a real testament to the work the team has done on this box to make it the most relevant it's been in many, many years. And I would tell you that just like we probably saw in '08, '09, with new customers coming in, they're delighted to see all the changes that we've made. And just like that, I'm very bullish that we'll continue to hold on to those customers for the long term. Yes, Michael. Thank you. The customer was feeling very good. I think it was a real testament. She was back to work leading into this crisis. So when you look at our strong comp in the month of February, which really had virtually no COVID-related retail in it, she was very, very -- in a very good shape, probably the best we've seen in many, many years. What that was a -- what that enabled her to be able to do was to stock up with confidence, and we saw that early on. She came in and really stocked up first, starting like with paper goods and moving into food. And then obviously, once stimulus started to rollout, we saw, obviously, like other retailers, a surge in our discretionary type categories.\n Right now, what I would tell you, because we do talk to her very frequently, as I mentioned earlier, she has a lot more trepidation, obviously, just because of what's going on. But I would tell you that she still has money in her pocket. It's evidenced by what she's doing. But I think a lot of that extra money right now is driven by stimulus, both the basic stimulus that was sent out starting middle of April. But also for perhaps any unemployment that may be needed for our core customer which, by the way, there's evidence to show maybe our core customer is not having to capitalize yet on that because they're most likely frontline workers like many of America's customers today out there. And so she's got a lot of money still in her pocket. But we're watching it very, very closely because that can turn, and we understand that, and we're watching it. But we also are watching when stimulus starts to taper off. And of course, with additional snap benefits that are out there, that's helping as well. So when you put it all together, we feel that we're very well positioned.\n The sweet spot, I would tell you, we do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times. But I would rather see our core consumer, they have money in her pocket and be able to spend equally on both our consumable and nonconsumable businesses. But we're very, very bullish on what post-COVID looks like because, again, I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall. Simeon, it's Todd. I'm going to go answer your first one and then kick it over to John for the second piece.\n But the first -- your first question, our pricing is as competitive as it's been in the time that I've been here -- in 11 years that I've been here. We are in very, very good shape against all classes of trade. And again, that's one of the cornerstones, as you know, of this model and what our consumers look for, very close second, the convenient pillar. But I would tell you that right now, we don't really need to -- we don't see a need to lean in any further on price because we're so well priced today against all classes' trade. Now we will continue to watch that if something changes.\n The other thing to keep in mind is that we've been very, very vigilant around price, especially during this time. What we don't want to do is to raise prices to our consumers in a time of need, especially in a pandemic. So we've been very, very cautious about that, only raising prices on a few items as you look at milk, eggs and a few that have just rapidly increased. Others that may have increased, we've actually held prices down some, so that we are able to service the customer the way she needs to be right now. And to your point, we're doing very well and making sure we're passing some of that on to our consumers as well. Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. We're at right around 75% rural, very small town-based. So again, we pride ourselves on serving that underserved customer out there. I would tell you that, that footprint really serves us well, especially during this time and our customer as well. Think about being close to home, we're within 5 miles of 75% of America. You think about that small box that we offer, that 7,200 to 7,400 square foot box, she can shop that with convenience and with confidence that there won't be crowds. And then lastly, we want to make sure that as we make sure that new customers come in that we show her the best that we've got, and that's exactly what we've done through this. She's seeing great products, and we've seen great comments from our current customers as well as our new customers. So we feel that we're well positioned. Obviously, we do very well both in our rural locations and our more metro settings. But again, rural being the major driver, I would tell you, has seen a little larger increase in sales overall. But again, I'm very proud of both sides of the equation, our rural and our city-type stores. Yes. Sure. This is Todd. I would tell you, we're very proud that both traffic and ticket were positive in the quarter. And I think that's a real testament, once again, to the power of the box that we have out there and the ability for the consumer to shop both sides of that. So again, very proud of seeing that. Obviously, the ticket side was the larger driver, but I would tell you, a very nice performance on the front side of that, too, on the traffic side.\n As far as geographics, throughout the quarter, there were some puts and takes every -- it changed depending on the severity of COVID outbreaks. So think about areas like the Northeast, think about areas like the Midwest, Michigan, Wisconsin, those type of areas. We saw big early surges, obviously in the Northeast. Things leveled out for a bit and then resurged again and it continues to be elevated. So there was some give and take. But I would tell you when all of the dust settled, all of the operating regions were very close together in their performance overall. Yes. Again, we're just getting going on, on our buy-online, pickup-in-the-store efforts. But I would tell you, I'll give you a couple of nuggets that we have seen early on. One is, she's been very pleased with the transaction and her ability to get what she needs. The repeat was very, very heavy, meaning once she use it once, the repeat was very good on the other side. And again, very high scores, even on our repeat. We know that the customer, as we start to move post pandemic, and we all hope we get there sooner than later, that though retail is going to change a little bit. And I would tell you those that have a strong brick-and-mortar presence as Dollar General has, but also have a very good presence of the digital side to include buy online, pickup in the store, to include areas like self-checkout, where the customer can feel that if she doesn't want to interact or have contact with another person and/or the actual payment terminals, that she can feel very confident to check out in our stores.\n I would tell you that I'm so proud of the team and their efforts over the last couple of years because they have set us up for success during this time and will flourish as we go forward. So more to come as we aggressively roll out buy online, pick up in the store in the upcoming months and quarters ahead because we know that the customer is really looking for that option inside of a brick-and-mortar retailer. Yes. When you look at it, again, it was pretty evenly based in the regions as you look out, and backward now, in hindsight. But I would tell you that our rural locations did outperform a little bit in that area. And I think that's a real testament, again, to the rural nature of our box and the ability for customers to stay close to home and shop with confidence in a small box that doesn't have a lot of customers at any given time. I also would tell you that I think once they got in for the first time, she repeated those purchases as she continued to restock her pantries throughout the quarter. So once she got in, I think she really liked what she saw. And I would tell you, I think we did some of the best, if not the best, in keeping in-stock on many of the core items. We got a lot of customer complaints in -- on not being in-stock on some items, but they were paled in comparison to the compliments that we got in saying things like, \"We found stuff that we haven't found in other places in weeks and/or months.\" And that was great to hear. So I think just the combination of that strong box, and our rural location really helped propel those traffic numbers. Sure, Karen. Yes, on DG Fresh, I would tell you that we saw a meaningful difference in our in-stock levels, but also, of course, our sales numbers in the stores that we self-distributed. That's exactly what we're going to see for the long-term here. But it was even more amplified, obviously, during COVID-19 and -- when customers were out and still out looking to fill their pantries or refrigerators and freezers with goods instead of going out to eat. And so I believe that it's reacting exactly what we -- how we thought it would. But it was great to see it actually in person and an action as we -- as our customers needed it the most. So I would say that it gives us even greater confidence that as we continue to move over the next upcoming quarters and years ahead, that this is really going to pay a big dividend for us. Yes. It is still early stage, but I would tell you that the average basket is not dissimilar to what we would normally see inside of a store, which we thought, right? So 5 to 6 items could be 7 or 8, but let's call it, 5 to 8 in total, but closer to that 6 range, with the basket size being a little larger from a dollar amount, but not meaningful. And again, it's doing exactly what we thought it would do. I don't believe our core customer is going to change her shopping behavior over the long term. I still fully believe that when she comes in, she comes in often and buys 5 to 8 items with a ring of about $12 to $13 basket sizes. And we believe that buy online, pickup in the store will be no different. Thank you. That's a great question. The numbers that John alluded to, they weren't a very big acceleration, but I would tell you, the one area that we're -- we have accelerated our thinking, as well as our expenditure has been around buy online, pick up in the store. We thought it would be a more gradual rollout. But again, seeing what we have seen now through COVID-19 and what our customers are telling us about wanting an option, if she wants to take advantage of it in that contactless world, I would tell you that buy online, pickup in the store has accelerated and our spending against it as well as the rollout into our stores will be vastly different than what we had thought. And our hope would be we would roll out the majority of the chain by the end of this year as we roll forward.\n As you look at the other area that we would anticipate, maybe expanding a little bit faster will be our self-checkout. It would be our goal eventually to help self-checkout in virtually all of our stores. It was going to be a few year rollout. We believe we can accelerate that some as we continue to move forward in 2020, but also accelerate it in '21, for sure, as again, the consumer is looking for more of a contactless experience in some cases.\n So those are just a couple, but we're taking a look at DG Fresh as well. We have a very aggressive plan there, as you already know. But the produce side is a great question, and we continue to evaluate our stores to put produce in. And that very well could be an expansion as we move through later this year and into '21 as well."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to echo Todd's gratitude to our employees and note that my thoughts are with those who've been impacted by this crisis.\n Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the first quarter, let me take you through some of the financial details. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year and all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 30.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 49 basis points. The gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution costs, which were driven by increased volume and our decision to incur discretionary bonus expense.\n SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 20.5%, a decrease of 204 basis points. Although we incurred certain incremental costs related to COVID-19, these costs were more than offset by the significant increase in sales. Expenses that were lower as a percentage of net sales this quarter include: Occupancy costs, retail labor, utilities, depreciation and amortization and taxes and licenses. These items were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 69.2% to $867 million compared to $512 million in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 10.3%, an increase of 253 basis points. We believe the impact of COVID-19 significantly benefited operating profit in Q1, primarily through higher sales, partially offset by approximately $80 million of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $60 million in appreciation bonuses and nearly $20 million in measures taken to further protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as enhanced benefits programs to support our store associates, distribution center employees and private fleet drivers.\n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 20.8% in the first quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted earlier, EPS for the first quarter increased 73% to $2.56.\n Turning now to our cash flow and balance sheet, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to better support our customers, employees during these difficult times. The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter, totaling $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion or 202%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance, combined with lower levels of inventory as we continue to work closely with suppliers to improve in-stocks for high-demand products. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, essentially flat to prior year and a decrease of 5.5% on a per-store basis. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter were $195 million, and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $63 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $91 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.1 billion. In light of the COVID-19 uncertainty, and out of an abundance of caution, we proactively took steps during the quarter to further bolster our already strong liquidity position, including the temporary suspension of share repurchases and the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes on April 3. These measures, along with our strong cash flow, put us in an even stronger liquidity position with $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility at the end of Q1.\n Importantly, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases when it is prudent to do so and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2020. Let me start by acknowledging the inherent and significant uncertainty that continues to exist around the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. In addition, the timing, scope and impact of both current and anticipated stimulus legislation and other governmental responses to the pandemic remains to be seen. As a result, it is difficult to predict specific outcomes. And while we expect to exceed our prior guidance for fiscal 2020 net sales, same-store sales and EPS, we are unable to estimate the extent of such upside with reasonable accuracy.  Accordingly, we are withdrawing our sales, earnings and share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2020 that was issued on March 12, 2020, in conjunction with our Q4 earnings call. With regards to share repurchases, we are constantly evaluating our position and intend to resume our share buyback activity when it is prudent and advisable to do so, which may be as early as the 2020 second quarter. Finally, our 2020 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we issued in our Q4 earnings release on March 12, 2020.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends, thus far, in May. Since the end of Q1 and through May 26, we have continued to experience elevated consumer demand in our stores, albeit with some intermittent moderation and in particular, over some of the more recent days. Overall, same-store sales have increased by approximately 22% during this time frame. That said, it is important to note that there are a number of factors which suggest that sales will moderate to more normalized levels beginning during the latter part of Q2, including the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the gradual reopening of other retailers, the tapering of benefits included in recent stimulus legislation and managing through what is likely to be a more challenging economic environment for our consumers.\n With regards to our strategic initiatives, we continue to anticipate they will positively contribute to gross profit rate this year, specifically our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI and DG Fresh. In addition, we also expect continued and meaningful investment in our initiatives this year, including ongoing expenses associated with each. We continue to believe these investments will improve operating margin over time, particularly as the benefits to gross margin continue to scale and ultimately outpace the associated expense with both NCI and DG Fresh expected to be accretive to operating margin in 2020. However, these investments will continue to pressure SG&A rates this year as we accelerate their rollouts.\n In closing, I want to reiterate that we are very proud of the team's execution and service during the quarter. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you, Michael. This is John. And providing a little more context here, we alluded to in the prepared comments that through Q1, through May 26, our same-store sales have increased by 22% during this time frame and had mentioned some intermittent moderation over recent days. Given the unprecedented environment and the spirit of transparency, I do think it's fair to give more color on the recent trends. What we've seen in some recent days is some days in the mid-teens, but we've seen it bounce back in recent days into the mid-20s. So things have been fluid, but sales are still very healthy and we believe we're very well positioned. We're seeing strength in both sides of the box on the consumables side and the nonconsumables. And I think an interesting stat we've seen floating around is just how much people have their stimulus money still deposited in the banks, which leads you to believe there's some tail to that. But we're still seeing strength in both sides of the business and believe with our unique combination of value and convenience, we're very well positioned. Thanks, Matthew. I'll walk you through the puts and takes. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the Q1 gross margin expansion of 49 basis points. One of the things we didn't call out as a driver was product mix, not a material impact on margin pressure. That really speaks to the surge we saw in nonconsumables, particularly as the stimulus payments came out. That, coupled with the mix within the mix, within consumables, we saw strength in categories like health and beauty, which has margin rates more akin to nonconsumables. So the combination of those helped balance out the mix pressure from the initial surge in consumables and made it really not a material impact for Q1.\n What we did see driving benefit in Q1 is what we have been seeing and calling out in recent quarters. One was lower markdowns as a percentage of net sales was the top one. The team remains very targeted on their promotional spending. And then the second one we called out was initial markups on inventory purchases, and that's really DG Fresh. We are seeing the substantial cost benefit we expected to see as we self-distribute frozen refrigerated goods and seeing a growing benefit from NCI as well. So while it's hard to get very specific around Q2 or the following quarters given the dynamics -- the near-term dynamics, what I would say is that we continue to see opportunities to continue increasing our margins over time with the growing benefit of initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. And the other levers we have, the team continues to do a fabulous job with category management. Private brands, where we've seen elevated sales in recent quarters, and there's a big opportunity in foreign sourcing.\n Supply chain, you asked specifically around supply chain. Obviously, there's a little bit of geography there as we take over self-distribution of frozen refrigerated goods. We take on a little bit more cost there, but we save a lot more on the product cost side. But when you strip that out, it's been doing very well driving efficiencies as the team has been working on reducing transportation rates where they've been successful as we've expanded and diversified our carrier base, expanded our private fleet. We're seeing lower fuel costs and they continue to do an excellent job driving efficiencies through stem mile reduction, load optimization and DC productivity efforts.\n And then the other one that we didn't really call out this quarter because it wasn't material with shrink, we continue to see an opportunity for shrink over the long term. We're looking forward to the latter part of the year as we see the benefit -- hope to see the benefit of the EAS units, the 6,000 units we installed, completing the chain at the end of last year, looking to see the continued benefit we've seen in the past from those, as well as increased tagging now that we've completed the system.\n So I think when you put all those together, we feel very well positioned. Now we always reserve the right to invest in price if needed. But we believe we're in a great position right now with price, and believe we're making the right investments to drive margin expansion over the long-term and believe we have the levers to do so. And on the investment side, first, we continue to make meaningful investment to advance our strategic initiatives as well as remodels and new stores as we're seeing great returns as expected from those, and that continues as planned and is on track. In addition, as we go forward, health and safety of our employees and customers is our top priority. And so we will continue to invest some there as needed, making sure there's plenty of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, thorough cleaning protocols and of course, we just recently finished the installation of the plexiglass shield. So we'll do what's necessary and prudent to ensure their safety. Beyond those things, there's nothing material changes that I see right now. Karen, this is John. We have seen a benefit from that. As you know, recent legislation has let states make it easier for families to continue participating, has provided emergency supplemental benefits. I think it's up to 2 months as it stands now. And then also, in lieu of the National School Lunch Program, is providing $20.58 -- $20.50 per week per dependent. So the combination of those is helping our customer, and we are seeing enhanced purchasing power and increased EBT sales. So how long that persists, it depends on how long these benefits persist. But what I would tell you is, we have been growing our share with these customers over time as we serve them well, growing EBT share. And we're focused on controlling what we can control, and that's taking care of them, and we'll see how it plays out in terms of the duration of the legislation. But we are seeing the benefit."

            "content": "Thank you, John. I'd like to start by also thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication as we navigate this difficult time. I want to take the few -- next few minutes to update you on our 4 operating priorities.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did an outstanding job this quarter executing against a portfolio of growth initiatives despite the challenges surrounding COVID-19. Let me highlight some of our recent efforts.\n Starting with our cooler door expansion, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we installed more than 15,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 55,000 cooler doors in 2020, the majority of which will be in our higher capacity coolers as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.\n Turning now to private brands, which continues to be a priority as we pursue opportunities to deliver even greater value for our customers, while also driving profitable sales growth. During the quarter, we made great progress with our rebranding and repositioning efforts, including the relaunch of our laundry brand under the Trueliving label. In addition, our Clover Valley redesign has begun rolling out, with over 250 items now available and more to come as we seek to drive greater category awareness and even higher customer adoption.\n Moving to our Better For You offering, which is especially important during a time when more food is being consumed at home. This offering is now available in approximately 6,000 stores, with plans to expand to nearly 7,000 stores by year-end.\n Finally, a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This service is currently available in approximately 4,800 locations, with plans to expand to over 8,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our strategy of leveraging our unique real estate footprint to increase customer access to services in convenient and nearby locations.\n Beyond these sales-driving initiatives, enhancing gross margin remains a critical area of focus for us. In addition to some of our strategic initiatives, which Todd will discuss later, as well as our private brand efforts, foreign sourcing remains an important gross margin opportunity for us. Our efforts this quarter were focused on supporting the business in a rapidly changing global environment. The team did a tremendous job of working closely with each of our supply partners to ensure product availability, including pursuing product substitutions and shifting production to other countries when warranted. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant opportunity to increase our foreign sourcing penetration, while also further diversifying our countries of origin as we seek to provide even greater value and an enhanced assortment offering for our customers.\n We also continue to pursue supply chain efficiencies through the further reduction of stem miles and continued expansion of our private fleet. We're especially proud of the team's efforts during the quarter as we delivered against record volumes, while constantly working with our vendor partners to minimize disruptions to supply. We are also executing against additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including further improvements in shrink and to our category management process.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of the business and enhances our ability to bring value and convenience to even more customers across the country. As one of America's essential retailers, we're committed to providing customers with even greater access to essential goods, especially during these unprecedented times. To that end, in the first quarter, we opened 250 new stores, remodeled 481 stores, including 332 in the higher cooler count, DGTP or DGP formats and relocated 17 stores. We also expanded the number of stores offering fresh produce, bringing the total [indiscernible] produce to approximately 750. And despite the added complexities as a result of COVID-19, our best-in-class real estate team has worked diligently with our communities and business partners to keep our real estate plans on track for 2020. As a result, we are maintaining our real estate outlook for the year as we plan to open 1,000 new stores, remodel 1,500 new store -- excuse me, 1,500 stores, and relocate 80 stores, representing nearly 2,600 real estate projects in total. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's continued ability to execute such high volumes of real estate projects, which is a testament to their dedication to serving new and existing customers.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This save-to-serve approach has served us well in navigating the current environment, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our ongoing efforts to further supply our -- to simplify our operations have been an important factor in eliminating unnecessary tasks. In turn, this has allowed for our store associates to better serve our customers during this period of heightened demand. Beyond enhancing our ability to serve, this process has also generated significant savings across the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. The strength and dedication of our people was on full display during the quarter as we heard countless stories of our frontline employees going above and beyond the call of duty to serve our customers and communities. As Todd noted earlier, we made a significant investment of approximately $60 million in employee bonuses to demonstrate continued appreciation for their exceptional efforts to serve our customers and fulfill the company's mission of serving others. We believe these bonuses, as well as our other investments and benefits, such as additional paid leave, were well received. In fact, we continue to see record low turnover at the store manager level, as well as lower turnover across our associate base. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our strong applicant flows, as evidenced by the hiring of more than 50,000 people since mid-March. We also continue to embrace innovative approaches to training and development and have recently transitioned to a virtual training environment, resulting in the continued development of our people despite the inability to travel. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with an innovative and growing retailer is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n In summary, we are executing well from a position of strength, and these operating priorities continue to provide the foundation from which we can drive continued growth in the years ahead.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Well, first of all -- this is Jeff. I'm extremely proud of the way the team responded to the in-stock challenges that all retailers faced. And our merchant team was involved very, very early with our suppliers in partnering with ways to get our fair share of product, but also thinking about creative ways to provide alternative pack sizes or substitute items for our stores. And then also, we were able to stand up even new SKUs during this period of time. So merchant team did an outstanding job and then the supply chain, obviously, you can't do that without the supply chain. So they were able to flex up to our demand. And then also, they're able to deliver the product to our stores on time. And then finally, as Todd mentioned as well, Fast Track earlier is -- was one of our initiatives that really paid off during this because the stores were able to get the product on the shelf.\n As I think out and when it will end, a lot of that depends on the customer. And it also depends on the way the economy in terms of the shelter in place. So as you know, many of the nation is opened up for business now, so we'll have to wait and see. But I can tell you this, our supply chain is ready to deliver the product to the stores when it's available, and our store teams are ready to get it on the shelf. So we'll be in a great position for the customer once the products are available."

[Operator Instructions]  \n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the critical needs of our communities, particularly over the past 2 years of the COVID pandemic.  \n Our fourth quarter performance was impacted by sustained and rising inflation, ongoing global supply chain pressure and a surge in Omicron cases, which impacted staffing levels at our distribution centers, contributing to elevated out-of-stocks. Despite these challenging conditions, our teams continued to focus on controlling what we can control and being there for our customers.  \n Because of their efforts and great execution over the past 2 years, we believe our underlying business is even stronger than before the pandemic, which positions us well to deliver solid sales and profit growth in 2022 and beyond. And while we expect this challenging environment to persist over the near term, which is reflected in our Q1 and fiscal 2022 outlook, we're confident we are taking the appropriate actions to manage through this period and deliver on our full year plan.  \n In fact, I'm pleased to report our staffing levels are back to 2019 pre-COVID levels in both our stores and distribution centers, and we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our in-stock positions. Additionally, although we experienced higher-than-expected product and supply chain cost in Q4, we are very confident in our price position as our price indexes, relative to competitors and other classes of trade, remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges.  \n And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important to our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment is $1 or less. And moving forward, we expect to continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, even in a challenging economic environment.  \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales increased 2.8% to $8.7 billion, following a 17.6% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales declined 1.4% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 11.3% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, Comp sales were lowest in January, with December being our strongest month of performance.  \n Our fourth quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size. Notably, our average basket size at year-end was approximately $16 and consisted of nearly 6 items. This compares to an average basket size of about $13 and 5 items at the end of 2019, which we believe reflects the growing impact of our strategic initiatives and a degree of inflation.  \n In addition, we are pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. And even as our market share in highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q4, we feel good about our share gains on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, which continues to exceed our initial expectations.  \n For the full year, net sales increased 1.4% to $34.2 billion, which was on the high end of our full year guidance and on top of a robust 21.6% increase in fiscal 2020. Comp sales for the year decreased 2.8%, which translates into a very healthy 13.5% increase on a 2-year stack basis.  \n In total, we completed more than 2,900 real estate projects during the year, including the opening of our 18,000th Dollar General store and 50 stand-alone pOpshelf locations as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth.  \n From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in key areas, including the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as well as our most recent initiatives focused on health and international expansion as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.  \n Overall, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results, which further validate our belief that our strategic actions and targeted investments positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And while our mission and culture remain unchanged as the foundation for our success, with our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I believe Dollar General is a much different company and is in a much stronger competitive position than it was just a few short years ago.  \n As a result, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the enormous growth opportunities we see ahead. \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and the full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q4 2020 and fiscal year 2020 were both positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% and 28%, respectively, in our combined nonconsumables categories. \n For Q4 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.2%, a decrease of 131 basis points. The decrease compared to Q4 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation and distribution costs and a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category.  \n Of note, while we expect some relief as we move through 2022, our Q4 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q4 2020, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $100 million. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales in higher inventory markups.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22% in the quarter, a decrease of 16 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by lower incremental costs related to COVID-19, lower hurricane-related expenses and a reduction in incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by certain expenses that were higher as a percentage of sales, including retail labor, occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 8.7% to $797 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.2%, a decrease of 116 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.2% and compares to 22.7% in the fourth quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% to $2.57, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% over a 2-year period.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remained strong and provided us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $5.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 7% overall and 1.4% on a per store basis. Importantly, as Todd noted, we have begun to see a meaningful improvement in our in-stock levels since the end of the year and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers with the products they want and need.  \n In 2021, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  \n During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $490 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.1 billion.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. First, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal year 2022 includes a 53rd week which will occur during the last period of the fourth quarter. We also continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding, among other things, the impacts on the business arising from the current geopolitical conflict and the recovery from the global COVID pandemic, including recovery of the U.S. economy, changes in consumer behavior, labor markets and government stimulus and assistance programs. \n Despite these uncertainties, including cost inflation, ongoing pressure in the supply chain and rising fuel costs, we are pleased to provide annual guidance that reflects our confidence in the business. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2022. \n Net sales growth of approximately 10%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5%; and EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate range of 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes the impact of increases in the cost of certain building materials as well as continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.  \n With regards to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, which represents an increase of 31%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $2.75 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our continued strong liquidity position, the benefit from the 53rd week and our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business.  \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant stimulus benefit from Q1 2021, including gross margin expansion of 208 basis points. We also anticipate ongoing cost inflation, including elevated supply chain and fuel costs. \n While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the unusual lap in the significant inflationary environment in Q1, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales decline of 1% to 2% in Q1 with an EPS in the range of approximately $2.25 to $2.35.  \n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, could drive additional benefits over the year despite continued cost pressures in the near term. Partially offsetting some of these benefits are rising fuel costs as well as an expected return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022.  \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. And we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of an expected increase in wage inflation.  \n In summary, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results in 2021, which are a testament to the perseverance and execution by the team. Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for 2022, including our outlook for sales and EPS growth as well as our planned significant returns to shareholders via an increased dividend payout and increased share repurchases.  \n As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in our business and employees for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, including our plans for 2022. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We have a growing portfolio of initiatives which are contributing to our strong results as well as strengthening the foundation for future growth. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights as well as some of our next steps. \n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 11,700 stores at the end of 2021. We continued to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across the NCI store base. Notably, NCI stores outperformed non-NCI stores in both average ticket and customer traffic, driving an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average in NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and we are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our newest store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value, with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. \n During the quarter, we opened 25 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 55 and exceeding our initial goal of 50 stores. Additionally, we opened 11 new store within a store concepts during Q4, bringing the total number of Dollar General Market stores with a smaller-footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 25 at the end of the year. And we continue to be pleased with the results. \n In 2022, we plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count and open up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts. We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. \n In addition to the early success of pOpshelf, we have been able to take some of our learnings and apply them in our Dollar General store base, particularly in further enhancing our nonconsumables offering. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multi-phased shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. \n The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Notably, DG Fresh was a meaningful positive contributor to our gross margin rate in 2021, and we expect to see continued benefits in 2022. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. In fact, our perishables department had a high single-digit comp increase in Q4 and contributed more comp sales dollars than any other department for both Q4 and the full year. Importantly, the sales penetration of these categories has increased to approximately 9% as compared to approximately 8% prior to the rollout of DG Fresh. \n In 2022, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale and deliver an even wider product selection. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of Q4, we offered produce in more than 2,100 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2021, we added more than 65,000 cooler doors across our store base. In 2022, we again expect to install more than 65,000 additional doors as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,200 stores at the end of 2021, with plans to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. As we move toward becoming more of a health destination, particularly in rural America, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2021, we completed a total of 2,902 real estate projects, including 1,050 new stores, 1,752 remodels and 100 relocations. \n For 2022, we remain on track to execute nearly 3,000 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger, 8,500 square foot store format, allowing for an expanded assortment and room to accommodate future growth as we respond to our customers' desire for an even wider product selection. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of all of our larger-format stores as average sales per square foot are about 15% above an average traditional store. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, and included in our expected new store total, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally with the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. \n Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust with more brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer in the country. And we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2021 with over 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n As with everything we do, the customer is at the center of our digital initiative. Our partnership with DoorDash is the latest example of these efforts as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 10,700 stores at the end of Q4, and we are very pleased with the early results, including our ability to generate profitable transactions as well as better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n In addition, our DG Media Network is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our brand partners with our customers. To that end, we significantly grew the reach of this network in 2021, increasing from 6 million unique active profiles to more than 75 million, enabling our vendors to now reach over 90% of our DG customers through the DG Media Network. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Notably, the Save to Serve program contributed more than $800 million in cumulative cost savings from its inception in 2015 through the end of 2021. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. \n The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 6,100 stores at the end of 2021. We continue to be pleased with our results, including strong and growing customer adoption rates and high scores on speed and ease of checkout. In 2022, we plan to expand this offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. \n Looking ahead, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders in 2022. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. \n I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 700 tractors and accounted for approximately 20% of our outbound transportation fleet at the end of 2021. We are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors, we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. \n Importantly, we save an average of 20% of associated costs every time we replace a third-party tractor with one from our private fleet. Moving forward, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control in our supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. \n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created thousands of new jobs in 2021, providing career growth opportunities for existing associates and the start of a career for many others. In 2022, we now expect to create more than 10,000 net new jobs as a result of our continued growth. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust, as evidenced by our internal placement of more than 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position. \n We also continue to innovate on development for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. These investments include offering an enhanced college tuition benefit for our associates and their families as well as continuing to facilitate driver training programs for associates who would like to become drivers in our private fleet. \n In addition to our focus on development, we continue to focus on further enhancing the associate experience and our strong workplace culture. \n Collectively, these investments continue to yield positive results across our organization, including healthy applicant flow and strong critical staffing levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we made significant progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2021. These efforts have further strengthened our foundation and position heading into 2022 as we continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. \n In closing, I'm proud of the team's strong and resilient performance in 2021. As we enter 2022, we are laser-focused on executing and delivering our robust plans, which we believe will further enhance our unique combination of value and convenience for our customers while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 163,000 employees for their tireless dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. So maybe to kick off, Todd, with a number of moving pieces between employment and inflation, could you speak to health of your low-income consumer? How do you view the opportunity to potentially take share in this environment? And just drivers of top line improvement that you see as the year progresses within your 2.5% comp guide. \nTodd Vasos: Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, I'll first start by saying, we've always said here that the health of the consumer, this low-end consumer that we serve the most here at Dollar General, is usually geared and attached to whether they're gainfully employed or not. I'm happy to say that, with the labor market the way it is, that she is gainfully employed, working as many hours as she would like to right now. Matter of fact, we believe that approximately $1.20 increase year-over-year in her wages are in her wallet. So that is a significant amount. \n Now to your point, there are some other things, other headwinds here that we watch out for. Obviously, inflation has definitely taken a toll on some of that additional wage growth that she's seen. And then recently, over the last couple of weeks, gas prices are up $0.70 a gallon. So that -- we watch that very carefully. \n Now we always also said that once that gas price reaches over $4 a gallon, which it has now, that we normally see the consumers stay closer to home, which bodes very well for that value and convenient message that we have out there for our core consumer and that we deliver every day. That value and convenient message reigns supreme at the end of the day across the company here at Dollar General and with our core customer. \n So again, as you think about it, tougher times for the consumer normally means that she needs us more, and we normally start to see a trade-down once that occurs and we'll be watching out for that. Again, that value and convenience really attracts that trade-in, trade-down customer. \n As far as the drivers of what we believe. Well, our initiatives, Matt, as you know, have been very, very successful over the last 6 to 7 years here at Dollar General. And they're the cornerstone of why we feel confident in our guide for 2022. Obviously a lot of year ahead of us, but those initiatives are truly the cornerstone of that. \n But then when you think again about that value and convenience message we have, if the market gets a little tighter from a labor perspective or inflation continues to pull more money out of the consumer's wallet, we feel that we're very well positioned as we move through '22 as well. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe, John, as a follow-up on gross margin, just to dig a bit deeper. I guess what level of runway remains with DG Fresh in terms of the gross margin opportunity from here? Are you seeing anything in pricing and the promotional landscape as we think about your assumption for markdowns to return to historical levels? \n And then just last, the net of distribution and transportation efficiencies relative to fuel costs, is that a net headwind, tailwind, neutral? Just kind of trying to size those 3 up in terms of a net for the year. \nJohn Garratt: Sure. Sure. So a lot of pieces there. I'll try and attack all those as I kind of walk through the puts and takes of gross margins. I'll start by saying we're really pleased with what we've done with gross margin in recent years. As you look at 2021, it's up about 100 basis over 2019 levels. \n Now we didn't give specific margin -- gross margin guidance for 2022, but we did mention that Q1 in particular would be pressured as we're lapping a pretty significant expansion last year of 208 basis points that certainly benefited from favorable mix fueled by stimulus. In addition to that tough lap, we have cost inflation continuing in Q1, which is driven by supply chain, fuel and product costs, and to a lesser extent, a return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink. Still lower than the pandemic levels, but normalizing a little bit. \n So certainly, there's some near-term pressures persisting in Q1 in the first part of the year. But bear in mind, as we move through the year, the lap gets easier in the second half as we're lapping the heavy inflation from this year. \n And just as a frame of reference, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points of added pressure to gross margin from the combination of supply chain, which was about $100 million incremental year-over-year impact; and the LIFO provision, which was $72 million. We don't see this as structural. We anticipate some moderation in cost pressures. We're already seeing this in transportation, supply chain, for instance. \n Plus, when you look at the benefits of the initiatives and the cost-reduction actions we have in place, we see a growing benefit from that. For instance, if you look at private fleet, we mentioned we're going to double that in size from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022. That drives, as Jeff mentioned, about 20% savings each time we switch from a third-party carrier to in-house. And of course, we have the growing benefit of the initiatives that Todd mentioned, which not only helped the top line but the bottom line when you think of DG Fresh, NCI and pOpshelf. \n And there's still -- to your other question, there's still a lot of runway there. As we continue to optimize DG Fresh, get the leverage from that now that we can negotiate directly on that and we're top 3 vendors -- or customers, in many cases. NCI, we'll continue the rollout of that and virtually complete that this year. And then you have the growing benefit of pOpshelf, which we mentioned comes out of the ground with margins north of 40% and should only grow from there as we get scale. And we've talked about all the other levers we have. And then not to mention just our ability to leverage our scale as a limited SKU operator. \n So we've contemplated all this in the EPS guidance, which we feel very good about. While there's some near-term pressures, especially in the early part of the year, we feel great about the initiatives, the other levers we have. And we still believe we can expand gross margin over the long term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: So I wanted to just talk a little bit about the longer-term algorithm and relationship between sales growth and EBIT. So when I look at 2022, excluding the extra week, it looks like 8% -- well, it is 8% for the top line, and about 6% EBIT growth. I just want to get a sense, is that the right relationship or algorithm to think about going forward? So like slight EBIT margin expansion off of the 9.3% that I think guiding you're to, excluding the extra week. And then I had a bigger-picture question. \nJohn Garratt: Sure. I would say, as you think about the 10% plus model, every element of that is very well intact. Starting at the top, we've never had a bigger pipeline of new unit growth with the -- for everybody in discount retail, about 17,000 potential opportunities there, not to mention Mexico. \n We're still seeing the same rate unit level economics on the top line, the bottom line and the returns. A ton of initiatives in place to drive sales, as well as we're seeing an outsized bigger impact from real estate. Not only we're seeing a 15% increase in sales per square foot productivity in the bigger box stores, but as we've mentioned, we're accelerating the number of new stores we're putting out there, and again, seeing really good impact on comp sales from the initiatives. \n And as you look at margin overall, operating margin overall, a lot of levers, as I just mentioned on Matt's question, with gross margin, SG&A. We stay laser-focused on that. We mentioned in the prepared comments, our Save to Serve program is alive and well. And since 2015, we've saved over $800 million from that. \n And so as you look at all the pieces, each year might be a little bit different. But I think that's the way to think about that, is the unit growth we've talked about, we feel very good about and are accelerating that a bit. We're seeing -- we've talked before about the impact of real estate, 150 to 200 basis points. And we're seeing the benefit at the high end of that. And then you have the initiatives on top of that and all the levers. \n So feel very good about our ability to drive 10% growth over the long term. And I think directionally, you're thinking about it right in terms of ongoing top line strength in that 2% to 4% comp range; and the ability over time, we believe, to hold, and in cases, expand our EBIT margins. \nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in general, I think there's definitely been a concern that you're lapping in 2022 tough discretionary comparisons, obviously. You talked about that. But wondering if you could give a little bit of color on how you think about that discretionary specifically and baked -- in terms of expectations baked into your guidance.\n And then it sounds like you're certainly not leaning away from discretionary in calendar '22. So maybe just some color on that given that, that is probably a category that will be pressured in the year, this year. \nJohn Garratt: Sure. As you think about the non-consumable sales and discretionary sales, what we have contemplated in our guidance is some moderation of that. We still continue to feel great about that side of the business, the growing benefit of the non-consumable initiative as well as the scaling of pOpshelf. But what we have contemplated, given the backdrop from a macro perspective, is somewhat of a moderation of mix back toward consumables, but not going back to where they were. So holding on to a lot of the strength in that business and the mix benefit from that, but some moderation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I'm wondering if you've given any thought to the 20% of the mix being $1. Has there been any debate around that mix moving? \n And then, Todd, you mentioned that at the customer, this could be a good environment for you. I take it as you haven't seen any sign yet that there's been any sensitivity to the current inflation. \nTodd Vasos: We didn't hear your first part of the question, Simeon. \nSimeon Gutman: The 20% of the merchandise mix. How do you think about that? Is there debate about changing that? \nTodd Vasos: The $1 mix. Yes. But I would tell you that every time we talk to our core customer, she tells us the same thing, how important that $1 is so that she can round out her month. We've always said here, it's an unfortunate situation, but our customer runs out of money before that month runs out. And that $1 bridges that last few days for her, always has, and that continues to do so. \n So what we've done is, in light of that information, also with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing on other goods, we've actually leaned into our $1 price point. And what you'll see, if you come into our stores over the near term, will be even more displays of $1 items on end caps and off-shelf displays and really pushing that side of the business because I think our customers will need us even more there. \n And we believe that over time, we could grow that where appropriate and not even stay at that 20% level. So we feel really good about that $1 price point. And the great thing is our vendor community across the board has leaned into that $1 price point with us as well. \nMichael Kessler: Right. This is Michael Kessler -- oh. Simeon, you got this? \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. I just wondered if any signs of trade-down yet? Or there hasn't been any sign? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Right now, we haven't seen a lot of trade-down yet. The great thing, though, Simeon, is we actually have a lot of that trade-down already embedded in, and I think there'll be more as inflation comes in. And the reason I say it's embedded in is that we are extremely, extremely confident and glad to see that the gains that we got during COVID, so call it the 2020 gains, we've kept a lot more of those customers than we even thought we would have kept. \n And that continues. Actually, we saw a slight acceleration of that as we moved through Q4. So it was great to see. And we know that, based on the credit card data and our marketing against that, a lot of these customers are in that trade-down area that would happen when trade down occurs. So we've got some of it already, and I believe we'll get even more as inflation continues to take hold across the U.S. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I was hoping to just touch on, I guess, on the comp line. I want to better understand the building blocks for comp growth this year, whether you can touch on inflation, traffic, the new store contribution. \n And the guidance implies an acceleration on the comp line as the year progresses. So I just wanted to better understand, what gives you confidence to drive that acceleration? So just any color there in terms of the stronger trends in the back half of the year. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way. As we see our comp growth accelerating, as we move sequentially from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year, and we feel great about -- we've said before, this model works very well at 2% to 4% comp. And we feel very good about the 2.5% comp guide, which would imply a pretty healthy 3-year stack with that. \n As you look at the building blocks of that, what we're seeing right now is we're retaining -- we're exceeding our expectations in terms of what we've done in terms of retaining the new customers, holding on to those bigger basket sizes. We're seeing a bigger impact from real estate, at the high end of that 150 to 200 basis points we've talked about. And as we mentioned, seeing a growing impact from our initiatives as they scale. \n And the other thing to point out is we're improving our in-stocks. As we improve our in-stocks, that's driving sales as well. Todd mentioned that we're closely watching the consumer. But history tells us that we do very well in all cycles of the economy. And if the consumer is pressured as they are increasingly with inflation, what we've seen is that customer more productive. With high fuel prices, we've seen them shop, as we mentioned, closer to home. And we've seen trade in, all of which benefit us. \n So when you put all these pieces together, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. And we think we're very well positioned, for this backdrop, to deliver that comp we've guided to. And we're going to go after more. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question on the CapEx side. So this year, CapEx as a percent of sales is closer to 4%. And I think historically, you've been in that 2.5% to 3% type range. So going forward, is this the right way to think about CapEx, at a more elevated level? \nJohn Garratt: No, great question. There's 2 pieces of that. And we have been, for the last few years, a little above 3%, but rounding down to 3%. This year, we're rounding up to 4%. And there's really 2 things I'd point to there. \n One is we've stepped up our real estate. We're accelerating our new unit growth, which obviously delivers great returns, and it helps the bottom line, but does add a little bit of CapEx. That impact is outsized this year really due to inflation, steel inflation. It's up substantially, still getting great returns even with that steel inflation factored in, still getting the same returns. We've talked about that 20% to 22% after-tax IRR. But that really is the nearer-term pressure, the commodity pressure from fixtures, HVACs, things like that as we do these projects. That we see that coming back down over time. \n If you exclude the impact of that near-term inflation, that puts us back to a point where we're back to close to where we were, rounding down to 3%. So we don't see something structurally different here other than we have stepped up our real estate, which is a great decision, which we're pleased with. But it's really the difference in the short term, is that commodity inflation. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: There's puts and takes with your margin outlook for this year. But if you assume you take on a little bit of leverage to buy back stock, it could imply that your operating margin is flat to maybe down 20 basis points versus last year. And if that's right, have all the initiatives that you've deployed translated to Dollar General's operating margin now being about 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019? And to what extent could this be eroded moving forward by a return to promotions and discounting in the broader retail environment? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. Look, I'll answer your question. If I don't, let me know. But what I would start with saying is that we continue to see the initiatives contributing to operating margin at or above what we expected. They're delivering across the board. But there are some near-term pressures. We talked about the puts and takes of gross margin. And we -- as you look at the gross margin, the biggest piece of that being inflation. Much of which we don't believe is structural. And we see signs of that easing, and certainly taking actions to make sure that eases. \n When you look at the SG&A side of that, there, too, we don't see a structural change there. We've talked about some geography as we spend a little bit of SG&A to save more gross margin. Again, those initiatives are delivering at or above what we expected. Throws off the geography a little bit. \n The other thing we have talked about is we did see some wage inflation above norm. We've said in the past that our wage inflation was running about 3% to 4% pre-pandemic. It was higher this year. As we look ahead to next year, we expect it to be a little bit higher than that 3% to 4%, but lower than what we saw in 2021. And we're already seeing moderation there. And we're in a great spot in terms of staffing levels. \n So as I look at our EBIT, I don't see anything structurally changing there. And as I mentioned to Karen, you see the ability for us over the long term to modestly increase that over time while driving the top line, too. And so feel very good about the algorithm and our ability to manage all the levers within gross margin and SG&A. Hopefully, that answers your question. \nMichael Lasser: It's helpful. My follow-up question is the competitive dynamics in the environment are ever so changing. The mass merchants and the grocery stores have been comping well above Dollar General for the last several quarters, which is unique in recent history. And now there's likely to be some changes at you're a big competitor. So how do you see this playing out over the next few quarters? Do you see some of these share changes as just a function of the unique dynamics, and you can reassert the leadership that Dollar General has historically had in the marketplace? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. So Michael, this is Todd. I would tell you that there's nothing that we see that doesn't suggest that our share gains won't start to come back to historical levels as we move through 2022. There's nothing structural that says that our comps won't get back to a more algorithmic level over time. \n And I think you have to look at, we had well oversized gains in 2020. And when you start looking on a 2-year stack basis, we stack up pretty well on a comp to our -- to those other classes of trade and by far out-exceeded our chief competitor in the space. So we feel very good. \n And then you've heard John and myself already talk about all these levers that we have. These are not new, right? These are ones that are well established and some newer ones that are already being embedded in our -- inside of our chain, where we can deliver, we believe, comp sales as we continue to move forward. The first quarter is going to be a little challenged, as we've already said. But as we move through the rest of the year, we feel better and better about where that comp is going to be. \n And then lastly, I would tell you that, your first part of the question, the competition, I would say it's very much the way it's been. I would tell you, we're on a little over 2 years now of pretty tame promotional environment. Obviously, we've had to take some price as others have done on an everyday basis due to some of the inflationary pressures that have been well documented out there. Matter of fact, our pricing position has never been better. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our indexes are as good if not better than they've ever been. \n So we feel great about our everyday price. And promotionally, we don't see anything in the near horizon that would say promotional pricing is going to escalate to any large degree. \nOperator: Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Todd, could you size up for us the impact that in-stocks have had on comps over the past couple of quarters? Particularly in your traffic trends. And looking ahead, where you are on the restoration of those in-stocks. \nTodd Vasos: Chuck, that's a great question, thanks for it. We believe it had a significant impact in Q4. We called it out in our prepared remarks. And due to many factors, one, obviously, we had some labor challenges in Q3 and Q4, in distribution. We're happy to report that we are now back to pre-pandemic levels on staffing. So we feel good about that. But it constrained our inbound and outbound. \n We also, if you recall, Jeff indicated in coming out of Q3, that we prioritized seasonal to ensure that our seasonal goods got on to the shelf. That slowed down our everyday goods onto the shelf and obviously gained more out-of-stocks there. \n Now as we move through Q4 and now into Q1, we feel much, much better about where our in-stock levels are. Are we back to historical levels yet? Not quite. But I don't think anybody is. The majority of our opportunities still lie within the vendor community in that the constraints from the vendor community has continued into Q1, not nearly at the levels we saw at the end of last year. But we continue to work with our vendor partners to ship on time and in full. And once we get to that point, which we believe we're working towards pretty quickly here, we'll be in much, much better shape as we move through the back half of the year. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one for Jeff. You called out that sales per square foot in the 8,500 square foot stores is 15% higher than the typical box. I was wondering if you could just unpack the delta, where you're getting that greater productivity from? \nJeffery Owen: Thanks, Chuck. We are pleased with our larger-format stores and really seeing that sales per square foot productivity. I think it goes back to what we've started a while ago, and that's really providing a fuller fill-in shop for our customers. When you build a bigger store, anybody can do that. But you got to have what the customer wants. And you got to have a customer that wants more from you. \n So this 8,500 and above square foot store allows us to really expand all the best of that merchants have brought to bear. So we've got expanded wellness. We've got our NCI in full. We've got our full cooler assortment in these stores as well. An expanded queue line. And quite frankly, room to grow. And so we also have produce in many of these stores as well. \n And so when you step back and you look at that, that's really what has driven the productivity in these stores. And I can tell you right now that we're just getting started here. And we look to be able to further serve our customer by listening to what she's asking for and leaning on our best-in-class merchant team, our supply chain team and operators that can execute this across a wide, broad group of stores. So feel real good about where that is headed in the future. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Thanks for all the great color today. One quick one to start on SNAP. There's been a lot of investor anxiety around reduction in SNAP benefits, what it means for you because it has grown considerably as a percentage of sales. What are you seeing as these payments have decreased? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. We've seen a modest decrease as we moved through the year. It peaked middle of the year around May. We've seen it come down a little bit as some of the states rolled off the emergency allotments. But with the Thrifty benefits -- Thrifty Food Plan benefit still in place, it's remained elevated. So if you look at Q4 this year versus Q4 last, still well above where it had been, just not quite where it was at the peak in May. \n As we move into next year, we're anticipating it to continue to moderate somewhat. However, that may be tapered just based on the cadence of when states roll off of that. So as we look ahead to next year, what we're assuming is that it's down from -- the benefit isn't as much as it was this year, but still elevated to pre-pandemic levels. And again, we've been taking share over a long time with the SNAP customers as we serve them so well, and you'll continue to see that as a key part of our business. \nEdward Kelly: Great. And then just a follow-up on self-distribution. You talked about significant expansion, doubling this year. Can you talk a bit more about the benefits operationally? I think you mentioned significant competitive advantage. Maybe more detail on what you mean there.\n And then from a P&L perspective, this 20% cost saves, is that 20% of domestic freight? Like is that how we think about what you're saying there? \nJeffery Owen: Ed, this is Jeff. First of all, thank you for the question. Our private fleet is something we started several years ago. And I think you nailed some of the reasons why we're so excited about it. \n First of all, our drivers are on the same team as our store teams, our merchant teams, and that's certainly just brings a better service to the overall operation. But also, it allows us much more flexibility in our control over the environment. And when you think about it right now, with about 20% of our outbound fleet, we're pleased with that, but we're even more excited about where this thing goes. And we like to use that term early innings. We're certainly in the early innings of this initiative. And as you mentioned, with the 20% reduction in our outbound transportation every time we convert, it's obviously a very good return. \n So as you think about this year, we're pleased to be at doubling that to about 40% of our outbound transportation needs. And we look to grow that even further over time as we scale this initiative and really distance ourselves and provide that competitive advantage because it is an incredible lever that we're able to pull. And excited that we started this several years ago. \nOperator: We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, and thanks for everyone joining the call and for all the questions. And thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, even in a consistently evolving environment. As you heard today, we're excited about our initiatives and plans for 2022, which we believe positions us well to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time. \n Overall, a mature retailer in growth mode, we believe this company is in a very strong position, which I think speaks to our strategy, our resilience and the strength of our culture and our people. As I said earlier, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and I can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Dollar General. \n Thank you for listening, and have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the critical needs of our communities, particularly over the past 2 years of the COVID pandemic.  \n Our fourth quarter performance was impacted by sustained and rising inflation, ongoing global supply chain pressure and a surge in Omicron cases, which impacted staffing levels at our distribution centers, contributing to elevated out-of-stocks. Despite these challenging conditions, our teams continued to focus on controlling what we can control and being there for our customers.  \n Because of their efforts and great execution over the past 2 years, we believe our underlying business is even stronger than before the pandemic, which positions us well to deliver solid sales and profit growth in 2022 and beyond. And while we expect this challenging environment to persist over the near term, which is reflected in our Q1 and fiscal 2022 outlook, we're confident we are taking the appropriate actions to manage through this period and deliver on our full year plan.  \n In fact, I'm pleased to report our staffing levels are back to 2019 pre-COVID levels in both our stores and distribution centers, and we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our in-stock positions. Additionally, although we experienced higher-than-expected product and supply chain cost in Q4, we are very confident in our price position as our price indexes, relative to competitors and other classes of trade, remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges.  \n And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important to our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment is $1 or less. And moving forward, we expect to continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, even in a challenging economic environment.  \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.  \n Turning now to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales increased 2.8% to $8.7 billion, following a 17.6% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales declined 1.4% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 11.3% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, Comp sales were lowest in January, with December being our strongest month of performance.  \n Our fourth quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size. Notably, our average basket size at year-end was approximately $16 and consisted of nearly 6 items. This compares to an average basket size of about $13 and 5 items at the end of 2019, which we believe reflects the growing impact of our strategic initiatives and a degree of inflation.  \n In addition, we are pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. And even as our market share in highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q4, we feel good about our share gains on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, which continues to exceed our initial expectations.  \n For the full year, net sales increased 1.4% to $34.2 billion, which was on the high end of our full year guidance and on top of a robust 21.6% increase in fiscal 2020. Comp sales for the year decreased 2.8%, which translates into a very healthy 13.5% increase on a 2-year stack basis.  \n In total, we completed more than 2,900 real estate projects during the year, including the opening of our 18,000th Dollar General store and 50 stand-alone pOpshelf locations as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth.  \n From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in key areas, including the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as well as our most recent initiatives focused on health and international expansion as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.  \n Overall, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results, which further validate our belief that our strategic actions and targeted investments positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And while our mission and culture remain unchanged as the foundation for our success, with our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I believe Dollar General is a much different company and is in a much stronger competitive position than it was just a few short years ago.  \n As a result, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the enormous growth opportunities we see ahead. \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Sure, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, I'll first start by saying, we've always said here that the health of the consumer, this low-end consumer that we serve the most here at Dollar General, is usually geared and attached to whether they're gainfully employed or not. I'm happy to say that, with the labor market the way it is, that she is gainfully employed, working as many hours as she would like to right now. Matter of fact, we believe that approximately $1.20 increase year-over-year in her wages are in her wallet. So that is a significant amount. \n Now to your point, there are some other things, other headwinds here that we watch out for. Obviously, inflation has definitely taken a toll on some of that additional wage growth that she's seen. And then recently, over the last couple of weeks, gas prices are up $0.70 a gallon. So that -- we watch that very carefully. \n Now we always also said that once that gas price reaches over $4 a gallon, which it has now, that we normally see the consumers stay closer to home, which bodes very well for that value and convenient message that we have out there for our core consumer and that we deliver every day. That value and convenient message reigns supreme at the end of the day across the company here at Dollar General and with our core customer. \n So again, as you think about it, tougher times for the consumer normally means that she needs us more, and we normally start to see a trade-down once that occurs and we'll be watching out for that. Again, that value and convenience really attracts that trade-in, trade-down customer. \n As far as the drivers of what we believe. Well, our initiatives, Matt, as you know, have been very, very successful over the last 6 to 7 years here at Dollar General. And they're the cornerstone of why we feel confident in our guide for 2022. Obviously a lot of year ahead of us, but those initiatives are truly the cornerstone of that. \n But then when you think again about that value and convenience message we have, if the market gets a little tighter from a labor perspective or inflation continues to pull more money out of the consumer's wallet, we feel that we're very well positioned as we move through '22 as well. We didn't hear your first part of the question, Simeon. The $1 mix. Yes. But I would tell you that every time we talk to our core customer, she tells us the same thing, how important that $1 is so that she can round out her month. We've always said here, it's an unfortunate situation, but our customer runs out of money before that month runs out. And that $1 bridges that last few days for her, always has, and that continues to do so. \n So what we've done is, in light of that information, also with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing on other goods, we've actually leaned into our $1 price point. And what you'll see, if you come into our stores over the near term, will be even more displays of $1 items on end caps and off-shelf displays and really pushing that side of the business because I think our customers will need us even more there. \n And we believe that over time, we could grow that where appropriate and not even stay at that 20% level. So we feel really good about that $1 price point. And the great thing is our vendor community across the board has leaned into that $1 price point with us as well. Yes. Right now, we haven't seen a lot of trade-down yet. The great thing, though, Simeon, is we actually have a lot of that trade-down already embedded in, and I think there'll be more as inflation comes in. And the reason I say it's embedded in is that we are extremely, extremely confident and glad to see that the gains that we got during COVID, so call it the 2020 gains, we've kept a lot more of those customers than we even thought we would have kept. \n And that continues. Actually, we saw a slight acceleration of that as we moved through Q4. So it was great to see. And we know that, based on the credit card data and our marketing against that, a lot of these customers are in that trade-down area that would happen when trade down occurs. So we've got some of it already, and I believe we'll get even more as inflation continues to take hold across the U.S. Yes. So Michael, this is Todd. I would tell you that there's nothing that we see that doesn't suggest that our share gains won't start to come back to historical levels as we move through 2022. There's nothing structural that says that our comps won't get back to a more algorithmic level over time. \n And I think you have to look at, we had well oversized gains in 2020. And when you start looking on a 2-year stack basis, we stack up pretty well on a comp to our -- to those other classes of trade and by far out-exceeded our chief competitor in the space. So we feel very good. \n And then you've heard John and myself already talk about all these levers that we have. These are not new, right? These are ones that are well established and some newer ones that are already being embedded in our -- inside of our chain, where we can deliver, we believe, comp sales as we continue to move forward. The first quarter is going to be a little challenged, as we've already said. But as we move through the rest of the year, we feel better and better about where that comp is going to be. \n And then lastly, I would tell you that, your first part of the question, the competition, I would say it's very much the way it's been. I would tell you, we're on a little over 2 years now of pretty tame promotional environment. Obviously, we've had to take some price as others have done on an everyday basis due to some of the inflationary pressures that have been well documented out there. Matter of fact, our pricing position has never been better. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our indexes are as good if not better than they've ever been. \n So we feel great about our everyday price. And promotionally, we don't see anything in the near horizon that would say promotional pricing is going to escalate to any large degree. Chuck, that's a great question, thanks for it. We believe it had a significant impact in Q4. We called it out in our prepared remarks. And due to many factors, one, obviously, we had some labor challenges in Q3 and Q4, in distribution. We're happy to report that we are now back to pre-pandemic levels on staffing. So we feel good about that. But it constrained our inbound and outbound. \n We also, if you recall, Jeff indicated in coming out of Q3, that we prioritized seasonal to ensure that our seasonal goods got on to the shelf. That slowed down our everyday goods onto the shelf and obviously gained more out-of-stocks there. \n Now as we move through Q4 and now into Q1, we feel much, much better about where our in-stock levels are. Are we back to historical levels yet? Not quite. But I don't think anybody is. The majority of our opportunities still lie within the vendor community in that the constraints from the vendor community has continued into Q1, not nearly at the levels we saw at the end of last year. But we continue to work with our vendor partners to ship on time and in full. And once we get to that point, which we believe we're working towards pretty quickly here, we'll be in much, much better shape as we move through the back half of the year. Thank you, and thanks for everyone joining the call and for all the questions. And thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, even in a consistently evolving environment. As you heard today, we're excited about our initiatives and plans for 2022, which we believe positions us well to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time. \n Overall, a mature retailer in growth mode, we believe this company is in a very strong position, which I think speaks to our strategy, our resilience and the strength of our culture and our people. As I said earlier, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and I can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Dollar General. \n Thank you for listening, and have a great day."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and the full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.  \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q4 2020 and fiscal year 2020 were both positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% and 28%, respectively, in our combined nonconsumables categories. \n For Q4 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.2%, a decrease of 131 basis points. The decrease compared to Q4 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation and distribution costs and a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category.  \n Of note, while we expect some relief as we move through 2022, our Q4 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q4 2020, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $100 million. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales in higher inventory markups.  \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22% in the quarter, a decrease of 16 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by lower incremental costs related to COVID-19, lower hurricane-related expenses and a reduction in incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by certain expenses that were higher as a percentage of sales, including retail labor, occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization.  \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 8.7% to $797 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.2%, a decrease of 116 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.2% and compares to 22.7% in the fourth quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter decreased 1.9% to $2.57, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% over a 2-year period.  \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remained strong and provided us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $5.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 7% overall and 1.4% on a per store basis. Importantly, as Todd noted, we have begun to see a meaningful improvement in our in-stock levels since the end of the year and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers with the products they want and need.  \n In 2021, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion. Total capital expenditures for the year were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.  \n During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $490 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.1 billion.  \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.  \n Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. First, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal year 2022 includes a 53rd week which will occur during the last period of the fourth quarter. We also continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding, among other things, the impacts on the business arising from the current geopolitical conflict and the recovery from the global COVID pandemic, including recovery of the U.S. economy, changes in consumer behavior, labor markets and government stimulus and assistance programs. \n Despite these uncertainties, including cost inflation, ongoing pressure in the supply chain and rising fuel costs, we are pleased to provide annual guidance that reflects our confidence in the business. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2022. \n Net sales growth of approximately 10%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; same-store sales growth of approximately 2.5%; and EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate range of 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes the impact of increases in the cost of certain building materials as well as continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.  \n With regards to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.55 per share, which represents an increase of 31%. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $2.75 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our continued strong liquidity position, the benefit from the 53rd week and our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business.  \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant stimulus benefit from Q1 2021, including gross margin expansion of 208 basis points. We also anticipate ongoing cost inflation, including elevated supply chain and fuel costs. \n While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the unusual lap in the significant inflationary environment in Q1, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales decline of 1% to 2% in Q1 with an EPS in the range of approximately $2.25 to $2.35.  \n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, could drive additional benefits over the year despite continued cost pressures in the near term. Partially offsetting some of these benefits are rising fuel costs as well as an expected return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022.  \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. And we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of an expected increase in wage inflation.  \n In summary, we are proud of our fourth quarter and full year results in 2021, which are a testament to the perseverance and execution by the team. Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for 2022, including our outlook for sales and EPS growth as well as our planned significant returns to shareholders via an increased dividend payout and increased share repurchases.  \n As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in our business and employees for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Sure. Sure. So a lot of pieces there. I'll try and attack all those as I kind of walk through the puts and takes of gross margins. I'll start by saying we're really pleased with what we've done with gross margin in recent years. As you look at 2021, it's up about 100 basis over 2019 levels. \n Now we didn't give specific margin -- gross margin guidance for 2022, but we did mention that Q1 in particular would be pressured as we're lapping a pretty significant expansion last year of 208 basis points that certainly benefited from favorable mix fueled by stimulus. In addition to that tough lap, we have cost inflation continuing in Q1, which is driven by supply chain, fuel and product costs, and to a lesser extent, a return to recent historical rates of markdowns and shrink. Still lower than the pandemic levels, but normalizing a little bit. \n So certainly, there's some near-term pressures persisting in Q1 in the first part of the year. But bear in mind, as we move through the year, the lap gets easier in the second half as we're lapping the heavy inflation from this year. \n And just as a frame of reference, in Q4, we had about 200 basis points of added pressure to gross margin from the combination of supply chain, which was about $100 million incremental year-over-year impact; and the LIFO provision, which was $72 million. We don't see this as structural. We anticipate some moderation in cost pressures. We're already seeing this in transportation, supply chain, for instance. \n Plus, when you look at the benefits of the initiatives and the cost-reduction actions we have in place, we see a growing benefit from that. For instance, if you look at private fleet, we mentioned we're going to double that in size from the end of 2021 to the end of 2022. That drives, as Jeff mentioned, about 20% savings each time we switch from a third-party carrier to in-house. And of course, we have the growing benefit of the initiatives that Todd mentioned, which not only helped the top line but the bottom line when you think of DG Fresh, NCI and pOpshelf. \n And there's still -- to your other question, there's still a lot of runway there. As we continue to optimize DG Fresh, get the leverage from that now that we can negotiate directly on that and we're top 3 vendors -- or customers, in many cases. NCI, we'll continue the rollout of that and virtually complete that this year. And then you have the growing benefit of pOpshelf, which we mentioned comes out of the ground with margins north of 40% and should only grow from there as we get scale. And we've talked about all the other levers we have. And then not to mention just our ability to leverage our scale as a limited SKU operator. \n So we've contemplated all this in the EPS guidance, which we feel very good about. While there's some near-term pressures, especially in the early part of the year, we feel great about the initiatives, the other levers we have. And we still believe we can expand gross margin over the long term. Sure. I would say, as you think about the 10% plus model, every element of that is very well intact. Starting at the top, we've never had a bigger pipeline of new unit growth with the -- for everybody in discount retail, about 17,000 potential opportunities there, not to mention Mexico. \n We're still seeing the same rate unit level economics on the top line, the bottom line and the returns. A ton of initiatives in place to drive sales, as well as we're seeing an outsized bigger impact from real estate. Not only we're seeing a 15% increase in sales per square foot productivity in the bigger box stores, but as we've mentioned, we're accelerating the number of new stores we're putting out there, and again, seeing really good impact on comp sales from the initiatives. \n And as you look at margin overall, operating margin overall, a lot of levers, as I just mentioned on Matt's question, with gross margin, SG&A. We stay laser-focused on that. We mentioned in the prepared comments, our Save to Serve program is alive and well. And since 2015, we've saved over $800 million from that. \n And so as you look at all the pieces, each year might be a little bit different. But I think that's the way to think about that, is the unit growth we've talked about, we feel very good about and are accelerating that a bit. We're seeing -- we've talked before about the impact of real estate, 150 to 200 basis points. And we're seeing the benefit at the high end of that. And then you have the initiatives on top of that and all the levers. \n So feel very good about our ability to drive 10% growth over the long term. And I think directionally, you're thinking about it right in terms of ongoing top line strength in that 2% to 4% comp range; and the ability over time, we believe, to hold, and in cases, expand our EBIT margins. Sure. As you think about the non-consumable sales and discretionary sales, what we have contemplated in our guidance is some moderation of that. We still continue to feel great about that side of the business, the growing benefit of the non-consumable initiative as well as the scaling of pOpshelf. But what we have contemplated, given the backdrop from a macro perspective, is somewhat of a moderation of mix back toward consumables, but not going back to where they were. So holding on to a lot of the strength in that business and the mix benefit from that, but some moderation. Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way. As we see our comp growth accelerating, as we move sequentially from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year, and we feel great about -- we've said before, this model works very well at 2% to 4% comp. And we feel very good about the 2.5% comp guide, which would imply a pretty healthy 3-year stack with that. \n As you look at the building blocks of that, what we're seeing right now is we're retaining -- we're exceeding our expectations in terms of what we've done in terms of retaining the new customers, holding on to those bigger basket sizes. We're seeing a bigger impact from real estate, at the high end of that 150 to 200 basis points we've talked about. And as we mentioned, seeing a growing impact from our initiatives as they scale. \n And the other thing to point out is we're improving our in-stocks. As we improve our in-stocks, that's driving sales as well. Todd mentioned that we're closely watching the consumer. But history tells us that we do very well in all cycles of the economy. And if the consumer is pressured as they are increasingly with inflation, what we've seen is that customer more productive. With high fuel prices, we've seen them shop, as we mentioned, closer to home. And we've seen trade in, all of which benefit us. \n So when you put all these pieces together, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. And we think we're very well positioned, for this backdrop, to deliver that comp we've guided to. And we're going to go after more. No, great question. There's 2 pieces of that. And we have been, for the last few years, a little above 3%, but rounding down to 3%. This year, we're rounding up to 4%. And there's really 2 things I'd point to there. \n One is we've stepped up our real estate. We're accelerating our new unit growth, which obviously delivers great returns, and it helps the bottom line, but does add a little bit of CapEx. That impact is outsized this year really due to inflation, steel inflation. It's up substantially, still getting great returns even with that steel inflation factored in, still getting the same returns. We've talked about that 20% to 22% after-tax IRR. But that really is the nearer-term pressure, the commodity pressure from fixtures, HVACs, things like that as we do these projects. That we see that coming back down over time. \n If you exclude the impact of that near-term inflation, that puts us back to a point where we're back to close to where we were, rounding down to 3%. So we don't see something structurally different here other than we have stepped up our real estate, which is a great decision, which we're pleased with. But it's really the difference in the short term, is that commodity inflation. Yes. Look, I'll answer your question. If I don't, let me know. But what I would start with saying is that we continue to see the initiatives contributing to operating margin at or above what we expected. They're delivering across the board. But there are some near-term pressures. We talked about the puts and takes of gross margin. And we -- as you look at the gross margin, the biggest piece of that being inflation. Much of which we don't believe is structural. And we see signs of that easing, and certainly taking actions to make sure that eases. \n When you look at the SG&A side of that, there, too, we don't see a structural change there. We've talked about some geography as we spend a little bit of SG&A to save more gross margin. Again, those initiatives are delivering at or above what we expected. Throws off the geography a little bit. \n The other thing we have talked about is we did see some wage inflation above norm. We've said in the past that our wage inflation was running about 3% to 4% pre-pandemic. It was higher this year. As we look ahead to next year, we expect it to be a little bit higher than that 3% to 4%, but lower than what we saw in 2021. And we're already seeing moderation there. And we're in a great spot in terms of staffing levels. \n So as I look at our EBIT, I don't see anything structurally changing there. And as I mentioned to Karen, you see the ability for us over the long term to modestly increase that over time while driving the top line, too. And so feel very good about the algorithm and our ability to manage all the levers within gross margin and SG&A. Hopefully, that answers your question. Yes. We've seen a modest decrease as we moved through the year. It peaked middle of the year around May. We've seen it come down a little bit as some of the states rolled off the emergency allotments. But with the Thrifty benefits -- Thrifty Food Plan benefit still in place, it's remained elevated. So if you look at Q4 this year versus Q4 last, still well above where it had been, just not quite where it was at the peak in May. \n As we move into next year, we're anticipating it to continue to moderate somewhat. However, that may be tapered just based on the cadence of when states roll off of that. So as we look ahead to next year, what we're assuming is that it's down from -- the benefit isn't as much as it was this year, but still elevated to pre-pandemic levels. And again, we've been taking share over a long time with the SNAP customers as we serve them so well, and you'll continue to see that as a key part of our business."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, including our plans for 2022. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We have a growing portfolio of initiatives which are contributing to our strong results as well as strengthening the foundation for future growth. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights as well as some of our next steps. \n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 11,700 stores at the end of 2021. We continued to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across the NCI store base. Notably, NCI stores outperformed non-NCI stores in both average ticket and customer traffic, driving an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average in NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and we are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our newest store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value, with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. \n During the quarter, we opened 25 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 55 and exceeding our initial goal of 50 stores. Additionally, we opened 11 new store within a store concepts during Q4, bringing the total number of Dollar General Market stores with a smaller-footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 25 at the end of the year. And we continue to be pleased with the results. \n In 2022, we plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count and open up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts. We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. \n In addition to the early success of pOpshelf, we have been able to take some of our learnings and apply them in our Dollar General store base, particularly in further enhancing our nonconsumables offering. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multi-phased shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. \n The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. Notably, DG Fresh was a meaningful positive contributor to our gross margin rate in 2021, and we expect to see continued benefits in 2022. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. In fact, our perishables department had a high single-digit comp increase in Q4 and contributed more comp sales dollars than any other department for both Q4 and the full year. Importantly, the sales penetration of these categories has increased to approximately 9% as compared to approximately 8% prior to the rollout of DG Fresh. \n In 2022, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale and deliver an even wider product selection. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of Q4, we offered produce in more than 2,100 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2021, we added more than 65,000 cooler doors across our store base. In 2022, we again expect to install more than 65,000 additional doors as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,200 stores at the end of 2021, with plans to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. As we move toward becoming more of a health destination, particularly in rural America, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2021, we completed a total of 2,902 real estate projects, including 1,050 new stores, 1,752 remodels and 100 relocations. \n For 2022, we remain on track to execute nearly 3,000 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger, 8,500 square foot store format, allowing for an expanded assortment and room to accommodate future growth as we respond to our customers' desire for an even wider product selection. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of all of our larger-format stores as average sales per square foot are about 15% above an average traditional store. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, and included in our expected new store total, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally with the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. \n Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust with more brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer in the country. And we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2021 with over 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n As with everything we do, the customer is at the center of our digital initiative. Our partnership with DoorDash is the latest example of these efforts as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 10,700 stores at the end of Q4, and we are very pleased with the early results, including our ability to generate profitable transactions as well as better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n In addition, our DG Media Network is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our brand partners with our customers. To that end, we significantly grew the reach of this network in 2021, increasing from 6 million unique active profiles to more than 75 million, enabling our vendors to now reach over 90% of our DG customers through the DG Media Network. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Notably, the Save to Serve program contributed more than $800 million in cumulative cost savings from its inception in 2015 through the end of 2021. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. \n The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. \n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 6,100 stores at the end of 2021. We continue to be pleased with our results, including strong and growing customer adoption rates and high scores on speed and ease of checkout. In 2022, we plan to expand this offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. \n Looking ahead, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders in 2022. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. \n I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 700 tractors and accounted for approximately 20% of our outbound transportation fleet at the end of 2021. We are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors, we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. \n Importantly, we save an average of 20% of associated costs every time we replace a third-party tractor with one from our private fleet. Moving forward, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control in our supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. \n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created thousands of new jobs in 2021, providing career growth opportunities for existing associates and the start of a career for many others. In 2022, we now expect to create more than 10,000 net new jobs as a result of our continued growth. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust, as evidenced by our internal placement of more than 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position. \n We also continue to innovate on development for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. These investments include offering an enhanced college tuition benefit for our associates and their families as well as continuing to facilitate driver training programs for associates who would like to become drivers in our private fleet. \n In addition to our focus on development, we continue to focus on further enhancing the associate experience and our strong workplace culture. \n Collectively, these investments continue to yield positive results across our organization, including healthy applicant flow and strong critical staffing levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we made significant progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2021. These efforts have further strengthened our foundation and position heading into 2022 as we continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. \n In closing, I'm proud of the team's strong and resilient performance in 2021. As we enter 2022, we are laser-focused on executing and delivering our robust plans, which we believe will further enhance our unique combination of value and convenience for our customers while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 163,000 employees for their tireless dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thanks, Chuck. We are pleased with our larger-format stores and really seeing that sales per square foot productivity. I think it goes back to what we've started a while ago, and that's really providing a fuller fill-in shop for our customers. When you build a bigger store, anybody can do that. But you got to have what the customer wants. And you got to have a customer that wants more from you. \n So this 8,500 and above square foot store allows us to really expand all the best of that merchants have brought to bear. So we've got expanded wellness. We've got our NCI in full. We've got our full cooler assortment in these stores as well. An expanded queue line. And quite frankly, room to grow. And so we also have produce in many of these stores as well. \n And so when you step back and you look at that, that's really what has driven the productivity in these stores. And I can tell you right now that we're just getting started here. And we look to be able to further serve our customer by listening to what she's asking for and leaning on our best-in-class merchant team, our supply chain team and operators that can execute this across a wide, broad group of stores. So feel real good about where that is headed in the future. Ed, this is Jeff. First of all, thank you for the question. Our private fleet is something we started several years ago. And I think you nailed some of the reasons why we're so excited about it. \n First of all, our drivers are on the same team as our store teams, our merchant teams, and that's certainly just brings a better service to the overall operation. But also, it allows us much more flexibility in our control over the environment. And when you think about it right now, with about 20% of our outbound fleet, we're pleased with that, but we're even more excited about where this thing goes. And we like to use that term early innings. We're certainly in the early innings of this initiative. And as you mentioned, with the 20% reduction in our outbound transportation every time we convert, it's obviously a very good return. \n So as you think about this year, we're pleased to be at doubling that to about 40% of our outbound transportation needs. And we look to grow that even further over time as we scale this initiative and really distance ourselves and provide that competitive advantage because it is an incredible lever that we're able to pull. And excited that we started this several years ago."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Robert, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, December 2, 2021. [Operator Instructions] The call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] \n Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, you may begin your conference. \nDonny Lau: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events. \n Let me caution you that today's comments include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements about our financial guidance, strategy, initiatives, plans, goals, priorities, opportunities, investments, expectations or beliefs about future matters and other statements that are not limited to historical fact. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These factors include, but are not limited to, those identified in our earnings release issued this morning under Risk Factors in our 2020 Form 10-K filed on March 19, 2021, and in the comments that are made on this call. \n You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. We will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which, as I mentioned, is posted on investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] \n Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the needs of our customers, communities and each other.  \n Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, including elevated cost pressures and broad-based supply chain disruptions, our teams remained focused on controlling what we can control and they are delivering for our customers. We are grateful for their efforts. \n Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment. And although we've experienced higher-than-expected costs, both from a product and supply chain perspective, we're very confident in our price position as our price indexes relative to our competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials, at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important for our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment remains at $1 or less. And moving forward, we will continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. \n As the largest retailer in the U.S. by store count, with over 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe our presence in local communities across the country provides another distinct advantage and positions us well for continued success. Overall, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position, while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. \n To that end, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we expect to execute a total of nearly 3,000 real estate projects in 2022, including 1,100 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. Of note, these plans include the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as we expect to nearly triple our store count next year as compared to our fiscal '21 year-end target of up to 50 locations. In addition, given the sustained performance of our pOpshelf concept, which continues to exceed our expectations, we plan to further accelerate the pace of new store openings as we move ahead, targeting a total of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by fiscal year-end 2025. Importantly, we anticipate these new pOpshelf locations will be incremental to our annual Dollar General store opening plans as we look to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see for both brands. \n We are also now at the early stages of plans to extend our footprint into Mexico, which will represent our first store locations outside the Continental United States. We believe Mexico represents a compelling expansion opportunity for Dollar General, given its demographics and proximity to the U.S., and we are confident that our unique value and convenience proposition will resonate with the Mexican consumer. While our initial entry into Mexico is focused on piloting a small number of stores in 2022, we expect the seeds we plant today will ultimately turn into additional growth opportunities in the future. \n Finally, as previously announced, we recently introduced our digital services by partnering with DoorDash to provide delivery in under an hour in over 10,000 locations, further enhancing our convenience proposition while broadening our reach with new customers. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. \n Net sales increased 3.9% to $8.5 billion, following a 17.3% increase in Q3 of 2020. Comp sales declined 0.6% to the prior year quarter, which translates to a robust 11.6% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in September, with October being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 sales to date are trending in line with our expectations. Our third quarter sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size, even as we lapped significant growth in average basket size last year. \n In addition, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q2 of 2021, and we continue to be pleased with the retention of the new customers acquired in 2020. We're also pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories. And even as our market share in total highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q3, we feel good about our overall share gains on a 2-year stack basis. \n Collectively, our third quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we continue to lay the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. \n Overall, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit.  \n As a reminder, gross profit in Q3 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% in our combined non-consumable categories. For Q3 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.8%, a decrease of 57 basis points but an increase of 121 basis points compared to Q3 2019. The decrease compared to Q3 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.9%, an increase of 105 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales in the current year period, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs. The quarter also included $16 million of disaster-related expenses attributable to Hurricane Ida. \n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the third quarter decreased 13.9% to $665.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 162 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement of 78 basis points compared to Q3 2019. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 21.6% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for Q3 decreased 10% to $2.08, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 21% over a 2-year period. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 5.4% overall and a decrease of 0.1% on a per store basis. And while we're not satisfied with our overall in-stock levels, we continue to make good progress and are focused on improving our in-stock position, particularly in our consumables business. Looking ahead, we are pleased with our inventory position for the holiday shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of goods for the remainder of the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.2 billion. \n Capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $779 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $360 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of Q3, the total remaining authorization for future repurchases was $619 million. We announced today that our Board has increased its authorization by $2 billion. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including any changes in consumer behavior and the corresponding impacts on our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including cost inflation and ongoing pressure throughout the supply chain, we are updating our sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong performance through the first 3 quarters as well as our expectations for Q4. \n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 1% to 1.5%; a same-store sales decline of approximately 3% to 2.5%, but which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 22% to 24% or approximately 21% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Finally, our expectations for capital spending, share repurchases and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on August 26, 2021. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our outlook over the next couple of months, given the continued uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional supply chain disruptions and the impact of the end of certain federal aid, such as additional unemployment benefits and stimulus payments. \n Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rate. Consistent with Q2 and Q3, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter due to a higher LIFO provision as a result of cost of goods increases, a less favorable sales mix compared to the prior year quarter and an increase in markdown rates as we continue to cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020.  \n We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in Q4 compared to the 2020 period. Like other retailers, our business continues to be impacted by higher costs due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures. \n With regards to SG&A, we continue to expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives. This amount includes $56 million in incremental investments made during the first 3 quarters of 2021. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.  \n Finally, our updated guidance does not include any impact from the proposed federal vaccine and testing mandate, including potential disruptions to the business or labor market or any incremental expense. \n In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which are a testament to the strong performance and execution by the team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a great job this quarter executing against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. \n Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. The NCI offering was available in nearly 11,000 stores at the end of Q3 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. Notably, this performance is contributing an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average and NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we now plan to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,500 stores by year-end, including over 2,000 stores in our light version and we expect to complete the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022.  \n Moving to our pOpshelf concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a unique in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we added 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 30, opened our first 14 store-within-a-store concepts and celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first pOpshelf store opening. \n For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger format Dollar General Market stores. Importantly, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our pOpshelf stores, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin. In fact, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. We believe this bodes well for the future as we move towards our goal of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in Q2 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing as DG Fresh remains a meaningful contributor to our gross margin rate. \n Another goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are very happy with the performance on this front as overall comp sales of our frozen and refrigerated goods outperformed all other product categories in Q3, even against the difficult prior year sales comparison. Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors  and associated sales. \n With regards to our cooler expansion program, during the first 3 quarters, we added more than 52,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 65,000 additional cooler doors in 2021, the majority of which will be in high-capacity coolers. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of about 30% more feet of selling space and nearly 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 800 stores at the end of Q3, with plans to expand to approximately 1,000 stores by year-end. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 18,000th store, which reflects the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team as we continue to expand our footprint and further enhance our ability to serve additional customers. \n Through the first 3 quarters, we completed a total of 2,386 real estate projects, including 798 new stores, 1,506 remodels and 82 relocations. For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. In addition, we now have produce in approximately 1,900 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of over 2,000 stores by year-end. For 2022, we plan to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. We also plan to add produce in approximately 1,000 additional stores next year, with the goal of ultimately expanding this offering to a total of up to 10,000 stores over time. \n Of note, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot new store prototype, allowing for a more optimal assortment and room to accommodate future growth. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend about 15% above an average traditional store. Our 2022 real estate plans also include opening approximately 100 additional pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 150 by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts. \n As Todd noted, we are also very excited about our plans to expand our footprint internationally for the first time, with plans to open up to 10 stores in Mexico by year-end 2022 as we look to extend our value and convenience offering to even more communities, while continuing to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. And the good news is we believe we still have a long runway for new unit growth ahead of us. \n In fact, across our Dollar General, pOpshelf and DGX format types, we estimate there are approximately 17,000 new store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States alone. Although these opportunities are available to all small box retailers, we expect to continue capturing a disproportionate share as we move forward. And while still early, we expect our entry into Mexico will ultimately unlock a significant number of additional new unit opportunities in the years to come. When taken together, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. Of note, we ended Q3 with over 4.4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n As Todd noted, our partnership with DoorDash is another example of meeting the evolving needs of our customers by providing the savings offered by Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n Our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, is also seeing strong results, including significant growth in the number of campaigns on our platform. Overall, we remain very excited about the long-term growth potential of this business, and we look to better connect our brand partners with our customers in a way that is accretive to the customer experience.\n Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement across our digital ecosystem.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.\n The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Looking ahead, our plans now include expanding this offering to over 6,000 stores by year-end 2021 and to the majority of our store base by the end of 2022 as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, in 2022, we plan to create more than 8,000 net new jobs. In addition, our growth also fosters an environment, where employees have opportunities to advance to roles with increasing levels of responsibility and meaningful wage growth and a relatively short time frame. In fact, over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we offer our teams. \n Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by our robust promotion pipeline, healthy applicant flows and staffing above traditional levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n We also recently completed our annual community giving campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people. Our mission of serving others is deeply embedded in the daily culture at Dollar General, and I am so proud to be a part of such an incredible team.\n In closing, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. And with the actions and multiyear initiatives we have in place, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation. As we are in the midst of a truly unique and busy holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 162,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, I'd like to put the spotlight on the low-income consumer. We have stimulus rolling off, we're going to be lapping massive stimulus in the first half of next year. And on the other side, you have jobs and wages starting to grow. Can you talk about your stance? Are you seeing any signs that the customer is getting stronger or weaker? \nTodd Vasos: Simeon, it's Todd. I would tell you that our core consumer continues to be in pretty good shape. You're 100% right that a lot of the stimulus money has now dissipated. But I've always said, and our core customer has always said, as long as she is gainfully employed, that is probably the biggest driver of her confidence to spend. And there is no doubt that she is gainfully employed right now and can work as many hours as she may or may not want to. But as we look through the remainder of this year and into next, we believe that she'll continue to be gainfully employed. And with that, will have money to spend. \n And then the other thing to think about with this low-cost consumer, to your point, we continue to show great value, right? When you look at how we operate, our pricing is as good as ever against all classes of trade. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're not walking away from a $1 price point. We believe that's so important to her as we continue to move forward. Not that we believe it, she tells us that each and every day. So I think that value and convenience message will continue to resonate with our core consumer. \nSimeon Gutman: And maybe transitioning to the fourth quarter, more of a near-term financial question, it implies that the fourth quarter EBIT margin is going to be pretty below where it was 2 years ago, I think, by about 80 bps, even though year-to-date, you're up nicely versus 2 years ago and even Q3 was as well. So besides the typical conservatism in the way you model, anything else can we speak to discrete incremental expense for investments? \nJohn Garratt: No, nothing incremental in terms of investments. We noted the $70 million, $80 million of investments in the strategic initiatives, which again are accretive overall. And then the other thing we pointed out is just on the gross margin. You certainly have a continued pressure that we anticipate, associated with the supply chain, which, again, we believe that's transitory in nature. It's a supply and demand issue, but we saw that increase as we went into -- from Q2 to Q3, and we expect that to remain elevated year-over-year as we look at Q4.\n And then obviously, the other big piece here is inflation. We're seeing higher prices passed along from vendors, and that's showing up in terms of the LIFO provision, which we noted. But that's really the key drivers I would point to on a 2-year basis. And then on a 1-year basis, I would just point to the very difficult lap as we're lapping extremely high sales of nonconsumable goods, which have a higher margin as well as unusually low markdowns around clearance items, just given the extremely high sell-through last year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter. So Todd, the high end of your full year comp guidance implies a 12.7% stack in the fourth quarter. I think that's more than 100 basis points improvement from the third quarter. Any drivers behind the recent reacceleration in business? Is this value in convenience as you cited in the face of rising cost of living for your core consumer? Or is this confidence based on what you've seen in November? Just any color on the fourth quarter so far. \nTodd Vasos: Thanks for the question, Matt. As you know, right, we put out a range and we definitely see that the consumer is still shopping at a pretty good rate. But I would tell you there's a lot of the quarter left. So let's make sure we temper that just a bit. But the great thing about Dollar General is that we have never taken our eye off the ball on what that consumer is looking for. And that gives us that confidence as we move through this year and into next on our ability to continue to service that consumer and if there is any trade down that tends to come in that, that consumer will also enjoy those benefits.\n And then lastly, we still are very positive on the trade-down consumer that came in during the pandemic or trade-in is probably a better term for it. And those numbers continue to exceed our expectation on retention rate. So we've got that moving through the fourth quarter and into next year as well. So with all that high end of the guidance is very attainable. But on the other side, we've got a lot of quarter left and that's why we give you that nice range. \nMatthew Boss: Great. It's a perfect follow-up, I think, for my second question. If I use that same math, 12.7% 2-year stack in the fourth quarter, again, high end of your guide exiting the year. It basically translates to a 6% to 7% 1-year comp, and that's double your pre-pandemic 3-year average. I think it was around 3% to 3.5%. So is this new customer acquisition? Is this market share gains? Is this a trade-down consumer? I guess, question being is, how best do you think about your ability to hold some of these gains as we think about next year and beyond? \nJohn Garratt: You're right, Matt. This is John. And you're right. As you look at the implied 2-year stacks, it is a significant outperformance versus pre-pandemic levels. And I'd really point to 2 things. You mentioned and Todd mentioned the retention of the new customers that came into the brand. And the other piece I would point to is the larger baskets, growing our baskets on top of basket growth last year.\n And so I think both of these are really enabled by the strategic initiatives. The strategic initiatives have really increased the relevance of Dollar General, providing a fuller fill in trip for bigger baskets. You can do more of your grocery shop, you can do more of your home shop on the nonconsumables side, purchase services as well as the broader appeal to these new customers. And I think also the initiatives really highlight and further enhance the unique combination of value and convenience that we bring to the consumer. That's what I see as the key drivers of that outperformance. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Recognizing that your multi-stack -- multiyear stacks are much more difficult than other retailers, your 1-year comps are trailing behind others, suggesting that you might be [ seeing ] some market share this year. Why do you think that is? And what actions do you need to take in order to reverse those market share trends? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, this is Todd. I would tell you that the way we've been looking at this all along this year has been on a 2-year stack basis, right? Because some of our laps are pretty difficult as you know, Michael. But we're happy with where our 2-year stacks are right now on market share. And quite frankly, in some of our key initiative categories like Fresh, it will outpace where we thought it would be on a market share basis.\n We're confident as we go forward that we'll continue to pick up market share at the same rate, if not accelerated as we move into 2022 and beyond, with all of the initiatives that we have. And keep in mind, that value and convenient message resonates across not only our core customer, but many different customer bases. And that is being preserved at all costs. Our pricing continues to be as good, if not -- was as good as I've seen it over the last few quarters and over the last few years. And as we continue to look out, we don't see that changing either. Promotional environment has been pretty tame.\n So when you put all that together, we feel that our market share gains will continue to move in a real positive manner with really, the same classes of trade being those donors as we continue to move into '22. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. And speaking of '22, you were helpful to provide a piece of the formula and the algorithm that you typically target. For next year, would you expect the same-store sales element to be in line with your typical 2% to 4% comp growth that's part of your long-term algorithm? Or given the stimulus roll off along with some of the other uncertainties out there, would you expect another year of below 2% to 4% before returning to that in 2023? \nJohn Garratt: Michael, this is John. I'll take the question. What I'll say is it's early to provide specific 2022 guidance, we'll do that on the next call. But as you think about next year, I would tell you, as we said in our prepared comments, we've never felt better about the business model. We feel great about the fundamentals and the initiatives as well as the performance of the real estate, including the new formats that further boost sales.\n As you think about headwinds and tailwinds for next year, I do -- and as you think about the cadence of the year, I would point to, as you noted in the first half, Q1, in particular, it's a difficult -- very difficult lap with stimulus. Certainly, that will be a tough lap, but again, I think we're well positioned with the initiatives and the value and convenience we bring to consumers when they need it most.\n And then also, as you think about next year in general, we come into the year with elevated inflationary pressures. We have, as we said, expectations that the supply chain costs will continue to be elevated through Q4, and they won't magically drop right out of the gate in Q1 as well as the product cost pressures. But we do think there's reasons to think that this is a supply and demand calculation here. And over time, it will moderate. And so that could flip as you move through the year into a tailwind.\n So more to come on the specifics. But as you think about next year, I would tell you the fundamentals are fantastic. But the beginning of the year will be more pressured than the latter part of the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I want to try the EBIT growth question a little differently. So -- for 4Q implied that is, versus 2019. So with the range of basically up 1% to up 14%, maybe just a little more color there. Because even if I back out your LIFO charge, you had a range of kind of 48% to 77% EBIT growth in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, depending on the quarter. So is this -- how much of this is an expectation on LIFO for 4Q versus supply chain versus maybe not passing on cost increases? And then I had a bigger picture question. \nJohn Garratt: I'll take that, Karen. If you look at -- obviously, there's a lot of year left, and it's a pretty dynamic environment. Certainly, there's uncertainties that creates -- that we thought it was prudent to keep the range wide, although narrowing it in half and taking the top half of our earnings and sales guidance. But as we looked at the key pressures and unknowns in Q4, certainly, supply chain remains elevated, and we expect that to remain elevated. And it's unclear as the pandemic continues to evolve, what that's going to mean specifically in terms of supply chain costs, but we do believe that's going to remain elevated as well as with the LIFO provision, that also is a pressure.\n What we have done is accrued year-to-date based on our projections of full year inflationary costs passed along to us by vendors. But certainly, that could change as well, although the team, I think, is doing a very good job of mitigating both. And I think compared to some of our peers, we've done quite well in terms of delivering year-to-date, the operating margin expansion. So it's really reflective of those key inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe are transitory in nature, but could still be volatile in the near term. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just maybe switching gears to unit opportunity. I guess maybe a little more color on why Mexico, maybe what makes the market attractive? Any color you could give on where your first stores will be and how the supply chain will work? And I guess I ask it also in the context of the fact that, as you point out, there's so much growth opportunity domestically. Do you really need to go into another -- or another country, I guess? \nTodd Vasos: Karen, this is Todd. We're really excited about that, the potential opportunity. And as you stated, we do have a lot of opportunity right here in the Continental United States. And you know us pretty well. I don't -- we won't take our eye off the ball on that. We are squarely committed, seeing 17,000 opportunities in the Continental United States to put a store between pOpshelf and Dollar General. That hasn't changed and nor has our focus on that.\n I think as you look at Mexico, the intriguing piece, there's a couple of things. Number one, as you know, going into another country, it's a little bit more complex than going into your 47 state as an example. So we started working on this well over a year ago. And it takes many years to cultivate this initiative. And as we indicated, up to 10 stores next year is fairly aggressive, but it will take us many years to build out Mexico, right? And with that thought, even though we've got so many opportunities here, why not start now was more our kind of thinking because it will take many years.\n We don't want to wait till we're down the road and need to move faster. We do everything pretty methodically here. And we feel that for sure, the right thing to do was to start working on it now, with the intent to put many locations down to Mexico. So where will we start? Well, we'll definitely start closer to home, if you will, that Northern Mexico feels right. So it will be probably more in that area. But it will open up as we continue to look at different opportunities as we go.\n And then distribution-wise, stay tuned. We're not quite ready to talk about all that. But as you can imagine, before you start putting a lot of distribution centers in Mexico, we'll need some more critical mass. So we're working that plan as we speak as well. We've got a lot of folks on board already. The team has done a great job using a term that we've been incorporated, if you will, in the country of Mexico. So we're now hiring and able to transact in Mexico. I think that's very important. And that's what we're doing right now and starting to look at how we build out that assortment and what it looks like.\n And stay tuned. We're excited, as you can probably tell in my voice, this is a real opportunity for us to continue to grow the brand and continue to move forward with Dollar General in different locations other than just the Continental United States. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Our first question was just on traffic. I know you mentioned in the prepared comments that it was sequentially better, but still down. We were wondering your thoughts on that, is it something that got better throughout the quarter? And have you seen any meaningful change in traffic in the last few weeks, given the latest variant news? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. This is Todd. Yes, the traffic number continues to be a little bit soft. But I would tell you that it definitely has been -- it's sequentially better than it was when you look from Q2 to Q3. And as you continue to think about our core consumer, and this is what's so important to continue always to keep in mind, when times are good for her and she has more money, she tends to come less often and spend more. What we've seen in our basket continue to be pretty strong throughout. And so that always happens with our core customer in better times economically for her, and that's what she's seen. \n And then as things switch, if they start to switch, then you'll see her come more often and spend less. So those smaller baskets tend to then grow and that traffic number tends to pick up. We're squarely focused on it. We're not -- we're definitely not happy with traffic overall because we love to see positive, but we understand the drivers and the reasons. And we'll make sure that as things continue to progress, that we're squarely focused on driving traffic and price and convenience is our big mantra, and we'll continue to make sure that both of those are well intact for our core consumer. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And I just want to ask one question on pOpshelf. You had mentioned several times, it's exceeding expectations. We were just wondering if there were certain merchandise categories that have been stronger than expected. And just what the quarter looked like for this concept, given the majority of what you're selling is discretionary? \nJeffery Owen: Thanks, Kate. This is Jeff. And you're right, we are excited about pOpshelf, and we continue to be very, very pleased with how our customers are responding really to the entire box. And very excited that we're going to triple the store count in 2022 and laying the groundwork for 1,000 stores by 2025. So I think you can tell by our bullish news and our excitement, just how excited we are with what the customer is telling us.\n When you think about the store in general, there's many areas that she is gravitating towards and responding well. And quite frankly, there's more than we have time to talk about. But I would tell you right now, certainly, we love what she's seeing around the toys that we've offered, we've got great -- in the home area, she's really finding ways. When you think about it, the majority -- over 90% of our items are less than $5. She's really finding ways that she can treat herself and has a lot of fun in the shopping environment.\n And so the team continues. We're just getting started here. We'll get better and better and better. But right now, that concept is really, really performing great, and we're really excited about how it's going to complement the traditional Dollar General network as we move forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I also had a few questions on the pOpshelf concept. So first, as you look at the pOpshelf acceleration, how does that impact your longer-term algorithm? And then secondly, as you look at the pOpshelf in-store concept, just curious how you guys think about that in the coming years? \nJohn Garratt: I'll take the first part of that question, Rupesh. I think it's important to note, and Todd touched on this in his prepared comments, that as we look at pOpshelf, we see this as additive to our Dollar General banner growth plans. And the other thing we've noted is we see over time, as many as 3,000 additional store opportunities from this, incremental to the 13,000 DG banner opportunities. We're accelerating it rapidly, effectively tripling the number of stores next year as we add 100 on top of 50, and then look to have 1,000 by the end of 2025.\n So as you think of the algorithm going forward, I don't want to give any specific long-term guidance at this point, but I think it's important to note that it is additive. As you look at next year, the 100 is additive on top of the 1,000 DG stores, and that's the way we look at that going forward. While in the near term, you do have start-up costs that offset the near-term benefits, but when you look at the fantastic unit level economics of these stores, and we've talked about these, $1.7 million to $2 million sales margins that we see as 40% and growing over time. It's just fantastic unit level economics that we anticipate and fully expect to be increasingly accretive to operating profit long term as we scale it. \nJeffery Owen: And Rupesh, I'll talk about the store-within-a-store concept that you mentioned, like pOpshelf, we're very excited about what we're seeing here as well. This is obviously very new here, just been in stores just a few months. But very pleased with what we're seeing again from the customer. And when you think about this store-within-a-store concept, really what it is able to do is it takes about 70% to 80% of the pOpshelf assortment and right inside this Dollar General Market. \n And so the store-within-a-store, as you look forward, will continue, as we mentioned earlier, to expand that. But as we think about the long term here, we recently announced a larger square foot store format, which we've talked about, pleased with that productivity. But again, things like that give us the opportunity to create enough theater to perhaps bring some of that merchandise into the broader assortment of the Dollar General network. So we'll have to wait and see long term as we look forward, but the team is continuing to refine and look at ways that we can continue to learn from this store-within-a-store just like we learned from NCI and how it really was the genesis for pOpshelf to begin. \n So more to come, but very pleased with the store-within-a-store concept and our ability to grow that over time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Can you talk about what you tend to see when a drug store closes in your trade area? Any quantification of any lift that a nearby DG store might get? \n And then second, just one follow-up on pOpshelf. I was curious about the geographic rollout. Is that going to be kind of concentrated as you think about next year's openings? Or more spread throughout the country? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. This is Todd. I'll take that. If you think about the drugstore business, the drug business has been our biggest donor of share over the many years, we've been very vocal about that. And with our health initiatives, we continue to gain more and more share from consumers around health and beauty in general. And so when any competitor, as you can imagine, goes out in the marketplace, it does -- it gives us an opportunity to garner more share in that area.\n Drugstores tend to exist, if you will, in areas that have multiple competitors in them. And that normally spreads out across many competitors. But we're squarely focused on anytime, just gaining share and any opportunity. So we'll continue to watch that very, very carefully. But we believe we're in great position just overall to continue to capitalize on health and beauty in general. \n And then on the pOpshelf question, we'll continue to look -- call it, Southern Midwest to that Southeast is really where we're focused on right now, early on. Mid-Atlantic to a degree too, if you think about Mid-Atlantic being that Virginia type area down into the Carolinas. Those are the areas right now we're focused on. But over time, we see this across the United States as an opportunity. So we won't be limited to certain geographical areas.\n But as we always do, we're very methodical in our rollout. We want to make sure that we're able to supply the goods we need timely and warehouse is important. The great thing about how we've set our warehousing up with this is it's integrated with Dollar General. So we strip all the costs out of that. And we use the mother ship as we talk about the Dollar General mother ship, the brand not only in distribution but in so many different back-of-the-house areas, where we can make this very, very accretive, as John talked about, over the years as we grow the pOpshelf brand. \nOperator: Next question comes from Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: I was just wondering if there were any notable patterns or anything that you could point out to as it relates to performance of rural stores versus some of your urban stores in the quarter? And then also, I guess, with the implied 2-year stack in the fourth quarter, pointing to a potential reacceleration, where do you see the greatest opportunity to start to take back market share? \nJeffery Owen: I'll take the first part. This is Jeff. And when you talk about the geographic footprint of our stores, first of all, we're pleased with the balance in terms of our sales performance, and that's one of the real beautiful things about this company is, is just how evenly distributed and how well the company is performing across all geographic. \n When you think about the rural, earlier in the pandemic, we did see outsized performance in our rural stores. But it's beginning to normalize where it traditionally has performed, where we continue to perform better in rural, but not to the same degree from a disparity standpoint that we saw early in the pandemic. So as things open up, we're seeing performance open up just like we would expect across all of our store base.\n So generally speaking, we're very pleased with really, the performance across all of our geographic regions and the demographic regions. So real pleased with what we're seeing there. \nTodd Vasos: And on the second part of the question, yes, we anticipate as things start to level out in '22. As John indicated, Q1, we still got a pretty big lap with stimulus and other things, the pandemic still in swing in 2021 as we move into '22 early. But as things start to level out as we get into '22 and into mid -- the back end of '22, we believe that the market share gains will probably continue to come from those same areas that were there prior to the pandemic.\n And so when you think about it, it's almost against all classes of trade, but definitely, drug being one of the larger [ share owners ] over time. And again, as I indicated earlier, that won't change. We believe that will continue, and will probably accelerate as we continue our initiatives around health and beauty and our health initiatives in general services and such in the years to come. So we feel good about being lined up nicely for market share gains, but we're squarely focused right now on ending Q4 on a high note and moving into 2022. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'll wrap up things by saying we're very pleased with the third quarter results, which I think speaks to our strategy, our culture, and the great execution by our team, even in a constantly evolving environment.\n As we look forward, I'm very optimistic about our robust set of initiatives, including today's announcements to accelerate the pace of new unit growth at pOpshelf and expand internationally for the first time. As I said earlier, I never have felt better about the underlying business model. And in fact, I believe this is a much different company than it was just a few years ago and that we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us.\n Thank you for listening. Have a great day and a happy holiday. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to meeting the needs of our customers, communities and each other.  \n Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, including elevated cost pressures and broad-based supply chain disruptions, our teams remained focused on controlling what we can control and they are delivering for our customers. We are grateful for their efforts. \n Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment. And although we've experienced higher-than-expected costs, both from a product and supply chain perspective, we're very confident in our price position as our price indexes relative to our competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And because so many families depend on us for everyday essentials, at the right price, we believe products at the $1 price point are important for our customers, and they will continue to have a significant presence in our assortment. In fact, approximately 20% of our overall assortment remains at $1 or less. And moving forward, we will continue to foster and grow this program where appropriate. \n As the largest retailer in the U.S. by store count, with over 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe our presence in local communities across the country provides another distinct advantage and positions us well for continued success. Overall, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position, while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. \n To that end, I'm excited to share an update on some of our more recent plans. First, as you saw in our release, we expect to execute a total of nearly 3,000 real estate projects in 2022, including 1,100 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. Of note, these plans include the acceleration of our pOpshelf concept, as we expect to nearly triple our store count next year as compared to our fiscal '21 year-end target of up to 50 locations. In addition, given the sustained performance of our pOpshelf concept, which continues to exceed our expectations, we plan to further accelerate the pace of new store openings as we move ahead, targeting a total of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by fiscal year-end 2025. Importantly, we anticipate these new pOpshelf locations will be incremental to our annual Dollar General store opening plans as we look to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see for both brands. \n We are also now at the early stages of plans to extend our footprint into Mexico, which will represent our first store locations outside the Continental United States. We believe Mexico represents a compelling expansion opportunity for Dollar General, given its demographics and proximity to the U.S., and we are confident that our unique value and convenience proposition will resonate with the Mexican consumer. While our initial entry into Mexico is focused on piloting a small number of stores in 2022, we expect the seeds we plant today will ultimately turn into additional growth opportunities in the future. \n Finally, as previously announced, we recently introduced our digital services by partnering with DoorDash to provide delivery in under an hour in over 10,000 locations, further enhancing our convenience proposition while broadening our reach with new customers. Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first, let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. \n Net sales increased 3.9% to $8.5 billion, following a 17.3% increase in Q3 of 2020. Comp sales declined 0.6% to the prior year quarter, which translates to a robust 11.6% increase on a 2-year stack basis. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in September, with October being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 sales to date are trending in line with our expectations. Our third quarter sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was largely offset by growth in average basket size, even as we lapped significant growth in average basket size last year. \n In addition, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q2 of 2021, and we continue to be pleased with the retention of the new customers acquired in 2020. We're also pleased with the market share gains as measured by syndicated data in our frozen and refrigerated product categories. And even as our market share in total highly consumable product sales decreased slightly in Q3, we feel good about our overall share gains on a 2-year stack basis. \n Collectively, our third quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts and further validates our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we continue to lay the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. \n Overall, I've never felt better about the underlying business model, and we are excited about the significant growth opportunities we see ahead. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Simeon, it's Todd. I would tell you that our core consumer continues to be in pretty good shape. You're 100% right that a lot of the stimulus money has now dissipated. But I've always said, and our core customer has always said, as long as she is gainfully employed, that is probably the biggest driver of her confidence to spend. And there is no doubt that she is gainfully employed right now and can work as many hours as she may or may not want to. But as we look through the remainder of this year and into next, we believe that she'll continue to be gainfully employed. And with that, will have money to spend. \n And then the other thing to think about with this low-cost consumer, to your point, we continue to show great value, right? When you look at how we operate, our pricing is as good as ever against all classes of trade. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're not walking away from a $1 price point. We believe that's so important to her as we continue to move forward. Not that we believe it, she tells us that each and every day. So I think that value and convenience message will continue to resonate with our core consumer. Thanks for the question, Matt. As you know, right, we put out a range and we definitely see that the consumer is still shopping at a pretty good rate. But I would tell you there's a lot of the quarter left. So let's make sure we temper that just a bit. But the great thing about Dollar General is that we have never taken our eye off the ball on what that consumer is looking for. And that gives us that confidence as we move through this year and into next on our ability to continue to service that consumer and if there is any trade down that tends to come in that, that consumer will also enjoy those benefits.\n And then lastly, we still are very positive on the trade-down consumer that came in during the pandemic or trade-in is probably a better term for it. And those numbers continue to exceed our expectation on retention rate. So we've got that moving through the fourth quarter and into next year as well. So with all that high end of the guidance is very attainable. But on the other side, we've got a lot of quarter left and that's why we give you that nice range. Yes, this is Todd. I would tell you that the way we've been looking at this all along this year has been on a 2-year stack basis, right? Because some of our laps are pretty difficult as you know, Michael. But we're happy with where our 2-year stacks are right now on market share. And quite frankly, in some of our key initiative categories like Fresh, it will outpace where we thought it would be on a market share basis.\n We're confident as we go forward that we'll continue to pick up market share at the same rate, if not accelerated as we move into 2022 and beyond, with all of the initiatives that we have. And keep in mind, that value and convenient message resonates across not only our core customer, but many different customer bases. And that is being preserved at all costs. Our pricing continues to be as good, if not -- was as good as I've seen it over the last few quarters and over the last few years. And as we continue to look out, we don't see that changing either. Promotional environment has been pretty tame.\n So when you put all that together, we feel that our market share gains will continue to move in a real positive manner with really, the same classes of trade being those donors as we continue to move into '22. Karen, this is Todd. We're really excited about that, the potential opportunity. And as you stated, we do have a lot of opportunity right here in the Continental United States. And you know us pretty well. I don't -- we won't take our eye off the ball on that. We are squarely committed, seeing 17,000 opportunities in the Continental United States to put a store between pOpshelf and Dollar General. That hasn't changed and nor has our focus on that.\n I think as you look at Mexico, the intriguing piece, there's a couple of things. Number one, as you know, going into another country, it's a little bit more complex than going into your 47 state as an example. So we started working on this well over a year ago. And it takes many years to cultivate this initiative. And as we indicated, up to 10 stores next year is fairly aggressive, but it will take us many years to build out Mexico, right? And with that thought, even though we've got so many opportunities here, why not start now was more our kind of thinking because it will take many years.\n We don't want to wait till we're down the road and need to move faster. We do everything pretty methodically here. And we feel that for sure, the right thing to do was to start working on it now, with the intent to put many locations down to Mexico. So where will we start? Well, we'll definitely start closer to home, if you will, that Northern Mexico feels right. So it will be probably more in that area. But it will open up as we continue to look at different opportunities as we go.\n And then distribution-wise, stay tuned. We're not quite ready to talk about all that. But as you can imagine, before you start putting a lot of distribution centers in Mexico, we'll need some more critical mass. So we're working that plan as we speak as well. We've got a lot of folks on board already. The team has done a great job using a term that we've been incorporated, if you will, in the country of Mexico. So we're now hiring and able to transact in Mexico. I think that's very important. And that's what we're doing right now and starting to look at how we build out that assortment and what it looks like.\n And stay tuned. We're excited, as you can probably tell in my voice, this is a real opportunity for us to continue to grow the brand and continue to move forward with Dollar General in different locations other than just the Continental United States. Yes. This is Todd. Yes, the traffic number continues to be a little bit soft. But I would tell you that it definitely has been -- it's sequentially better than it was when you look from Q2 to Q3. And as you continue to think about our core consumer, and this is what's so important to continue always to keep in mind, when times are good for her and she has more money, she tends to come less often and spend more. What we've seen in our basket continue to be pretty strong throughout. And so that always happens with our core customer in better times economically for her, and that's what she's seen. \n And then as things switch, if they start to switch, then you'll see her come more often and spend less. So those smaller baskets tend to then grow and that traffic number tends to pick up. We're squarely focused on it. We're not -- we're definitely not happy with traffic overall because we love to see positive, but we understand the drivers and the reasons. And we'll make sure that as things continue to progress, that we're squarely focused on driving traffic and price and convenience is our big mantra, and we'll continue to make sure that both of those are well intact for our core consumer. Yes. This is Todd. I'll take that. If you think about the drugstore business, the drug business has been our biggest donor of share over the many years, we've been very vocal about that. And with our health initiatives, we continue to gain more and more share from consumers around health and beauty in general. And so when any competitor, as you can imagine, goes out in the marketplace, it does -- it gives us an opportunity to garner more share in that area.\n Drugstores tend to exist, if you will, in areas that have multiple competitors in them. And that normally spreads out across many competitors. But we're squarely focused on anytime, just gaining share and any opportunity. So we'll continue to watch that very, very carefully. But we believe we're in great position just overall to continue to capitalize on health and beauty in general. \n And then on the pOpshelf question, we'll continue to look -- call it, Southern Midwest to that Southeast is really where we're focused on right now, early on. Mid-Atlantic to a degree too, if you think about Mid-Atlantic being that Virginia type area down into the Carolinas. Those are the areas right now we're focused on. But over time, we see this across the United States as an opportunity. So we won't be limited to certain geographical areas.\n But as we always do, we're very methodical in our rollout. We want to make sure that we're able to supply the goods we need timely and warehouse is important. The great thing about how we've set our warehousing up with this is it's integrated with Dollar General. So we strip all the costs out of that.

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit.  \n As a reminder, gross profit in Q3 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 24% in our combined non-consumable categories. For Q3 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.8%, a decrease of 57 basis points but an increase of 121 basis points compared to Q3 2019. The decrease compared to Q3 2020 was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, increased transportation costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.9%, an increase of 105 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales in the current year period, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs. The quarter also included $16 million of disaster-related expenses attributable to Hurricane Ida. \n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the third quarter decreased 13.9% to $665.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 162 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement of 78 basis points compared to Q3 2019. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and compares to 21.6% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for Q3 decreased 10% to $2.08, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 21% over a 2-year period. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 5.4% overall and a decrease of 0.1% on a per store basis. And while we're not satisfied with our overall in-stock levels, we continue to make good progress and are focused on improving our in-stock position, particularly in our consumables business. Looking ahead, we are pleased with our inventory position for the holiday shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of goods for the remainder of the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $2.2 billion. \n Capital expenditures through the first 3 quarters were $779 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $360 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $97 million. At the end of Q3, the total remaining authorization for future repurchases was $619 million. We announced today that our Board has increased its authorization by $2 billion. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including any changes in consumer behavior and the corresponding impacts on our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including cost inflation and ongoing pressure throughout the supply chain, we are updating our sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong performance through the first 3 quarters as well as our expectations for Q4. \n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 1% to 1.5%; a same-store sales decline of approximately 3% to 2.5%, but which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 22% to 24% or approximately 21% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Finally, our expectations for capital spending, share repurchases and real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on August 26, 2021. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our outlook over the next couple of months, given the continued uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional supply chain disruptions and the impact of the end of certain federal aid, such as additional unemployment benefits and stimulus payments. \n Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rate. Consistent with Q2 and Q3, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter due to a higher LIFO provision as a result of cost of goods increases, a less favorable sales mix compared to the prior year quarter and an increase in markdown rates as we continue to cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020.  \n We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in Q4 compared to the 2020 period. Like other retailers, our business continues to be impacted by higher costs due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures. \n With regards to SG&A, we continue to expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives. This amount includes $56 million in incremental investments made during the first 3 quarters of 2021. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.  \n Finally, our updated guidance does not include any impact from the proposed federal vaccine and testing mandate, including potential disruptions to the business or labor market or any incremental expense. \n In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, which are a testament to the strong performance and execution by the team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. No, nothing incremental in terms of investments. We noted the $70 million, $80 million of investments in the strategic initiatives, which again are accretive overall. And then the other thing we pointed out is just on the gross margin. You certainly have a continued pressure that we anticipate, associated with the supply chain, which, again, we believe that's transitory in nature. It's a supply and demand issue, but we saw that increase as we went into -- from Q2 to Q3, and we expect that to remain elevated year-over-year as we look at Q4.\n And then obviously, the other big piece here is inflation. We're seeing higher prices passed along from vendors, and that's showing up in terms of the LIFO provision, which we noted. But that's really the key drivers I would point to on a 2-year basis. And then on a 1-year basis, I would just point to the very difficult lap as we're lapping extremely high sales of nonconsumable goods, which have a higher margin as well as unusually low markdowns around clearance items, just given the extremely high sell-through last year. You're right, Matt. This is John. And you're right. As you look at the implied 2-year stacks, it is a significant outperformance versus pre-pandemic levels. And I'd really point to 2 things. You mentioned and Todd mentioned the retention of the new customers that came into the brand. And the other piece I would point to is the larger baskets, growing our baskets on top of basket growth last year.\n And so I think both of these are really enabled by the strategic initiatives. The strategic initiatives have really increased the relevance of Dollar General, providing a fuller fill in trip for bigger baskets. You can do more of your grocery shop, you can do more of your home shop on the nonconsumables side, purchase services as well as the broader appeal to these new customers. And I think also the initiatives really highlight and further enhance the unique combination of value and convenience that we bring to the consumer. That's what I see as the key drivers of that outperformance. Michael, this is John. I'll take the question. What I'll say is it's early to provide specific 2022 guidance, we'll do that on the next call. But as you think about next year, I would tell you, as we said in our prepared comments, we've never felt better about the business model. We feel great about the fundamentals and the initiatives as well as the performance of the real estate, including the new formats that further boost sales.\n As you think about headwinds and tailwinds for next year, I do -- and as you think about the cadence of the year, I would point to, as you noted in the first half, Q1, in particular, it's a difficult -- very difficult lap with stimulus. Certainly, that will be a tough lap, but again, I think we're well positioned with the initiatives and the value and convenience we bring to consumers when they need it most.\n And then also, as you think about next year in general, we come into the year with elevated inflationary pressures. We have, as we said, expectations that the supply chain costs will continue to be elevated through Q4, and they won't magically drop right out of the gate in Q1 as well as the product cost pressures. But we do think there's reasons to think that this is a supply and demand calculation here. And over time, it will moderate. And so that could flip as you move through the year into a tailwind.\n So more to come on the specifics. But as you think about next year, I would tell you the fundamentals are fantastic. But the beginning of the year will be more pressured than the latter part of the year. I'll take that, Karen. If you look at -- obviously, there's a lot of year left, and it's a pretty dynamic environment. Certainly, there's uncertainties that creates -- that we thought it was prudent to keep the range wide, although narrowing it in half and taking the top half of our earnings and sales guidance. But as we looked at the key pressures and unknowns in Q4, certainly, supply chain remains elevated, and we expect that to remain elevated. And it's unclear as the pandemic continues to evolve, what that's going to mean specifically in terms of supply chain costs, but we do believe that's going to remain elevated as well as with the LIFO provision, that also is a pressure.\n What we have done is accrued year-to-date based on our projections of full year inflationary costs passed along to us by vendors. But certainly, that could change as well, although the team, I think, is doing a very good job of mitigating both. And I think compared to some of our peers, we've done quite well in terms of delivering year-to-date, the operating margin expansion. So it's really reflective of those key inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe are transitory in nature, but could still be volatile in the near term. I'll take the first part of that question, Rupesh. I think it's important to note, and Todd touched on this in his prepared comments, that as we look at pOpshelf, we see this as additive to our Dollar General banner growth plans. And the other thing we've noted is we see over time, as many as 3,000 additional store opportunities from this, incremental to the 13,000 DG banner opportunities. We're accelerating it rapidly, effectively tripling the number of stores next year as we add 100 on top of 50, and then look to have 1,000 by the end of 2025.\n So as you think of the algorithm going forward, I don't want to give any specific long-term guidance at this point, but I think it's important to note that it is additive. As you look at next year, the 100 is additive on top of the 1,000 DG stores, and that's the way we look at that going forward. While in the near term, you do have start-up costs that offset the near-term benefits, but when you look at the fantastic unit level economics of these stores, and we've talked about these, $1.7 million to $2 million sales margins that we see as 40% and growing over time. It's just fantastic unit level economics that we anticipate and fully expect to be increasingly accretive to operating profit long term as we scale it."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a great job this quarter executing against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. \n Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. The NCI offering was available in nearly 11,000 stores at the end of Q3 and we continue to be very pleased with the strong performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. Notably, this performance is contributing an incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase on average and NCI stores, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we now plan to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,500 stores by year-end, including over 2,000 stores in our light version and we expect to complete the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022.  \n Moving to our pOpshelf concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a unique in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we added 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 30, opened our first 14 store-within-a-store concepts and celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first pOpshelf store opening. \n For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger format Dollar General Market stores. Importantly, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our pOpshelf stores, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin. In fact, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for our current locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. We believe this bodes well for the future as we move towards our goal of about 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in Q2 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing as DG Fresh remains a meaningful contributor to our gross margin rate. \n Another goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are very happy with the performance on this front as overall comp sales of our frozen and refrigerated goods outperformed all other product categories in Q3, even against the difficult prior year sales comparison. Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors  and associated sales. \n With regards to our cooler expansion program, during the first 3 quarters, we added more than 52,000 cooler doors across our store base. In total, we expect to install approximately 65,000 additional cooler doors in 2021, the majority of which will be in high-capacity coolers. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of about 30% more feet of selling space and nearly 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 800 stores at the end of Q3, with plans to expand to approximately 1,000 stores by year-end. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink. Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We recently celebrated a significant milestone with the opening of our 18,000th store, which reflects the fantastic work of our best-in-class real estate team as we continue to expand our footprint and further enhance our ability to serve additional customers. \n Through the first 3 quarters, we completed a total of 2,386 real estate projects, including 798 new stores, 1,506 remodels and 82 relocations. For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. In addition, we now have produce in approximately 1,900 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of over 2,000 stores by year-end. For 2022, we plan to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. We also plan to add produce in approximately 1,000 additional stores next year, with the goal of ultimately expanding this offering to a total of up to 10,000 stores over time. \n Of note, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot new store prototype, allowing for a more optimal assortment and room to accommodate future growth. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend about 15% above an average traditional store. Our 2022 real estate plans also include opening approximately 100 additional pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 150 by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts. \n As Todd noted, we are also very excited about our plans to expand our footprint internationally for the first time, with plans to open up to 10 stores in Mexico by year-end 2022 as we look to extend our value and convenience offering to even more communities, while continuing to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. And the good news is we believe we still have a long runway for new unit growth ahead of us. \n In fact, across our Dollar General, pOpshelf and DGX format types, we estimate there are approximately 17,000 new store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States alone. Although these opportunities are available to all small box retailers, we expect to continue capturing a disproportionate share as we move forward. And while still early, we expect our entry into Mexico will ultimately unlock a significant number of additional new unit opportunities in the years to come. When taken together, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical store footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for our customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. Of note, we ended Q3 with over 4.4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n As Todd noted, our partnership with DoorDash is another example of meeting the evolving needs of our customers by providing the savings offered by Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. And while still early, we are pleased with the initial results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n Our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, is also seeing strong results, including significant growth in the number of campaigns on our platform. Overall, we remain very excited about the long-term growth potential of this business, and we look to better connect our brand partners with our customers in a way that is accretive to the customer experience.\n Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement across our digital ecosystem.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.\n The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Looking ahead, our plans now include expanding this offering to over 6,000 stores by year-end 2021 and to the majority of our store base by the end of 2022 as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, in 2022, we plan to create more than 8,000 net new jobs. In addition, our growth also fosters an environment, where employees have opportunities to advance to roles with increasing levels of responsibility and meaningful wage growth and a relatively short time frame. In fact, over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we offer our teams. \n Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by our robust promotion pipeline, healthy applicant flows and staffing above traditional levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n We also recently completed our annual community giving campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people. Our mission of serving others is deeply embedded in the daily culture at Dollar General, and I am so proud to be a part of such an incredible team.\n In closing, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. And with the actions and multiyear initiatives we have in place, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation. As we are in the midst of a truly unique and busy holiday season, I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 162,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thanks, Kate. This is Jeff. And you're right, we are excited about pOpshelf, and we continue to be very, very pleased with how our customers are responding really to the entire box. And very excited that we're going to triple the store count in 2022 and laying the groundwork for 1,000 stores by 2025. So I think you can tell by our bullish news and our excitement, just how excited we are with what the customer is telling us.\n When you think about the store in general, there's many areas that she is gravitating towards and responding well. And quite frankly, there's more than we have time to talk about. But I would tell you right now, certainly, we love what she's seeing around the toys that we've offered, we've got great -- in the home area, she's really finding ways. When you think about it, the majority -- over 90% of our items are less than $5. She's really finding ways that she can treat herself and has a lot of fun in the shopping environment.\n And so the team continues. We're just getting started here. We'll get better and better and better. But right now, that concept is really, really performing great, and we're really excited about how it's going to complement the traditional Dollar General network as we move forward. And Rupesh, I'll talk about the store-within-a-store concept that you mentioned, like pOpshelf, we're very excited about what we're seeing here as well. This is obviously very new here, just been in stores just a few months. But very pleased with what we're seeing again from the customer. And when you think about this store-within-a-store concept, really what it is able to do is it takes about 70% to 80% of the pOpshelf assortment and right inside this Dollar General Market. \n And so the store-within-a-store, as you look forward, will continue, as we mentioned earlier, to expand that. But as we think about the long term here, we recently announced a larger square foot store format, which we've talked about, pleased with that productivity. But again, things like that give us the opportunity to create enough theater to perhaps bring some of that merchandise into the broader assortment of the Dollar General network. So we'll have to wait and see long term as we look forward, but the team is continuing to refine and look at ways that we can continue to learn from this store-within-a-store just like we learned from NCI and how it really was the genesis for pOpshelf to begin. \n So more to come, but very pleased with the store-within-a-store concept and our ability to grow that over time. I'll take the first part. This is Jeff. And when you talk about the geographic footprint of our stores, first of all, we're pleased with the balance in terms of our sales performance, and that's one of the real beautiful things about this company is, is just how evenly distributed and how well the company is performing across all geographic. \n When you think about the rural, earlier in the pandemic, we did see outsized performance in our rural stores. But it's beginning to normalize where it traditionally has performed, where we continue to perform better in rural, but not to the same degree from a disparity standpoint that we saw early in the pandemic. So as things open up, we're seeing performance open up just like we would expect across all of our store base.\n So generally speaking, we're very pleased with really, the performance across all of our geographic regions and the demographic regions. So real pleased with what we're seeing there."

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results and continue to be grateful to our associates for their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. Despite what remains a challenging operating environment, including additional uncertainties brought on by the Delta variant and pressures on the global supply chain, our teams continue to successfully adapt and deliver for our customers. Because of their efforts, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q1 and once again, increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and believe we are well positioned to navigate the current inflationary environment and global supply chain challenges. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers is our primary focus, while meeting the needs of the communities we serve. And with more than 17,500 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience.\n To that end, we recently hired our first Chief Medical Officer. Going forward, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to affordable health care products and services, particularly in rural America. Overall, we remain focused on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\n Turning now to our second quarter performance. As we continue to lap difficult quarterly sales comparisons from the prior year, net sales decreased 0.4% to $8.7 billion, followed by a 24.4% increase in Q2 of 2020. Comp sales declined 4.7% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 14.1% increase on a 2-year stack basis. Our Q2 sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by the growth in average basket size. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in May, with July being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q3 is off to a great start.\n Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We believe we will ultimately exit the pandemic with a larger, broader and more engaged customer base than when we entered it, resulting in an even stronger foundation from which to grow. Overall, our second quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts as we continue to strengthen our position while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock significant growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying strength of the business, and we're confident we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balanced and sustainable growth by creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q2 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 41% in our combined nonconsumables categories. For Q2 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, a decrease of 80 basis points, but an increase of 87 basis points compared to Q2 2019. The decrease compared to Q2 2020 was primarily attributable to: increased transportation costs, a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable categories and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction shrink as a percentage of sales.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.8%, an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs.\n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the second quarter decreased 18.5% to $849.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.8%, a decrease of 219 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement in our profitability on a 2-year basis. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% and compares to 21.5% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the second quarter decreased 13.8% to $2.69, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% or 24.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 20% overall and 13.7% on a per store basis as we continue to cycle unusually low levels of inventory in Q2 2020, which were driven by extremely strong sales volumes in that quarter.\n Similar to Q1, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories in anticipation of longer lead times. As a result, we were pleased with our strong inventory position for the back-to-school shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of seasonal and other goods in the remaining back half of the year.\n Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.3 billion. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $518 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $98 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $979 million.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of about 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021, we continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economic recovery, global supply chain, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including additional pressure throughout the supply chain and cost inflation, we are updating our full year sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong first half performance.\n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales growth of 0.5 point to 1.5 points; a same-store sales decline of 3.5% to 2.5%, which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.60 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 20% to 24% or approximately 19% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Our expectations for real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on May 27, 2021.\n With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $2.2 billion. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2021 to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion to reflect higher equipment costs for store projects and the pull forward of select supply chain investments.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our 2021 outlook, given the current continued uncertainties arising from COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the expected end of additional federal unemployment benefits.\n Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates. Much like our Q2 results, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the second half due to a less favorable sales mix compared to prior year, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020 and higher LIFO provisions as a result of cost of goods increases.\n We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in the second half compared to our previous expectations. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effects of higher cost due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, our team was able to meet strong customer demand during the quarter, and we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures.\n Finally, please keep in mind that the third quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following an improvement of 178 basis points in Q3 2020. With regards to SG&A, we now expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. This amount includes $40 million in incremental investments made during the first half of the year. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n In closing, we are proud of our second quarter results, which are a testament to the performance and strong execution by the entire team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team continues to drive strong execution against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of our more recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative or NCI. The NCI offering was available in more than 8,800 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 1% to 2.5% total comp sales increase in NCI stores and a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, with the goal of completing the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022.\n Moving to our newer store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 8 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 16, including 4 conversions of a traditional Dollar General store into our pOpshelf concept. And while still early, we remain extremely pleased with our results, which continue to exceed our expectations for both sales and gross margin.\n We also recently opened our first 2 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger Dollar General market stores, and we're encouraged by the initial results, including positive reaction from customers. For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts as we continue to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and are now delivering to more than 17,500 stores from 12 facilities. This important milestone is a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication of the team, and I want to thank them for their incredible execution over the past 2.5 years. Notably, the rollout was completed about 6 months ahead of our initial rollout schedule.\n As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher inventory markups, and we expect additional benefits going forward as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of additional products, including both national and private brands. For example, we recently introduced about 25 new and exclusive items under the Armour brand as we continue to optimize our assortment while further differentiating our product offering from others. And while produce was not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh provides a potential path to accelerating our produce offering in up to 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.\n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first half, we added more than 34,000 cooler doors across our store base and remain on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin-enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 772 real estate projects, including 270 new stores, 477 remodels and 25 relocations. For the full year, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,500 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 2,000 stores by year-end.\n As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing our larger 8,500 square foot format as our base prototype for nearly all new stores going forward. We're especially pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend well above an average traditional store. In total, we expect to have nearly 2,000 stores in this format by the end of the year as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app, which continues to grow in popularity. In fact, we ended Q2 with nearly 4 million monthly active users on the app, a 28% increase over prior year.\n Importantly, as we continue to drive higher levels of digital engagement, our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, has become an increasingly more relevant platform for connecting our brand partners with our customers. Of note, during the first half, the number of campaigns on our platform increased 65% compared to the prior year period, and we are very excited about the growth potential of this business as we look to further enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset.\n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of optimizing our rolltainers and case pack sizes, resulting in the more efficient stocking of our stores.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates and higher overall satisfaction scores in stores that include this offering. Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we remain focused on introducing self-checkout into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail.\n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, we recently launched a national hiring event with the goal of hiring up to an additional 50,000 employees by Labor Day, and I am pleased to note that we are on track to meet our goal.\n We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. And because over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, employees who joined Dollar General know they have an opportunity to grow their career with us.\n We also continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as pOpshelf. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by a robust internal promotion pipeline and staffing above traditional levels. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, resulting in a rich and virtual development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This is one of my favorite events every year, and I was once again inspired by the incredible talent and dedication of our people.\n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance as we continue to advance our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Overall, we are very pleased with our position as we head into the back half of the year, and I'm excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 159,000 employees across the company for their unwavering commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So Todd, I wanted to go back to one of the comments you made in the script. You said Q3 is off to a good start -- or great start, you said. Any more color you can provide in terms of what you guys are seeing? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Rupesh, we are happy with the way Q3 started out. Back-to-school is doing very well for us. We got all of our products that we anticipated getting from overseas as well as domestically. And the consumer has a little extra money in their pocket. So as evidenced by our guidance in the back half, we feel pretty good about our sales line as we go forward. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up just on the gross margin line for John. Any more color you can provide in terms of the puts and takes to think about on the gross margin line in the back half of the year? And then if you look at the distribution of freight pressures, would you expect them to persist into next year? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. So in terms of gross margin, and I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the performance, up 62 basis points year-to-date. While down 80 basis points in Q2, were up 87 basis points over Q2 2019 as we continue to see initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI and others really contributing. But like with our Q2 results, we do expect some continued pressure on gross margin in the second half due primarily to inflation, which we believe to be transitory, but related to higher transportation costs, higher than previously expected. Of course, we're seeing elevated demand with the great sales, and that's resulting in some transportation and supply capacity challenges with our third-party carriers.\n And then on top of that, we did mention a higher LIFO provision as a result of product cost increases. Some others have seen similar inflation and pass some of that along. And then, of course, we have a very challenging lap as we talked about with the year-over-year mix. In Q2, we lapped 40% nonconsumable sales. And so while nonconsumable business is still doing fabulously, it's a very difficult lap in the back half. And certainly, you have a very favorable last year mix profile with that mix. And then you also had unusually low clearance activity associated with nonconsumables on that high sell-through.\n So while we expect to continue to do well, it provides a challenging lap. So a difficult lap near-term inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe to be transitory. But as you look ahead, we believe still, that with the growing benefit from initiatives, with all the levers at our disposal between private brands, foreign sourcing, shrink, supply chain efficiencies as we get through the near-term pressures and of course, category management and of course, our scale, we believe we're in a great position to continue to expand margins over the long term and believe we're in a great spot right now in terms of price too and don't see the need to invest there.\n So near-term pressure for sure, but the fundamentals of the business, I would say, are stronger than ever, and we feel very good about the future. In terms of how long this persists, we said that we expect this to be elevated through the end of the year, at least through Chinese New Year. It's hard to say how long beyond that. This is really a supply and a demand issue. We would expect this to start to normalize, but it's hard to say, hopefully, as we push through next year, but hard to say exactly when that will happen. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Todd, maybe could you speak to new customer acquisition that you're seeing today coming out of this crisis? Maybe if we compared it to customer acquisition or customers that shop Dollar General for the first time coming out of the financial crisis. And with that, if you think about the behavior that you're seeing near term, how would you map out traffic versus basket moving forward, just again, given the current customer behavior that you're seeing today? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I'd tell you what, we are very pleased with what we are seeing with that consumer, especially that new consumer. When you think about -- we launched that retention program back last summer and really pushed the pedal down, if you will, as we move through the back half of last year. And we never took our foot off the accelerator. I'm happy to say that right now, through second quarter, what we're seeing is double our expectation of that retention rate of that newfound consumer. That is higher by a long shot, quite frankly, than what we saw in '08 during the financial crisis.\n So I attribute that quite frankly to the relevancy of this box that we have today. While we made some really nice changes in -- coming out of that '08-'09 time frame, this box now is much more relevant. And I think the important piece is much more relevant across a broad spectrum of the consumer base. And I believe that's why we're keeping that consumer.\n And then when you think about how that mix is looking, as John indicated, we are very, very pleased with our nonconsumable or discretionary side. And that is really enhanced compared to 2008 when you really go back to take a look at it. So not only our consumable business, but our nonconsumable business is doing very, very well.\n And then as I look at how some of the other components are looking, think about units for a moment. On a 2-year stack basis, our units were up 11.5%. That is very, very strong. And that's, again, a real testament to the ability for us to drive that top line with these new consumers, and our existing consumers still see that value, obviously, that she needs.\n So we'll continue to watch that as we go forward. Our goal, as you know, long term, is always to drive that traffic number. And -- but this consumer, especially our core consumer, acts a little different when she has a little extra money. Just as a reminder, when she has extra money in her pocket, we saw it in '08, we see it now, she comes a little less often, spends more once she comes in, and we've seen that on our numbers. As a matter of fact, our 2-year stack traffic number is up about 25%. And again, very, very robust.\n So we believe when things start to normalize and some of this extra money that is in the system through government stimulus may start to wane here, we believe that she'll start coming more often and probably spending a little less, getting back to a normal shopping pattern most likely, Matt. \nMatthew Boss: That's great color. Maybe just as a follow-up, Todd, or maybe even Jeff, I guess by category, where do you see the most low-hanging fruit remaining on the market share front as we think about where you're focusing your initiative efforts coming out of the pandemic from here? \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, Matt. This is Jeff. I'm really proud of the team's ability to really, as you know, they do such a great job of knowing what the customer wants, talking to our customers, but also our category management skills, and our supply chain and our operators give us a lot of flexibility to be able to serve that customer the way she wants to be served. And so very pleased with our DG Fresh rollout and the ability that gives us to continue to broaden that assortment in that very important category for that customer. So very pleased that the gains that we're seeing there.\n Of course, also very pleased that our ability to continue to grow our health and beauty business. And I'm very pleased at the share we've seen there as well. And quite frankly, as you think about it, very pleased overall at our ability to grow share in the quarter. And when you look at it on a 2-year basis as well, very pleased and strong results. So I would say, as we look forward, our goal is always to make this box the most relevant it can be and to serve the customer the way she wants to be served and quite frankly, our teams do that better than anybody. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask on the algorithm into '22. I know it's early and we're not talking guidance. But maybe just some of the puts and takes on the top line, compares will start to ease when you get into next year, but we're also going to be lapping all the stimulus. And then margin picture, some of the pressures could linger into next year. So curious if -- I don't think you'll commit to any algo, but how the puts and takes look in relation to the long-term algo for this business. \nJohn Garratt: Yes, Simeon, I'll start by saying that we feel great about the fundamentals and I've never felt better about the algorithm. I'm not going to obviously give any specific guidance on 2022 as we don't normally at this point. And obviously, things are fluid in terms of the duration and depth of the pandemic and how long these inflationary pressures persist.\n But as we said, we do believe these are transitory. The team is doing a great job to mitigate these and that would provide a tailwind at some point as these -- we believe, as these normalize, as well as we get to more normalized mix levels. Again, that's the other big pressure this year is just lapping unusually high nonconsumable sales and unusually low clearance activity.\n But as you look at the fundamentals, as we've said before, we were at the high end of our 2% to 4% algorithm going into this. We are delighted with what we've seen in terms of the stickiness of the new customers we've brought in, even above expectations, as well as how we've been able to hold on to these larger baskets. And so I think the brand has never been more relevant, and I think this really bodes well going forward on the sales momentum with the initiatives really coming together to help the bottom line and the top line. And again, what we're doing to hang on to these new customers and bigger baskets with this fuller fill-in trip we've been able to provide with the initiatives.\n And in terms of the gross margin, I would say we still see benefit -- growing benefit from our strategic initiatives with more to come and still have all the levers I mentioned at our disposal and see a lot of opportunity there as things normalize.\n So as we push through these, again, what we believe to be transitory pressures, we see ourselves in a position to continue to expand our gross margin. And again, when you tease out the impact of the strategic initiatives to leverage our SG&A at the rates that we have done in the past and then, again, the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. So we feel good all around with the outlook for the business and believe the algorithm is very well intact.\n And when you look at real estate, that's the other piece I would point to that bodes very well for the future in terms of upping the potential units for everybody on our space to 17,000 units. We're seeing unit level economics as good as ever and we continue to innovate with new formats that continues to extend the runway. So feel great about the algorithm. We'll comment on the specifics of 2022 as we go into the next year. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then the follow-up is regarding the second half, the SNAP and child care tax credits, how much, if any, is factored into your second half top line guide? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. What I would say is we've considered all of that. And I would say there's a lot of moving pieces here that seemingly are directionally offsetting. You do have the roll-off of the enhanced unemployment benefits, which is a bit of a headwind, but then you have the child tax credit, which is a bit of a tailwind. And then when you look at SNAP, there's puts and takes there that are directionally offsetting. The 15% benefit expires on October 1. But then with the USDA's action with the Thrifty Food Plan, that puts back some enhanced benefits. And then they did extend the emergency supplemental benefits, which allows waivers -- waivers allows folks to get maximum benefits regardless of income.\n So as you look at all the pieces, it's hard to say exactly what the net impact would be, but right now, it looks directionally offsetting, and that's contemplated in the guidance. And we feel very good about the guidance based on what we know now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I just -- to the guidance and the implied second half. So you obviously raised your top line guidance for the full year, but not obviously raised in the second half. But when we look at the guidance for the EBIT margin implied guide for the second half, that's come down despite the higher sales. So I realize you did call out 1 or 2 things, but I still can't get it to quite account for the change in what the implied EBIT margin guidance is for the second half. So maybe a little more color there. And then I had another big picture question. \nJohn Garratt: Sure. Okay. No, good question, Karen. I'll start by saying we feel good about the updated guidance based on the strong first half results. And as you mentioned, we did raise our sales outlook. We raised the floor on EPS, held the ceiling on the EPS guidance. But I think when you look at the 2-year lap, it's important to look at what this implies in terms of a 2-year CAGR, and that's a CAGR of 20% to 24%. So we feel great about that outsized performance relative to the algorithm.\n What I would tell you is we have seen, as we mentioned, seen increased pressure from freight. And so that is the limiting factor here in terms of the ability to take that up. We did -- as others saw, we did see heightened pressures around transportation to a lesser extent. We mentioned with our LIFO provision, we did see higher costs in terms of product costs, and that's largely a function of some transportation costs being passed through. So really, that's the driver of that.\n But again, I would tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, never been better. And we're going to wait and see how things play out. But that's really the pressures as we look at the back half of the year. And again, we believe them to be transitory in nature and very pleased with the performance based on the -- that the guidance would indicate in terms of being a step change to the top line and the bottom line over the normal algorithm. \nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess there's kind of this view that in general, that the lower-end consumer will really struggle next year as all these benefits lap. And I think there's some perspective that, that will negatively impact you disproportionately. I'm not sure I agree with that. But how do you think about the puts and takes to DG, if that is true in general in terms of your core customer feeling much more challenged? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Karen, this is Todd. I'll take that one. And I would tell you, we feel very good about this core customer. And also remember, the customer that we've retained during this pandemic and continue to retain, we feel very good about keeping her well engaged into next year as well. You couple that with all the initiatives that we have in front of us, both in play and as you heard from Jeff, some newer ones like health care that will, in fact, start to play out as we go into next year, but even longer term than that.\n But when you start to think about who we are, right, and who we serve, we're an all-weather brand and always have been. And it's even more pronounced now, I believe, than every before, right? So when times are good, we do pretty well. And when times aren't so good, that consumer needs us more. And now we've got that new trading customer that we've gotten, that seemingly will have a little bit more money even when times turn a little negative for our core customers.\n So once again, we feel good about it. We're not prepared to give guidance yet for '22. But we here always control what we can control. And we feel good about that algorithm over time growing the comps at 2% to 4% over the long term. And that is still our vision, and we work toward that each and every day. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Todd, do you feel like you've worked off some of the excess that a lot of the consumable retailers experienced during the heart of the pandemic? And another way to look at it is your guidance for the back half of the year implies 2-year compound annual sales growth rate of 9% to 10%, which is largely consistent with what you were doing in 2019 prior to the pandemic.\n So as other consumable retailers are experiencing a drag from a further return to normalcy and less new occasions at home, perhaps you'll face less of a drag because your workers have been working at a work site the whole time. You've got new customers, and you've got your initiatives such that you've entered into a sustainable sales rhythm from here? \nTodd Vasos: Well, we look at all that, as you say, Michael, and I would tell you, that we do feel good about where this consumer is and how she lines up, if you will, based on what is ahead of her. But again, that whole notion that we control -- what we can control is really what we're squarely focused on.\n But yes, I would tell you, the implied number that you're talking about is that in that 4% to 5% type of a comp rate, whether we hit that or not, that's still well on top of our algorithm, if you will. So we feel good about it. I don't want to get ahead of our skis and say that it will be even better. But I would tell you, with the initiatives that we have and the retention rates we're seeing from that new consumer, that's what gives us the confidence to raise that sales guidance in the back half of this year and will propel us into '22. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is on the gross margin. The 87 basis point increase over 2019, is it fair for us to assume half of that was due to your initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI, and the other half is from still a favorable environment where promotions have not returned to the level of 2019? And can you quantify this for simplicity's sake, John, how much gross margin pressure you are expecting because of these elevated freight costs? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. In terms of -- when you strip out the noise of the freight costs, it is the same fundamental drivers, and we continue to see huge benefits from initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI. And again, we've been talking for several quarters around as we kept calling out the 3 biggest drivers, it was lower product costs associated with DG Fresh. It was lower markdowns and favorable mix, and a big driver of that was NCI. So we're continuing to see those benefits. They're continuing to grow. I don't want to give a specific number on that, but I would say, that continues to be the biggest drivers of -- when you strip out the noise of what's been the biggest levers to improve our gross margin.\n So that's not changed. What has changed is, one, the much more difficult lap of NCI from -- of the 40% nonconsumable growth we lapped in this quarter and then the heightened pressures associated with freight and, to a lesser extent, product costs. So the fundamentals are unchanged. That's really the drivers.\n We didn't give a specific number on freight, but what I would tell you is, as we listed out the headwinds, that was the #1 headwind that we called out. And then we did say, as we look in the back half of the year, that's similar to Q2, we expect that to be a -- although we think it's transitory over the longer term, that continues to be a growing headwind for us versus what we previously thought. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Todd, I got two, but I want to start with -- you guys have always said the biggest share donor to you are the drug stores. So I'm curious about your thoughts on health care. And then in particular, when you think about services, product, maybe is there an opportunity to partner with independent pharmacists in a way? How do you think about the sources and magnitude of that opportunity? Does that rise to a NCI type of opportunity do you think in magnitude? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, John, that's a great question, and thanks for asking it because we're pretty excited about what this health care initiative could hold. But I want to caution everybody, this will be a journey over many years, right? But what we're going to be squarely focused on here is exactly what you talked about, those services that rural America today especially doesn't have access to. We talk a lot about grocery deserts or food deserts. There's as equal health care deserts out there across the U.S., and we're in all of these communities.\n And then when you step back from that, with my background in health, we really know that there's an opportunity for these services. So whether it be eye care as an example, whether it be telemedicine, whether it be prescription delivery, not -- by the way, not pharmacies in our stores, but build to order and maybe pick up inside of our store, those type of things, mail order.\n And so could we benefit with a partnership? Possibly. We're going to be fishing all that out over the next many quarters. But could it be bigger than NCI? I think this could easily eclipse NCI. I don't want to get in front of our skis, but it could be a really big deal not only for our top line and bottom line at Dollar General, but even more so making that box even more relevant to those consumers in rural America that have to drive now 30, 40 minutes for an eye exam as an example, or even to see a doctor.\n So we believe that there's some real opportunity here. You can probably tell in my voice, I'm pretty excited about it, but the journey is just beginning. \nJohn Heinbockel: And maybe just as a follow-up to that, right? When you think about doing the store-within-a-store right in the DG Markets. And I know I ask this all the time, but the box is getting bigger. Does the small version of DG Market eventually come on the radar screen again as another format, where you'd rather use the 8,500 to accomplish that? \nTodd Vasos: No, John, we've got a smaller version of the DG Market already. As a matter of fact, we continue to grow that. And that -- the genesis of that was the Walmart Express stores that we bought back a few years ago. And we've cultivated those 44 stores we bought and have grown that format as well. We don't talk about it a lot, because we believe that over time, it could be a big piece, though, of our rural strategy, especially you just mentioned in that combo piece.\n Because if -- we already have stores in -- within 75% of our stores within 5-mile radius of the overall population. And if we could give her even more options, including health care, including pOpshelf inside of a smaller box, I believe it could be really powerful. And I know Jeff believes that as well, and we'll be working toward that over the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Just in terms of freight, just to be clear, how much of that is domestic versus ocean freight? And how much are you passing along or not passing along in the current environment? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you that the majority of the headwind is coming from the import side of that equation. We have seen some tightness in the domestic market, but pretty manageable overall there. It really is the import side that we feel is the headwind here.\n And then as far as passing along, what we do here at Dollar General, probably better than most is negotiate with our vendors, with our size and scale. We've been doing that for many years. It's second nature to us, if you will. But I would tell you that we've been able to offset some of these inflationary pressures that you've seen out there. But yet, we have taken price in some instances. But what I'm happy to say is that our price positioning is as good as it's ever been.\n As you may remember over the last few quarters, I've been very bullish on our positioning and it's just as good as ever. So I would tell you, we've been very thoughtful on passing along price, because we know that our core consumer can ill afford very many price increases. But we have the ability with just 10,000 to 12,000 SKUs to also pick and choose the SKUs that we offer our consumer. And if we have some price increases that we don't believe we should pass on to her, we'll drop the SKU and move on to something else that, in fact, she'll need also. And we've done that a lot in the last quarter to 2 quarters. \nKelly Bania: Great. That's very helpful. And just also wanted to follow up on a comment you made. You talked about some of the puts and takes in terms of the macro in the back half, including the end of the extended unemployment benefits. I was just curious what you are seeing in some of those states, both from impact on the top line when those states ended the benefits and also just in the wage and employee environment. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. What we have seen is when you look at the employee environment, I'll start with that. What we initially saw as those states rolled off the enhanced unemployment benefits. What we did see was an initial nice pickup in applicant flow and staffing. The good news now is we're seeing that across the system. And so it's hard to discern that impact now because everything is up. And so that's been helpful.\n We did see a little bit, not a huge impact, but we did see a little bit of a negative impact in states when the enhanced unemployment benefits rolled off. But then as I mentioned, then you have the benefit of the child tax credit. And that's why we said as we look at all the puts and takes, the way we see it now, we think it's directionally offsetting. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just had two things to ask on. One was just a little bit surprised on some of the discretionary headwind, given the strength that we've seen from some other retailers in that area. So I was just hoping you could help explain a little bit more why that would be a headwind? And then what's the timing for that to kind of roll off? And then the follow-up was on traffic. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you, Michael, I think the discretionary headwind that we talk about really stems from the robust number we had last year. Last year, other retailers were either shut down still, limited hours, one-way aisles. I think you remember all of that. We were pretty much in full swing last year, helping out all the communities that we serve. So it was really on a 2-year stack basis, we couldn't be more happier or proud of our discretionary business. As a matter of fact, feel very robust about it going into the back half of the year and in years to come because of our NCI initiatives, because of our pOpshelf initiatives and many other things that we're working on.\n So yes, I wouldn't characterize it any other way other than on a year-over-year basis is really the headwind. I would tell you that starts to subside as we move into '22, right? And so watch out for that as we move into '22. But right now, we feel good about where we are on a discretionary platform basis. \nMichael Montani: Okay. Great. And then just wanted to clarify on the 2-year traffic stack for 2Q and 1Q. Was 2Q a high single-digit decline on traffic, if you do a 2-year stack? Just trying to see how that's been trending. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you, we really haven't said what those numbers were, but as I mentioned earlier, we just have to remember, on the traffic side, you've got 2 things that are in play here. Number one, you still have a consumer that is contracting her shopping patterns due to COVID, right? You still have some of that dynamic going on, not as much as we saw last year, obviously, and we're starting to see those traffic numbers come back, and I'll explain that in a second.\n What we're starting to see now is as stimulus starts to wane, COVID in many states starting to wane, I know it's flaring in certain states and a little less than others. The consumer is getting out more, and we're seeing our traffic numbers start to rebound. And what normally happens with our core consumer as that dynamic takes place, especially around her income levels, what we'll start to see is smaller basket sizes and more traffic. And that's exactly what we're starting to see occur over the last couple of months, and we anticipate that to continue as we move through the back half of the year. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. \nTodd Vasos: Well, thank you very much for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I want to start by saying how proud I am of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, resulting in another great quarter.\n As you heard today, we have a number of exciting initiatives in place, and we believe we are well positioned to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time, while providing a strong employee proposition. So overall, I'm proud of the year-to-date results, feel very good about the underlying business and very optimistic about the future.\n Thank you for listening. And I hope you have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results and continue to be grateful to our associates for their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. Despite what remains a challenging operating environment, including additional uncertainties brought on by the Delta variant and pressures on the global supply chain, our teams continue to successfully adapt and deliver for our customers. Because of their efforts, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in customer traffic as compared to Q1 and once again, increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and believe we are well positioned to navigate the current inflationary environment and global supply chain challenges. As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers is our primary focus, while meeting the needs of the communities we serve. And with more than 17,500 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience.\n To that end, we recently hired our first Chief Medical Officer. Going forward, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to affordable health care products and services, particularly in rural America. Overall, we remain focused on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\n Turning now to our second quarter performance. As we continue to lap difficult quarterly sales comparisons from the prior year, net sales decreased 0.4% to $8.7 billion, followed by a 24.4% increase in Q2 of 2020. Comp sales declined 4.7% compared to the prior year period, which translates into a robust 14.1% increase on a 2-year stack basis. Our Q2 sales results include a year-over-year decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by the growth in average basket size. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest in May, with July being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to report that Q3 is off to a great start.\n Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the retention rates of new customers acquired in 2020, underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition. We believe we will ultimately exit the pandemic with a larger, broader and more engaged customer base than when we entered it, resulting in an even stronger foundation from which to grow. Overall, our second quarter results reflect strong execution across many fronts as we continue to strengthen our position while further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock significant growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying strength of the business, and we're confident we are pursuing the right strategies to enable balanced and sustainable growth by creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Yes. Rupesh, we are happy with the way Q3 started out. Back-to-school is doing very well for us. We got all of our products that we anticipated getting from overseas as well as domestically. And the consumer has a little extra money in their pocket. So as evidenced by our guidance in the back half, we feel pretty good about our sales line as we go forward. Yes, Matt, that's a great question. And I'd tell you what, we are very pleased with what we are seeing with that consumer, especially that new consumer. When you think about -- we launched that retention program back last summer and really pushed the pedal down, if you will, as we move through the back half of last year. And we never took our foot off the accelerator. I'm happy to say that right now, through second quarter, what we're seeing is double our expectation of that retention rate of that newfound consumer. That is higher by a long shot, quite frankly, than what we saw in '08 during the financial crisis.\n So I attribute that quite frankly to the relevancy of this box that we have today. While we made some really nice changes in -- coming out of that '08-'09 time frame, this box now is much more relevant. And I think the important piece is much more relevant across a broad spectrum of the consumer base. And I believe that's why we're keeping that consumer.\n And then when you think about how that mix is looking, as John indicated, we are very, very pleased with our nonconsumable or discretionary side. And that is really enhanced compared to 2008 when you really go back to take a look at it. So not only our consumable business, but our nonconsumable business is doing very, very well.\n And then as I look at how some of the other components are looking, think about units for a moment. On a 2-year stack basis, our units were up 11.5%. That is very, very strong. And that's, again, a real testament to the ability for us to drive that top line with these new consumers, and our existing consumers still see that value, obviously, that she needs.\n So we'll continue to watch that as we go forward. Our goal, as you know, long term, is always to drive that traffic number. And -- but this consumer, especially our core consumer, acts a little different when she has a little extra money. Just as a reminder, when she has extra money in her pocket, we saw it in '08, we see it now, she comes a little less often, spends more once she comes in, and we've seen that on our numbers. As a matter of fact, our 2-year stack traffic number is up about 25%. And again, very, very robust.\n So we believe when things start to normalize and some of this extra money that is in the system through government stimulus may start to wane here, we believe that she'll start coming more often and probably spending a little less, getting back to a normal shopping pattern most likely, Matt. Yes. Karen, this is Todd. I'll take that one. And I would tell you, we feel very good about this core customer. And also remember, the customer that we've retained during this pandemic and continue to retain, we feel very good about keeping her well engaged into next year as well. You couple that with all the initiatives that we have in front of us, both in play and as you heard from Jeff, some newer ones like health care that will, in fact, start to play out as we go into next year, but even longer term than that.\n But when you start to think about who we are, right, and who we serve, we're an all-weather brand and always have been. And it's even more pronounced now, I believe, than every before, right? So when times are good, we do pretty well. And when times aren't so good, that consumer needs us more. And now we've got that new trading customer that we've gotten, that seemingly will have a little bit more money even when times turn a little negative for our core customers.\n So once again, we feel good about it. We're not prepared to give guidance yet for '22. But we here always control what we can control. And we feel good about that algorithm over time growing the comps at 2% to 4% over the long term. And that is still our vision, and we work toward that each and every day. Well, we look at all that, as you say, Michael, and I would tell you, that we do feel good about where this consumer is and how she lines up, if you will, based on what is ahead of her. But again, that whole notion that we control -- what we can control is really what we're squarely focused on.\n But yes, I would tell you, the implied number that you're talking about is that in that 4% to 5% type of a comp rate, whether we hit that or not, that's still well on top of our algorithm, if you will. So we feel good about it. I don't want to get ahead of our skis and say that it will be even better. But I would tell you, with the initiatives that we have and the retention rates we're seeing from that new consumer, that's what gives us the confidence to raise that sales guidance in the back half of this year and will propel us into '22. Yes, John, that's a great question, and thanks for asking it because we're pretty excited about what this health care initiative could hold. But I want to caution everybody, this will be a journey over many years, right? But what we're going to be squarely focused on here is exactly what you talked about, those services that rural America today especially doesn't have access to. We talk a lot about grocery deserts or food deserts. There's as equal health care deserts out there across the U.S., and we're in all of these communities.\n And then when you step back from that, with my background in health, we really know that there's an opportunity for these services. So whether it be eye care as an example, whether it be telemedicine, whether it be prescription delivery, not -- by the way, not pharmacies in our stores, but build to order and maybe pick up inside of our store, those type of things, mail order.\n And so could we benefit with a partnership? Possibly. We're going to be fishing all that out over the next many quarters. But could it be bigger than NCI? I think this could easily eclipse NCI. I don't want to get in front of our skis, but it could be a really big deal not only for our top line and bottom line at Dollar General, but even more so making that box even more relevant to those consumers in rural America that have to drive now 30, 40 minutes for an eye exam as an example, or even to see a doctor.\n So we believe that there's some real opportunity here. You can probably tell in my voice, I'm pretty excited about it, but the journey is just beginning. No, John, we've got a smaller version of the DG Market already. As a matter of fact, we continue to grow that. And that -- the genesis of that was the Walmart Express stores that we bought back a few years ago. And we've cultivated those 44 stores we bought and have grown that format as well. We don't talk about it a lot, because we believe that over time, it could be a big piece, though, of our rural strategy, especially you just mentioned in that combo piece.\n Because if -- we already have stores in -- within 75% of our stores within 5-mile radius of the overall population. And if we could give her even more options, including health care, including pOpshelf inside of a smaller box, I believe it could be really powerful. And I know Jeff believes that as well, and we'll be working toward that over the next few years. Yes. I would tell you that the majority of the headwind is coming from the import side of that equation. We have seen some tightness in the domestic market, but pretty manageable overall there. It really is the import side that we feel is the headwind here.\n And then as far as passing along, what we do here at Dollar General, probably better than most is negotiate with our vendors, with our size and scale. We've been doing that for many years. It's second nature to us, if you will. But I would tell you that we've been able to offset some of these inflationary pressures that you've seen out there. But yet, we have taken price in some instances. But what I'm happy to say is that our price positioning is as good as it's ever been.\n As you may remember over the last few quarters, I've been very bullish on our positioning and it's just as good as ever. So I would tell you, we've been very thoughtful on passing along price, because we know that our core consumer can ill afford very many price increases. But we have the ability with just 10,000 to 12,000 SKUs to also pick and choose the SKUs that we offer our consumer. And if we have some price increases that we don't believe we should pass on to her, we'll drop the SKU and move on to something else that, in fact, she'll need also. And we've done that a lot in the last quarter to 2 quarters. Yes. I would tell you, Michael, I think the discretionary headwind that we talk about really stems from the robust number we had last year. Last year, other retailers were either shut down still, limited hours, one-way aisles. I think you remember all of that. We were pretty much in full swing last year, helping out all the communities that we serve. So it was really on a 2-year stack basis, we couldn't be more happier or proud of our discretionary business. As a matter of fact, feel very robust about it going into the back half of the year and in years to come because of our NCI initiatives, because of our pOpshelf initiatives and many other things that we're working on.\n So yes, I wouldn't characterize it any other way other than on a year-over-year basis is really the headwind. I would tell you that starts to subside as we move into '22, right? And so watch out for that as we move into '22. But right now, we feel good about where we are on a discretionary platform basis. Yes. I would tell you, we really haven't said what those numbers were, but as I mentioned earlier, we just have to remember, on the traffic side, you've got 2 things that are in play here. Number one, you still have a consumer that is contracting her shopping patterns due to COVID, right? You still have some of that dynamic going on, not as much as we saw last year, obviously, and we're starting to see those traffic numbers come back, and I'll explain that in a second.\n What we're starting to see now is as stimulus starts to wane, COVID in many states starting to wane, I know it's flaring in certain states and a little less than others. The consumer is getting out more, and we're seeing our traffic numbers start to rebound. And what normally happens with our core consumer as that dynamic takes place, especially around her income levels, what we'll start to see is smaller basket sizes and more traffic. And that's exactly what we're starting to see occur over the last couple of months, and we anticipate that to continue as we move through the back half of the year. Well, thank you very much for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I want to start by saying how proud I am of this team, which continues to execute at a high level, resulting in another great quarter.\n As you heard today, we have a number of exciting initiatives in place, and we believe we are well positioned to grow same-store sales, new stores, operating profit margins and market share over time, while providing a strong employee proposition. So overall, I'm proud of the year-to-date results, feel very good about the underlying business and very optimistic about the future.\n Thank you for listening. And I hope you have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, gross profit in Q2 2020 was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 41% in our combined nonconsumables categories. For Q2 2021, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, a decrease of 80 basis points, but an increase of 87 basis points compared to Q2 2019. The decrease compared to Q2 2020 was primarily attributable to: increased transportation costs, a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable categories and an increase in inventory damages. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction shrink as a percentage of sales.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.8%, an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor and store occupancy costs.\n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the second quarter decreased 18.5% to $849.6 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.8%, a decrease of 219 basis points. And while the unusual and difficult prior year comparison created pressure on our operating margin rate, we're very pleased with the improvement in our profitability on a 2-year basis. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% and compares to 21.5% in the second quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the second quarter decreased 13.8% to $2.69, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% or 24.3% compared to Q2 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 20% overall and 13.7% on a per store basis as we continue to cycle unusually low levels of inventory in Q2 2020, which were driven by extremely strong sales volumes in that quarter.\n Similar to Q1, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories in anticipation of longer lead times. As a result, we were pleased with our strong inventory position for the back-to-school shopping season, and our teams continue to work closely with suppliers to ensure delivery of seasonal and other goods in the remaining back half of the year.\n Year-to-date through Q2, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.3 billion. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $518 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $98 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $979 million.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of about 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021, we continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economic recovery, global supply chain, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, including additional pressure throughout the supply chain and cost inflation, we are updating our full year sales and EPS guidance, which reflects our strong first half performance.\n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales growth of 0.5 point to 1.5 points; a same-store sales decline of 3.5% to 2.5%, which reflects growth of approximately 13% to 14% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.60 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 20% to 24% or approximately 19% to 23% compared to 2019 adjusted EPS over a 2-year period. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Our expectations for real estate projects remain unchanged from what we stated in our earnings release on May 27, 2021.\n With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $2.2 billion. Finally, we are increasing our expectations for capital spending in 2021 to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion to reflect higher equipment costs for store projects and the pull forward of select supply chain investments.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of sales, we remain cautious in our 2021 outlook, given the current continued uncertainties arising from COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the expected end of additional federal unemployment benefits.\n Turning to gross margin, please keep in mind we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance from the prior year, where we benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates. Much like our Q2 results, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the second half due to a less favorable sales mix compared to prior year, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020 and higher LIFO provisions as a result of cost of goods increases.\n We also anticipate higher supply chain costs in the second half compared to our previous expectations. Like other retailers, our business is seeing the effects of higher cost due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third-party carriers. However, despite these challenges, our team was able to meet strong customer demand during the quarter, and we're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures.\n Finally, please keep in mind that the third quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following an improvement of 178 basis points in Q3 2020. With regards to SG&A, we now expect about $70 million to $80 million in incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. This amount includes $40 million in incremental investments made during the first half of the year. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n In closing, we are proud of our second quarter results, which are a testament to the performance and strong execution by the entire team. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Yes. So in terms of gross margin, and I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the performance, up 62 basis points year-to-date. While down 80 basis points in Q2, were up 87 basis points over Q2 2019 as we continue to see initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI and others really contributing. But like with our Q2 results, we do expect some continued pressure on gross margin in the second half due primarily to inflation, which we believe to be transitory, but related to higher transportation costs, higher than previously expected. Of course, we're seeing elevated demand with the great sales, and that's resulting in some transportation and supply capacity challenges with our third-party carriers.\n And then on top of that, we did mention a higher LIFO provision as a result of product cost increases. Some others have seen similar inflation and pass some of that along. And then, of course, we have a very challenging lap as we talked about with the year-over-year mix. In Q2, we lapped 40% nonconsumable sales. And so while nonconsumable business is still doing fabulously, it's a very difficult lap in the back half. And certainly, you have a very favorable last year mix profile with that mix. And then you also had unusually low clearance activity associated with nonconsumables on that high sell-through.\n So while we expect to continue to do well, it provides a challenging lap. So a difficult lap near-term inflationary pressures, which, again, we believe to be transitory. But as you look ahead, we believe still, that with the growing benefit from initiatives, with all the levers at our disposal between private brands, foreign sourcing, shrink, supply chain efficiencies as we get through the near-term pressures and of course, category management and of course, our scale, we believe we're in a great position to continue to expand margins over the long term and believe we're in a great spot right now in terms of price too and don't see the need to invest there.\n So near-term pressure for sure, but the fundamentals of the business, I would say, are stronger than ever, and we feel very good about the future. In terms of how long this persists, we said that we expect this to be elevated through the end of the year, at least through Chinese New Year. It's hard to say how long beyond that. This is really a supply and a demand issue. We would expect this to start to normalize, but it's hard to say, hopefully, as we push through next year, but hard to say exactly when that will happen. Yes, Simeon, I'll start by saying that we feel great about the fundamentals and I've never felt better about the algorithm. I'm not going to obviously give any specific guidance on 2022 as we don't normally at this point. And obviously, things are fluid in terms of the duration and depth of the pandemic and how long these inflationary pressures persist.\n But as we said, we do believe these are transitory. The team is doing a great job to mitigate these and that would provide a tailwind at some point as these -- we believe, as these normalize, as well as we get to more normalized mix levels. Again, that's the other big pressure this year is just lapping unusually high nonconsumable sales and unusually low clearance activity.\n But as you look at the fundamentals, as we've said before, we were at the high end of our 2% to 4% algorithm going into this. We are delighted with what we've seen in terms of the stickiness of the new customers we've brought in, even above expectations, as well as how we've been able to hold on to these larger baskets. And so I think the brand has never been more relevant, and I think this really bodes well going forward on the sales momentum with the initiatives really coming together to help the bottom line and the top line. And again, what we're doing to hang on to these new customers and bigger baskets with this fuller fill-in trip we've been able to provide with the initiatives.\n And in terms of the gross margin, I would say we still see benefit -- growing benefit from our strategic initiatives with more to come and still have all the levers I mentioned at our disposal and see a lot of opportunity there as things normalize.\n So as we push through these, again, what we believe to be transitory pressures, we see ourselves in a position to continue to expand our gross margin. And again, when you tease out the impact of the strategic initiatives to leverage our SG&A at the rates that we have done in the past and then, again, the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. So we feel good all around with the outlook for the business and believe the algorithm is very well intact.\n And when you look at real estate, that's the other piece I would point to that bodes very well for the future in terms of upping the potential units for everybody on our space to 17,000 units. We're seeing unit level economics as good as ever and we continue to innovate with new formats that continues to extend the runway. So feel great about the algorithm. We'll comment on the specifics of 2022 as we go into the next year. Yes. What I would say is we've considered all of that. And I would say there's a lot of moving pieces here that seemingly are directionally offsetting. You do have the roll-off of the enhanced unemployment benefits, which is a bit of a headwind, but then you have the child tax credit, which is a bit of a tailwind. And then when you look at SNAP, there's puts and takes there that are directionally offsetting. The 15% benefit expires on October 1. But then with the USDA's action with the Thrifty Food Plan, that puts back some enhanced benefits. And then they did extend the emergency supplemental benefits, which allows waivers -- waivers allows folks to get maximum benefits regardless of income.\n So as you look at all the pieces, it's hard to say exactly what the net impact would be, but right now, it looks directionally offsetting, and that's contemplated in the guidance. And we feel very good about the guidance based on what we know now. Sure. Okay. No, good question, Karen. I'll start by saying we feel good about the updated guidance based on the strong first half results. And as you mentioned, we did raise our sales outlook. We raised the floor on EPS, held the ceiling on the EPS guidance. But I think when you look at the 2-year lap, it's important to look at what this implies in terms of a 2-year CAGR, and that's a CAGR of 20% to 24%. So we feel great about that outsized performance relative to the algorithm.\n What I would tell you is we have seen, as we mentioned, seen increased pressure from freight. And so that is the limiting factor here in terms of the ability to take that up. We did -- as others saw, we did see heightened pressures around transportation to a lesser extent. We mentioned with our LIFO provision, we did see higher costs in terms of product costs, and that's largely a function of some transportation costs being passed through. So really, that's the driver of that.\n But again, I would tell you, we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, never been better. And we're going to wait and see how things play out. But that's really the pressures as we look at the back half of the year. And again, we believe them to be transitory in nature and very pleased with the performance based on the -- that the guidance would indicate in terms of being a step change to the top line and the bottom line over the normal algorithm. Yes. In terms of -- when you strip out the noise of the freight costs, it is the same fundamental drivers, and we continue to see huge benefits from initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI. And again, we've been talking for several quarters around as we kept calling out the 3 biggest drivers, it was lower product costs associated with DG Fresh. It was lower markdowns and favorable mix, and a big driver of that was NCI. So we're continuing to see those benefits. They're continuing to grow. I don't want to give a specific number on that, but I would say, that continues to be the biggest drivers of -- when you strip out the noise of what's been the biggest levers to improve our gross margin.\n So that's not changed. What has changed is, one, the much more difficult lap of NCI from -- of the 40% nonconsumable growth we lapped in this quarter and then the heightened pressures associated with freight and, to a lesser extent, product costs. So the fundamentals are unchanged. That's really the drivers.\n We didn't give a specific number on freight, but what I would tell you is, as we listed out the headwinds, that was the #1 headwind that we called out. And then we did say, as we look in the back half of the year, that's similar to Q2, we expect that to be a -- although we think it's transitory over the longer term, that continues to be a growing headwind for us versus what we previously thought. Yes. What we have seen is when you look at the employee environment, I'll start with that. What we initially saw as those states rolled off the enhanced unemployment benefits. What we did see was an initial nice pickup in applicant flow and staffing. The good news now is we're seeing that across the system. And so it's hard to discern that impact now because everything is up. And so that's been helpful.\n We did see a little bit, not a huge impact, but we did see a little bit of a negative impact in states when the enhanced unemployment benefits rolled off. But then as I mentioned, then you have the benefit of the child tax credit. And that's why we said as we look at all the puts and takes, the way we see it now, we think it's directionally offsetting."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team continues to drive strong execution against a robust portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of our more recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative or NCI. The NCI offering was available in more than 8,800 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. In fact, this performance is contributing to an incremental 1% to 2.5% total comp sales increase in NCI stores and a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Overall, we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, with the goal of completing the rollout of NCI across nearly the entire chain by year-end 2022.\n Moving to our newer store concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 8 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 16, including 4 conversions of a traditional Dollar General store into our pOpshelf concept. And while still early, we remain extremely pleased with our results, which continue to exceed our expectations for both sales and gross margin.\n We also recently opened our first 2 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger Dollar General market stores, and we're encouraged by the initial results, including positive reaction from customers. For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts as we continue to lay the foundation for future growth. Overall, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. I'm very pleased to report that during the quarter, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and are now delivering to more than 17,500 stores from 12 facilities. This important milestone is a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication of the team, and I want to thank them for their incredible execution over the past 2.5 years. Notably, the rollout was completed about 6 months ahead of our initial rollout schedule.\n As a reminder, the primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher inventory markups, and we expect additional benefits going forward as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of additional products, including both national and private brands. For example, we recently introduced about 25 new and exclusive items under the Armour brand as we continue to optimize our assortment while further differentiating our product offering from others. And while produce was not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh provides a potential path to accelerating our produce offering in up to 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.\n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the first half, we added more than 34,000 cooler doors across our store base and remain on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin-enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 772 real estate projects, including 270 new stores, 477 remodels and 25 relocations. For the full year, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,500 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 2,000 stores by year-end.\n As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing our larger 8,500 square foot format as our base prototype for nearly all new stores going forward. We're especially pleased with the sales productivity of this larger format as average sales per square foot continue to trend well above an average traditional store. In total, we expect to have nearly 2,000 stores in this format by the end of the year as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app, which continues to grow in popularity. In fact, we ended Q2 with nearly 4 million monthly active users on the app, a 28% increase over prior year.\n Importantly, as we continue to drive higher levels of digital engagement, our DG Media Network, which we launched in 2018, has become an increasingly more relevant platform for connecting our brand partners with our customers. Of note, during the first half, the number of campaigns on our platform increased 65% compared to the prior year period, and we are very excited about the growth potential of this business as we look to further enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset.\n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of optimizing our rolltainers and case pack sizes, resulting in the more efficient stocking of our stores.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in approximately 4,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates and higher overall satisfaction scores in stores that include this offering. Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we remain focused on introducing self-checkout into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail.\n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve. As evidence, we recently launched a national hiring event with the goal of hiring up to an additional 50,000 employees by Labor Day, and I am pleased to note that we are on track to meet our goal.\n We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. And because over 75% of our store associates at or above the lead sales associate position were internally placed, employees who joined Dollar General know they have an opportunity to grow their career with us.\n We also continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as pOpshelf. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by a robust internal promotion pipeline and staffing above traditional levels. We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month, resulting in a rich and virtual development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This is one of my favorite events every year, and I was once again inspired by the incredible talent and dedication of our people.\n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance as we continue to advance our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Overall, we are very pleased with our position as we head into the back half of the year, and I'm excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our more than 159,000 employees across the company for their unwavering commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thank you, Matt. This is Jeff. I'm really proud of the team's ability to really, as you know, they do such a great job of knowing what the customer wants, talking to our customers, but also our category management skills, and our supply chain and our operators give us a lot of flexibility to be able to serve that customer the way she wants to be served. And so very pleased with our DG Fresh rollout and the ability that gives us to continue to broaden that assortment in that very important category for that customer. So very pleased that the gains that we're seeing there.\n Of course, also very pleased that our ability to continue to grow our health and beauty business. And I'm very pleased at the share we've seen there as well. And quite frankly, as you think about it, very pleased overall at our ability to grow share in the quarter. And when you look at it on a 2-year basis as well, very pleased and strong results. So I would say, as we look forward, our goal is always to make this box the most relevant it can be and to serve the customer the way she wants to be served and quite frankly, our teams do that better than anybody."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, May 27, 2021. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\n I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, please begin. \nDonny Lau: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2021, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to supporting our customers, communities and each other. As a testament to their efforts, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance across the business, which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\n The quarter was highlighted by net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories, a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, we are increasing our sales and diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2021 to reflect our strong first quarter performance. John will provide additional details on our outlook during his remarks.\n As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers continue to be a top priority while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve. And we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. \n Overall, we are executing well against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\n Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter. As we lapped our most difficult quarterly comp sales comparison of the year, net sales decreased 0.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by a comp sales decline of 4.6%. Notably, comp sales on a 2-year stack basis increased a robust 17.1%, which compares to the 15.9% 2-year stack we delivered last quarter. \n Our first quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by growth in average basket size. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they continue to spend more with us compared to last year.\n From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales increased 5.7% in February despite a headwind from inclement weather across the country. For the month of March, which represents our most difficult monthly sales comparison of the year, comp sales declined 11.2%. Importantly, beginning in mid-March and in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw a meaningful acceleration in sales relative to the first 2 weeks of the month, especially in our nonconsumable categories. Comp sales declined 4.3% in April. And while year-over-year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to March, they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap.\n Overall, each of our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter. Of note, comp sales growth of 11.3% in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8% on a comparable 2-year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories, enhanced by the benefit from stimulus. Once again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.\n Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. In addition, we recently published our third annual Serving Others report, which provides context related to our ongoing ESG efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead.\n Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and believe we are well positioned to continue advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock even more growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying business, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which we believe was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant benefit to sales, particularly in our nonconsumables categories from the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8% in the first quarter. As Todd noted, this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to: higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs, which were primarily driven by higher rates.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%, an increase of 152 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales, the most significant of which were store occupancy costs, disaster expenses related to Winter Storm Uri, retail labor and depreciation and amortization.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $908.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.8%, an increase of 56 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% and compares to 22.2% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter increased 10.2% to $2.82, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38% over a 2-year period.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 24.2% overall and a 17.6% increase on a per store basis as we cycled a 5.5% decline in inventory on a per store basis, driven by extremely strong sales volumes in Q1 2020.\n In anticipation of a more challenging supply environment, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business. And while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory.\n The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $703 million, a decrease of 60% but which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a 2-year period. This decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of inventory as a result of improving inventory positions, including the pull forward of certain inventory purchases I mentioned earlier.\n Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $278 million and included: our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; distribution and transportation projects; and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1 billion and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $100 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.7 billion.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our full year guidance for sales and EPS due to our strong Q1 outperformance, which we believe was aided by the latest round of stimulus.\n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales in the range of a 1% decline to an increase of 1%; a same-store sales decline of 5% to 3% but which reflects growth of approximately 11% to 13% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.50 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of approximately 20% to 24% or in the range of approximately 19% to 23% compared to the 2019 adjusted diluted EPS over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%.\n With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.2 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $1.8 billion. \n Finally, our 2021 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q4 2020 earnings release on March 18, 2021.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. First, there could be additional headwinds and tailwinds this year, the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business of which are currently unclear, including but not limited to the potential impacts from legislation and regulatory agency actions. Given the unusual situation, I will now elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in May.\n From the end of Q1 through May 23, comp sales declined by approximately 7% as we continue to cycle extremely difficult prior year comparisons. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of May in 2020 was 21.5%. And while we are nonetheless encouraged with our sales trends, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued uncertainty that still exists, the unique comparisons against last year and the anticipation of fading tailwinds from the most recent round of government stimulus. That said, as you think about the comp sales cadence of 2021, we continue to expect our performance to be better in the second half, given a more difficult comp sales comparison in the first half.\n Turning to gross margin. As a reminder, gross margin in 2020 benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates in more clear and sensitive nonconsumables categories. As we move through 2021, we expect pressure in our gross margin rate as we anticipate a less favorable sales mix, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 and higher fuel and transportation costs. Also, please keep in mind, the second and third quarters represent our most challenging laps of the year from a gross margin rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.\n With regards to SG&A, while we continue to expect ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we currently anticipate a significant reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect about $60 million to $70 million incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives this year as we further their rollouts. This amount includes approximately $23 million in incremental investments made during the first quarter. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as our team continues to drive strong execution across our portfolio of growth initiatives. \n Let me take you through some of the more recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in over 7,300 stores at the end of Q1, and we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.\n We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we continue to see across our NCI product categories. Notably, this performance is contributing to an incremental comp sales increase in nonconsumable sales of 8% in our NCI stores and 3% in our NCI light stores as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Given our strong performance to date, coupled with the added flexibility of a more streamlined approach, our plans now include completing the rollout of NCI across nearly all of the chain by year-end 2022.\n Moving to our newest concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 3 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 8. And while still early, we continue to be very pleased with the initial results, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin.\n In fact, year 1 annualized sales volumes for our first 8 locations are trending between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, with an average gross margin rate of about 40% which we expect will climb as we continue to scale this exciting initiative. As a reminder, this compares to year 1 sales volumes of about $1.4 million for a traditional Dollar General store and a gross margin rate of about 32% for the overall chain in 2020.\n For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores. Importantly, we currently estimate there are about 3,000 pOpshelf store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States. And when combined with pOpshelf's compelling unit economics, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is the strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated products. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on these items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DC Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. And we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the continued rollout of additional products, including both national and private brands. In total, at the end of Q1, we were delivering to more than 17,000 stores from 10 facilities and now expect to complete our initial rollout across the chain by the end of Q2, which is ahead of our previous expectation of year-end as communicated on our Q4 call.\n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we added nearly 18,000 cooler doors across our store base and are on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high-capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh.\n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed a total of 836 real estate projects, including 260 new stores, 543 remodels and 33 relocations. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,300 stores.\n For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also now plan to add produce in more than 1,000 stores, which compares to our previous expectation of approximately 700 stores. As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing 2 of our larger footprint formats, which each comprise about 8,500 square feet of selling space as our base prototypes for nearly all new stores going forward.\n With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section with about 30% more feet of selling space and produce in select stores.\n We are especially pleased with the sales productivity of these larger formats as average sales per square foot are currently trending about 15% above an average traditional store, which bodes well for the future as we look to grow these unit counts in the years ahead. In total, we expect more than 550 of our real estate projects this year will be in these formats as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition while driving additional growth.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. One such example is contactless payment, which is now available in the vast majority of the chain, further extending our convenience proposition, particularly for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of digital engagement and customer loyalty.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach where our goals include: increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts, both around rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to even more efficient stocking of our stores.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 3,400 stores at the end of Q1, which represents more than double the store count at the end of Q4. And we are pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback both from customers and employees.\n Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we are focused on introducing this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022 as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition while extending our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to pursue innovative opportunities to further develop our teams, including our recent announcement to partner with a leading training provider to deliver more personalized training solutions to our employees. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our organization and are an important driver of our consistent and strong execution.\n At the store level, we continue to be pleased with our robust internal promotion pipeline and store manager turnover, which continues to trend below historic levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders.\n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance, and we are pleased with our strong first quarter results, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. \n I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the business, a look maybe 1 year later or 1 year after this COVID started. Can you talk about the traffic? I know the rural store bases across retail seem to do well. Can you talk about how you're doing on the lap? And then anything changing in the basket that you're seeing, whether you're doing well and still in the consumables or how the basket may be evolving? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Simeon, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with what we're seeing [indiscernible] now a year out of the pandemic or again, lapping the pandemic, maybe a better term. When you look at it, what we've seen is those customers that we were able to bring in during the COVID crisis or the heat of it, we have retained a very large portion, better than what we had anticipated doing. As you may recall, we launched a very aggressive, back in that August-September time frame, an aggressive campaign to not only retain but keep her engaged at Dollar General. And that seems to be working very, very nicely.\n But as we've indicated in the past, when we see that our core consumer has more money to spend and stimulus has given her some of that tailwind, if you will, what she tends to do is contract on the number of visits but spends a lot more, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw our basket size increase very nicely with our core consumer as well as with these trade-in consumers that we saw during the heat of the battle of COVID that we've been able to retain. So it really sets us up nicely as we continue to move through this year. We feel very good about what we're seeing. And we're staying squarely focused on what we can control here and that's driving profitable sales growth. \nSimeon Gutman: And the 2-year stack, I think if I did the math right, or if I heard the numbers right, I think it's running now 14 in May, if that's right. What are the puts and takes to that? I think there's a little more stimulus coming. Do you think this could be the run rate that you can hold going forward? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. In terms of -- you're right in terms of the stack in terms of the cadence. If you look at the cadence of the quarter, it picked up nicely with the onset of the stimulus, where we're very well positioned to get more than our fair share of that. You did see sequentially on a 2-year stack basis, it moderates somewhat but remain very strong and very strong across the board when you look at 2-year stacks, both on the nonconsumables as well as the consumables but particularly when you look at the nonconsumables, just a fantastic 2-year stack as we shared.\n And I think that really speaks to the strength of what we've done with the initiatives on both the consumable side of the business to provide that fuller fill-in trip grocery shop as well as on the nonconsumable side to get a fair share of these folks coming in as we take share from specialty retail. As we look ahead, the laps get actually easier in the back half of the year from a comp standpoint but we just feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on the performance. So Todd, maybe just take a step back. Could you speak to new customer acquisition that you're seeing in market share that you see driving the performance continuing? And maybe on that taking a step back, how would you compare what you're seeing today to maybe the time at which we were exiting the financial crisis as we think about customer acquisition, new households shopping Dollar General? And then if you were to rank, where do you see market share opportunities by category from here? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Matt, I'll try to weave all that in. But I would tell you that we're very happy with what we see on that customer acquisition side. Let me try to go to one part of your question, that is financial crisis coming out of that compared to what we are seeing now on the back side of COVID. Very similar from the standpoint that, that consumer is still very engaged. I think the biggest difference here is the amount of stimulus that is in the system right now.\n So our core shopper continues to be -- have a lot more money than she normally would, and she's spending a great deal of that with us, which is great to see. And I think the other side of the equation is that, that trade-in shopper is financially doing pretty well as the economy opens back up. As we can see, it's opening up in a very robust manner. And I think the difference of '08 and now is that, that consumer has more money to spend. And the great thing is she continues to come back to Dollar General, that higher-income shopper and shop with us. And that's exactly what we saw in '08 but in a way, she didn't have a lot of money. This time, she does have money but still continues to shop.\n So I think that just speaks to the relevancy that we've built in this box since that '08 crisis. This box, as you know, has transformed tremendously since then. So we feel good about those trends and our core shopper trends.\n As it relates to market share, we're seeing gains across the board. Drug continues to be our #1 donor share. Grocery is donating as well as, I think, consumers start to go back to some normal shopping patterns as it relates to food at home. And we're seeing those come back to Dollar General in a nice way. And then even in our own space, we're taking share, which is great to see.\n So it's really across the board. And I think it's a real testament to the initiatives that we put in place years ago. This isn't a -- just because of COVID, this underlying business, as I've said before, is as strong as I've ever seen it. \nMatthew Boss: Todd, maybe as a follow-up to that, what inning would you characterize those key initiatives? If we think about DG Fresh, NCI, private label, I think you have a laundry list that you've walked through. But what inning would you characterize overall these initiatives as we think going forward? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, you heard Jeff's prepared remarks. But if I step back and take a look at NCI as an example, we'll be completely rolled out by the end of '22. So I would tell you, we're probably halfway through the game as we go through this year and then into next, which feels really good.\n In our cooler initiative and DG Fresh just in general, I would tell you that we're in the -- we're still in the fourth inning, maybe closer to the bottom of the fourth inning but still in the fourth inning. We've got a lot of runway ahead of us there. And that's been the largest contributor on our initiative side that we've seen both on the top line and bottom line. And the great thing is that we've got a lot of runway yet to go there.\n pOpshelf, I mean we're just coming up to bat. We're really happy with what we're seeing there. And we supplied a little more color. Hopefully, it was helpful on what we're seeing early on in our sales and margin coming out of there. And we're very, very encouraged there. And I would tell you, as you know Dollar General pretty well, as we start to see more evidence that this is a very good initiative, we can go very quickly. So stay tuned on that.\n And our digital side, this will be an ongoing initiative. But I would tell you, we're in the infancy stages, very early innings on our initiatives there in and around digital. So a tremendous amount of opportunity, both top line and bottom line because these initiatives are aimed at both. And that's the -- I think that's the important aspect here is that we're controlling every line of that P&L. \nMatthew Boss: Great. It sounds like a lot of balls still to play. Best of luck. \nTodd Vasos: Absolutely. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I wanted to see if you could give a little color in terms of the May sales trends with respect to discretionary versus consumables. And I do have a question related to how you answer that from a bigger picture perspective. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. So if you look at May, we gave the May -- through the 23rd, comp sales were down 7%, but obviously, as we mentioned, a pretty strong 2-year stack in the 14th. There was a question also in terms of did that month-to-date differ from the full month, and it didn't change much at all. So strong performance continued and we saw continued strength in our nonconsumables, but also the consumables when you look at a 2-year stack, so very strong performance from both sides of the box. \nKaren Short: Okay. So just bigger picture, when I look at your mix in discretionary, you're up almost 200 basis points -- well, 200 basis points since 2018 in terms of mix shift in discretionary. So -- and I guess, when you look at your overall gross margins, it seems -- and you've talked to the fact that there is significant opportunity on the gross margin front.\n So I guess what I'm wondering is looking maybe a year or 2 out, what do you think the discretionary mix could be within your sales? And then how should we think about gross margins as we look into 2022? I mean, I realize '21 has some very tough compares than 2022. \nJohn Garratt: Karen, I think as you look at the nonconsumables business, obviously, there's some tailwind that you got from -- during the pandemic and from the stimulus. But I would just point to the ongoing strength that we've shown there. We've delivered comp growth in nonconsumables for 12 consecutive quarters, and I think that just really speaks to the relevance we've put into that piece of the box. And as you continue to see the share we're taking, how we're outperforming others.\n We have noted that the lap does get tougher as we get into Q2. You're lapping sales growth in the nonconsumables category of 40.8% last year. So that's a tough lap, puts pressure on that. But I would tell you, we feel great about the nonconsumables business as we look forward and as we continue to scale that, almost doubling that this year and then taking the best of the best from that, importing that across the chain and then taking the learnings from that and putting that into pOpshelf and then cross-pollinating the best ideas between the 2. We feel fantastic about that business. \nKaren Short: And any thoughts on how -- what would be a normalized -- or not normalized, but how that -- how we should think about gross margins going into 2022? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. Obviously, we're not giving '22 guidance just yet. But what I'd tell you is this, is you look at the performance in gross margin. We've delivered 8 consecutive quarters of gross margin growth, up 208 basis points this quarter, lapping 49 basis points this quarter last year. And when you look at the drivers of that, again, there was some tailwind from nonconsumables from the stimulus.\n But when you look at the drivers, it's the strategic initiatives driving that. The top 3, we've been talking about these top 3 for several quarters now. It's higher initial markups, that's DG Fresh driving that. And that is a gift that keeps on giving as we scale that, complete that across the chain and then drive efficiency than that.\n The next 2 we talked about were lower markdowns and the mix benefit. And again, you got some extra tailwind from the stimulus, but it's nonconsumables driving that and that's been a consistent driver for some time now. And then you look at shrink, shrink was another benefit. Now as you look at the near term, as I mentioned, we hit a very difficult lap around nonconsumables, which will pressure that year-over-year mix even though we feel great about the nonconsumables.\n And then as others have talked about it, we do see pressures this year associated with transportation costs, but we do believe that's more of a near-term pressure, not something structural that will last forever. And so as we push through those 2 pressure points, we feel good about what we've been doing in terms of driving gross margin and operating margin expansion and our ability to keep doing so, not only with these strategic initiatives I mentioned but then all the other drivers we talk about, not just shrink but private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies we continue to drive to mitigate the pressures that others are seeing and so it's not as impactful to us.\n And then we always talk about our buying power. And then last but not least, we will invest in price if needed, if warranted. But I can tell you, we feel like we're in a great pricing position right now and don't see the need to. So we feel good about our ability to drive it higher over time, both gross margin and operating margin overall. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Nice quarter. Maybe the first one turns out to be a little bit of a follow-up now. But as it relates to product cost inflation, can you just talk about what you are seeing and what you're expecting from product cost inflation standpoint, especially in consumables? And then what are your expectations for pass-through? And to what extent are you in the driver seat? To what extent do you kind of need to follow what Walmart does? Are you seeing anything out there to suggest that you wouldn't be able to pass through higher product cost inflation if that happens? \nJeffery Owen: Ed, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Certainly, on the product cost, on the first part of that question, what I would tell you is that our merchants have done a fantastic job of partnering with our suppliers. And this is where the model at Dollar General really performs well in the sense that our scale and our limited SKU assortment allows us the opportunity to really find innovative ways to protect that underserved customer and certainly find ways that we can mitigate the cost pressures. But certainly, as many retailers have talked about, we have seen that.\n But again, real pleased with our pricing position. We feel really good about where we are. We talked about this before. We've made some strategic decisions last year to get in some of the best pricing position we've been. And so feel good about where we are. We'll continue to fight for that customer every day. As you know, here at Dollar General, price and value are so important to her and we're here to serve her. So I'm really pleased with where they are. We'll continue to monitor that but feel good about the team's performance to date on that front. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just one on labor cost here. Can you just provide some color on what you're seeing out there? I mean, obviously, a lot of companies have talked about challenges. You grow a lot, so you're adding a lot of employees. Has it caused you to rethink wage levels at all? Do you see this as transitory? Just how do we think about the pressure there and how that's changing? \nJeffery Owen: Ed, we have seen some pressure as many retailers have said. But you know what, I'm so proud of what our team has done to respond. And certainly, in April, we announced our national hiring event with a goal to hire up to 20,000 additional employees. And I'm very pleased that already we have beaten that goal by 50%. So I think it points to the thing we've said all along, and that is Dollar General is such an amazing place to start a career.\n And so again, we feel real good about the opportunity we can provide with over 12,000 store managers internally promoted. We've got a robust internal pipeline. We still be -- we're still able to attract, so we feel real good there. And certainly, as we have always talked here at Dollar General, we're surgical in the way that we respond to different challenges. So the comments you've mentioned, we're not seeing it widespread. There are pockets, and so we'll certainly tailor our solution to where it makes sense.\n We always pay competitive wages. We have and we will continue to. And still very pleased at our turnover rates that point to this opportunity here at Dollar General to attract folks, provide a great growth opportunity. And so right now, we are certainly making progress mitigating these challenges, and I'm really pleased with the progress I'm seeing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Your 2-year compound annual growth for consumables grew 12% in the fourth quarter -- 12% in the third and fourth quarter last year. You grew [ 11% ] in the first quarter [indiscernible] only by 100 basis points. How much of that slowdown would you attribute to consumers going back out to eat and so they don't need to visit Dollar General as often for those [ same ] interests? Or how much is it your expectation that some of that is due to consumers got a $1,400 check at least. And so they might be going to Walmart or Target or some other discretionary retailer and rolling up on a big-ticket item, and while they're there, purchasing other goods that's taking away a trip from Dollar General? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. It was very difficult, Michael, to understand you and the question. But if I got some of the sense of it, yes, we feel good about our consumable and nonconsumable businesses where they're at. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to take share from all different classes of trade out there. So I feel better than I ever have on being able to continue to drive the top line on both our consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. And if I missed that question or if you like to ask it again, I'm happy to answer it. \nMichael Lasser: The question is your 2-year compound annual growth rate for your consumables business slowed modestly from 4Q to 1Q. How much do you attribute that to the people going back out to eat so they don't need to fill in [indiscernible]? Or they got a $1,400 check, so now they're going to Walmart to buy a TV and while they're there, they're filling up their basket, which may also be taking away a fill-in trip from DG. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I apologize, Michael. Thank you for repeating that. Yes, I would tell you, it's definitely not the latter that we've seen. It's probably more -- the little slowdown that we have seen there was one, such a robust last year and even into the fourth quarter. The economy is opening up a little bit. So that consumer has the ability to go do some other things.\n And food away from home, I'm sure, like yourself, a lot of people wanted to get out and get out of the house, so I think that definitely played into Q1. What we're already seeing though in early Q2 is that some of that food at home is being -- it looks like it's pretty sticky. And while I'm not ready to talk about Q2 right now, I can tell you that especially in those areas like DG Fresh, our perishable areas, we're seeing very, very nice sales, robust sales in there. So it really shows that, that consumer still has a propensity to have food at home.\n And I would tell you, just like anything, when things last more than a quarter or 2 or half a year, they become pretty ingrained. And I think food at home has become pretty ingrained. Now that doesn't mean that they won't go out to eat, but I think they're going to be doing more food at home than they had prior to the pandemic. And we're already seeing that, as I mentioned, start to materialize here in Q2. \nMichael Lasser: Got it. On the gross margin, 200-plus basis points, John. You did provide the order of magnitude. But could you put a quantification around how much of the gross margin was due to factors that have been driven by your initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI, which should continue? Is it 100 basis points over the next couple of quarters versus other factors that might be temporary such as mix or lack of promotions within the environment? And are you already starting to see more promotions come back such that, that could be a risk factor to offset those factors that you have within your control over the next few quarters? \nJohn Garratt: Yes, Michael. So as you look -- as you pointed out, those are in the order of importance and the #1 called out, and it was a good bit higher than the other 2, although all were quite impactful, was higher initial markups, and that was DG Fresh. And that is something I would say continues and actually improves as we scale that across the system and get the efficiencies.\n As you get to the next 2, the lower markdowns, certainly a big piece of that was the higher sell-through on the nonconsumables. But if you recall, we were calling out lower markdowns even before that as we got tighter and tighter around promotional activity, and we've stayed tight on promotional activity. While I would say compared to last year, it's up a little bit because last year there was virtually no promotional activity. If you compare to 2019, it's down. So we're not seeing that much more promotional activity. We're actually seeing a little bit less. If you go back to 2019, there just was none last year. And so things remain pretty tame that way.\n And then on the mix benefit, again, certainly got some extra juice from the stimulus. But again, 12 consecutive quarters of nonconsumable comp growth. And when we're virtually doubling that initiative and putting the best of the best across the chain, we think that continues to help us. And again, shrink, that was a benefit not related to the current environment.\n So it's certainly a mix. It's hard to when you look at nonconsumables to untangle what was stimulus and what was just what we did to make that piece of the box more relevant. I'd say we set ourselves up very well in that regard. And then again, I would like to think that the higher carry rates is more -- is not something structural. It's more of a supply and demand imbalance that should sort itself out later.\n One of the things I'll mention that is a wildcard that's not in our guidance, and that is what impact the child tax credits will have. And so while there's -- we've not assumed any more stimulus, we've not assumed any more child tax credits, just given the number of potential macro puts and takes, including the child tax credits, but then conversely, what happens when the -- some of the enhanced benefits are removed. So that's another wildcard in the back portion of the year.\n But as you look at the gross margin, I would tell you, a big chunk of this is structural as evidenced by the strong fundamentals driving it and the track record we've delivered. But as we mentioned, there's just some near-term pressures over the next few quarters. \nMichael Lasser: That's very helpful. Could I just clarify what you -- one point you made that you're not -- you're seeing promotions better today than they were in 2019? So you're not seeing conventional grocery stores promote more because their sales are under -- on decline as consumers go out to eat more? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. We watch this very closely, Michael. And I would tell you, John hit it right on the head, and that is we're seeing a little bit more promotional activity than we did last year because it was absolutely none last year. But it is substantially, substantially lower than it was in 2019. And so I would tell you that, that tame promotional environment that we've been talking about even prior to the pandemic and through the pandemic still persists. We have not seen that whatsoever. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. \nRupesh Parikh: So my first question is with the comp guide. I was curious how you guys are thinking about traffic for the balance of the year. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I think the way you think about traffic, we've been talking about this, there's been quite a bit of trip consolidation. So people have been coming in a little less frequently. They've been putting a lot more in their basket. Now what I would tell you is we looked across recent periods, we've seen the traffic start to pick up. And so what we would expect as the mobility picks up, the traffic will pick up. The baskets will come down somewhat, but our goal is to hold as much of that bigger basket that we gained.\n It's pretty impressive when you look at the 2-year stacks on the growing basket on top of basket growth last year, again, as we provide -- position ourselves to that fuller fill-in trip. But what we would expect is that traffic to continue to pick up as people get out more. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up on pOpshelf. So clearly, very upbeat commentary in terms of what you guys are seeing so far. So I guess, Todd, what has surprised you so far with the concept? \nTodd Vasos: I'm sorry, what was the question? \nRupesh Parikh: Yes, on pOpshelf, you guys have seen very strong results so far. So I was just curious what has surprised you so far with the performance there? \nTodd Vasos: Oh, surprise. Yes. I would tell you that we're very happy with what we're seeing. I believe that the biggest surprise probably was when you launch a brand from ground zero, you don't normally see the amount of traction and sustained traction that we are seeing and repeat customers that we're seeing.\n The other thing that's really a surprise is the customer feedback that we're getting. We're getting promoter scores in the upper 80s and 90% range, which is unheard of. And so that's what gives us great optimist, if you will -- optimistic that we will continue to be able to grow this piece. Stay tuned.\n And as I mentioned earlier, because of what we're seeing not only on the sales line, but I think the other nice surprise was on that margin side at 40% margins. And I would tell you, the upside to that is great, very great, quite frankly, as we scale this. So we think that between those 2, and you know us well, we'll move fast in store openings once we get another few weeks behind our belt here. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: Seeing that pOpshelf, it's just an insane format, one of the best I've seen in about 20 years, so I look forward to hearing more about it. But my actual question is on DGX, you guys didn't mention it. Maybe not as much sizzle as the pOpshelf but seems like it almost could supplant the normal convenience stores. It's about 10,000 7-Elevens. And I look at that store and say, \"Gosh, like, why would I ever go to a 7-Eleven if there was a DGX in the neighborhood?\" \nJeffery Owen: Scott, thank you for the question. And we are real excited about DGX. And certainly, as we talked before, during the pandemic, as you remember, DGX is situated to locate where you work and play. And certainly during the pandemic, we saw some pullback, obviously, with so much remote and work at home. But we feel real good about what we're seeing now. We've talked earlier about how we're seeing the economy kind of open up and folks get out more and we're seeing that come back nicely in our DGX stores.\n And so you're right. We're very excited. You'll recall last conference call, we talked about the opportunity for 1,000 possible DGX locations across the country. And then you know us well. If we find a concept that can work even better and increase that over time, we'll certainly try to do that. But right now, the offering inside the DGX, we also have very high customer satisfaction scores like the pOpshelf brand as well. We are real pleased with what the customer is saying and we're also pleased with the opportunity. So stay tuned, but that just gives us yet another leg of growth.\n So you got pOpshelf where we've talked about incremental 3,000 opportunities; DGX, an incremental 1,000 opportunities; and then our traditional fleet where we believe there's 13,000 additional opportunities. So 17,000 opportunities in total gives us great confidence that we can continue to grow this great brand across the country. So we're really excited about what the future holds there. \nScott Mushkin: And if I could have a follow-up -- I guess I get a follow-up. On the pricing side, kind of taking that and turning it on its ear a little bit. I mean if you look at what's going on in your business, you obviously talked about gross margin expansion possibilities as well as labor efficiency possibilities and, of course, the limited SKUs you guys offer. Why wouldn't I think that you can use -- and we've seen this, our pricing surveys kind of coming -- the gap coming down with Walmart. Why wouldn't we see that continuing? Like you have a lot of levers to pull. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. We watch it very closely. You know us pretty well. And pricing is one of my pet projects here at Dollar General. I'm intimately involved in it because it's so important to our consumer. And I would tell you that, and Jeff alluded to it again, we took 2020 and we quietly got in the best position we've ever been in. We took advantage of that dislocation that was out there.\n And that advantage continues today. And to your point, we've made inroads even against all classes of trade, including mass. But also especially even in our class of trade here at discount, we've made extreme moves as well. So we're happy with what we -- where we are. Hey, we always reserve the right to continue to make sure our customer has the ability to shop what she needs. So if that does need to happen, we have the wherewithal to do anything on price that we consider we need to do. But right now, we feel good.\n And as Jeff indicated, even in this environment where we're seeing some price pressure from CPG like other retailers are, we have a lot of levers at our disposal to make sure that we don't have to pass all that on to the consumer.

            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2021, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to supporting our customers, communities and each other. As a testament to their efforts, our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, reflecting strong underlying performance across the business, which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\n The quarter was highlighted by net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories, a 208 basis point increase in gross margin rate and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment, we are increasing our sales and diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2021 to reflect our strong first quarter performance. John will provide additional details on our outlook during his remarks.\n As always, the health and safety of our employees and customers continue to be a top priority while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve. And we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, including our network of more than 17,000 stores located within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. \n Overall, we are executing well against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\n Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter. As we lapped our most difficult quarterly comp sales comparison of the year, net sales decreased 0.6% to $8.4 billion, driven by a comp sales decline of 4.6%. Notably, comp sales on a 2-year stack basis increased a robust 17.1%, which compares to the 15.9% 2-year stack we delivered last quarter. \n Our first quarter sales results include a decline in customer traffic, which was partially offset by growth in average basket size. And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they continue to spend more with us compared to last year.\n From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales increased 5.7% in February despite a headwind from inclement weather across the country. For the month of March, which represents our most difficult monthly sales comparison of the year, comp sales declined 11.2%. Importantly, beginning in mid-March and in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw a meaningful acceleration in sales relative to the first 2 weeks of the month, especially in our nonconsumable categories. Comp sales declined 4.3% in April. And while year-over-year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to March, they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap.\n Overall, each of our 3 nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter. Of note, comp sales growth of 11.3% in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8% on a comparable 2-year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories, enhanced by the benefit from stimulus. Once again this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data.\n Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. In addition, we recently published our third annual Serving Others report, which provides context related to our ongoing ESG efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead.\n Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and believe we are well positioned to continue advancing our goal of further differentiating and distancing Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\n As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock even more growth opportunities as we move forward. In short, I feel very good about the underlying business, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. Yes. Simeon, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with what we're seeing [indiscernible] now a year out of the pandemic or again, lapping the pandemic, maybe a better term. When you look at it, what we've seen is those customers that we were able to bring in during the COVID crisis or the heat of it, we have retained a very large portion, better than what we had anticipated doing. As you may recall, we launched a very aggressive, back in that August-September time frame, an aggressive campaign to not only retain but keep her engaged at Dollar General. And that seems to be working very, very nicely.\n But as we've indicated in the past, when we see that our core consumer has more money to spend and stimulus has given her some of that tailwind, if you will, what she tends to do is contract on the number of visits but spends a lot more, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw our basket size increase very nicely with our core consumer as well as with these trade-in consumers that we saw during the heat of the battle of COVID that we've been able to retain. So it really sets us up nicely as we continue to move through this year. We feel very good about what we're seeing. And we're staying squarely focused on what we can control here and that's driving profitable sales growth. Yes, Matt, I'll try to weave all that in. But I would tell you that we're very happy with what we see on that customer acquisition side. Let me try to go to one part of your question, that is financial crisis coming out of that compared to what we are seeing now on the back side of COVID. Very similar from the standpoint that, that consumer is still very engaged. I think the biggest difference here is the amount of stimulus that is in the system right now.\n So our core shopper continues to be -- have a lot more money than she normally would, and she's spending a great deal of that with us, which is great to see. And I think the other side of the equation is that, that trade-in shopper is financially doing pretty well as the economy opens back up. As we can see, it's opening up in a very robust manner. And I think the difference of '08 and now is that, that consumer has more money to spend. And the great thing is she continues to come back to Dollar General, that higher-income shopper and shop with us. And that's exactly what we saw in '08 but in a way, she didn't have a lot of money. This time, she does have money but still continues to shop.\n So I think that just speaks to the relevancy that we've built in this box since that '08 crisis. This box, as you know, has transformed tremendously since then. So we feel good about those trends and our core shopper trends.\n As it relates to market share, we're seeing gains across the board. Drug continues to be our #1 donor share. Grocery is donating as well as, I think, consumers start to go back to some normal shopping patterns as it relates to food at home. And we're seeing those come back to Dollar General in a nice way. And then even in our own space, we're taking share, which is great to see.\n So it's really across the board. And I think it's a real testament to the initiatives that we put in place years ago. This isn't a -- just because of COVID, this underlying business, as I've said before, is as strong as I've ever seen it. Yes, you heard Jeff's prepared remarks. But if I step back and take a look at NCI as an example, we'll be completely rolled out by the end of '22. So I would tell you, we're probably halfway through the game as we go through this year and then into next, which feels really good.\n In our cooler initiative and DG Fresh just in general, I would tell you that we're in the -- we're still in the fourth inning, maybe closer to the bottom of the fourth inning but still in the fourth inning. We've got a lot of runway ahead of us there. And that's been the largest contributor on our initiative side that we've seen both on the top line and bottom line. And the great thing is that we've got a lot of runway yet to go there.\n pOpshelf, I mean we're just coming up to bat. We're really happy with what we're seeing there. And we supplied a little more color. Hopefully, it was helpful on what we're seeing early on in our sales and margin coming out of there. And we're very, very encouraged there. And I would tell you, as you know Dollar General pretty well, as we start to see more evidence that this is a very good initiative, we can go very quickly. So stay tuned on that.\n And our digital side, this will be an ongoing initiative. But I would tell you, we're in the infancy stages, very early innings on our initiatives there in and around digital. So a tremendous amount of opportunity, both top line and bottom line because these initiatives are aimed at both. And that's the -- I think that's the important aspect here is that we're controlling every line of that P&L. Absolutely. Yes. It was very difficult, Michael, to understand you and the question. But if I got some of the sense of it, yes, we feel good about our consumable and nonconsumable businesses where they're at. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to take share from all different classes of trade out there. So I feel better than I ever have on being able to continue to drive the top line on both our consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. And if I missed that question or if you like to ask it again, I'm happy to answer it. Yes. I apologize, Michael. Thank you for repeating that. Yes, I would tell you, it's definitely not the latter that we've seen. It's probably more -- the little slowdown that we have seen there was one, such a robust last year and even into the fourth quarter. The economy is opening up a little bit. So that consumer has the ability to go do some other things.\n And food away from home, I'm sure, like yourself, a lot of people wanted to get out and get out of the house, so I think that definitely played into Q1. What we're already seeing though in early Q2 is that some of that food at home is being -- it looks like it's pretty sticky. And while I'm not ready to talk about Q2 right now, I can tell you that especially in those areas like DG Fresh, our perishable areas, we're seeing very, very nice sales, robust sales in there. So it really shows that, that consumer still has a propensity to have food at home.\n And I would tell you, just like anything, when things last more than a quarter or 2 or half a year, they become pretty ingrained. And I think food at home has become pretty ingrained. Now that doesn't mean that they won't go out to eat, but I think they're going to be doing more food at home than they had prior to the pandemic. And we're already seeing that, as I mentioned, start to materialize here in Q2. Yes. We watch this very closely, Michael. And I would tell you, John hit it right on the head, and that is we're seeing a little bit more promotional activity than we did last year because it was absolutely none last year. But it is substantially, substantially lower than it was in 2019. And so I would tell you that, that tame promotional environment that we've been talking about even prior to the pandemic and through the pandemic still persists. We have not seen that whatsoever. I'm sorry, what was the question? Oh, surprise. Yes. I would tell you that we're very happy with what we're seeing. I believe that the biggest surprise probably was when you launch a brand from ground zero, you don't normally see the amount of traction and sustained traction that we are seeing and repeat customers that we're seeing.\n The other thing that's really a surprise is the customer feedback that we're getting. We're getting promoter scores in the upper 80s and 90% range, which is unheard of. And so that's what gives us great optimist, if you will -- optimistic that we will continue to be able to grow this piece. Stay tuned.\n And as I mentioned earlier, because of what we're seeing not only on the sales line, but I think the other nice surprise was on that margin side at 40% margins. And I would tell you, the upside to that is great, very great, quite frankly, as we scale this. So we think that between those 2, and you know us well, we'll move fast in store openings once we get another few weeks behind our belt here. Yes. We watch it very closely. You know us pretty well. And pricing is one of my pet projects here at Dollar General. I'm intimately involved in it because it's so important to our consumer. And I would tell you that, and Jeff alluded to it again, we took 2020 and we quietly got in the best position we've ever been in. We took advantage of that dislocation that was out there.\n And that advantage continues today. And to your point, we've made inroads even against all classes of trade, including mass. But also especially even in our class of trade here at discount, we've made extreme moves as well. So we're happy with what we -- where we are. Hey, we always reserve the right to continue to make sure our customer has the ability to shop what she needs. So if that does need to happen, we have the wherewithal to do anything on price that we consider we need to do. But right now, we feel good.\n And as Jeff indicated, even in this environment where we're seeing some price pressure from CPG like other retailers are, we have a lot of levers at our disposal to make sure that we don't have to pass all that on to the consumer. And that's exactly what you've seen here in Q1 so far."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which we believe was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant benefit to sales, particularly in our nonconsumables categories from the most recent round of government stimulus payments.\n Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8% in the first quarter. As Todd noted, this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to: higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs, which were primarily driven by higher rates.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%, an increase of 152 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales, the most significant of which were store occupancy costs, disaster expenses related to Winter Storm Uri, retail labor and depreciation and amortization.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $908.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 10.8%, an increase of 56 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% and compares to 22.2% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter increased 10.2% to $2.82, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38% over a 2-year period.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 24.2% overall and a 17.6% increase on a per store basis as we cycled a 5.5% decline in inventory on a per store basis, driven by extremely strong sales volumes in Q1 2020.\n In anticipation of a more challenging supply environment, we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter, particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business. And while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory.\n The business generated significant cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $703 million, a decrease of 60% but which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 11% over a 2-year period. This decrease was primarily driven by higher levels of inventory as a result of improving inventory positions, including the pull forward of certain inventory purchases I mentioned earlier.\n Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $278 million and included: our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations; distribution and transportation projects; and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1 billion and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $100 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.7 billion.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty, as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our full year guidance for sales and EPS due to our strong Q1 outperformance, which we believe was aided by the latest round of stimulus.\n For 2021, we now expect the following: net sales in the range of a 1% decline to an increase of 1%; a same-store sales decline of 5% to 3% but which reflects growth of approximately 11% to 13% on a 2-year stack basis; and EPS in the range of $9.50 to $10.20, which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of approximately 20% to 24% or in the range of approximately 19% to 23% compared to the 2019 adjusted diluted EPS over a 2-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%.\n With regards to share repurchases, we now expect to repurchase approximately $2.2 billion of our common stock this year compared to our previous expectation of about $1.8 billion. \n Finally, our 2021 outlook for capital spending and real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q4 2020 earnings release on March 18, 2021.\n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our full year outlook. First, there could be additional headwinds and tailwinds this year, the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business of which are currently unclear, including but not limited to the potential impacts from legislation and regulatory agency actions. Given the unusual situation, I will now elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in May.\n From the end of Q1 through May 23, comp sales declined by approximately 7% as we continue to cycle extremely difficult prior year comparisons. As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of May in 2020 was 21.5%. And while we are nonetheless encouraged with our sales trends, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued uncertainty that still exists, the unique comparisons against last year and the anticipation of fading tailwinds from the most recent round of government stimulus. That said, as you think about the comp sales cadence of 2021, we continue to expect our performance to be better in the second half, given a more difficult comp sales comparison in the first half.\n Turning to gross margin. As a reminder, gross margin in 2020 benefited from a favorable sales mix and a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates in more clear and sensitive nonconsumables categories. As we move through 2021, we expect pressure in our gross margin rate as we anticipate a less favorable sales mix, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 and higher fuel and transportation costs. Also, please keep in mind, the second and third quarters represent our most challenging laps of the year from a gross margin rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.\n With regards to SG&A, while we continue to expect ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we currently anticipate a significant reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect about $60 million to $70 million incremental year-over-year investments in our strategic initiatives this year as we further their rollouts. This amount includes approximately $23 million in incremental investments made during the first quarter. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n In closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in another quarter of exceptional results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Yes. In terms of -- you're right in terms of the stack in terms of the cadence. If you look at the cadence of the quarter, it picked up nicely with the onset of the stimulus, where we're very well positioned to get more than our fair share of that. You did see sequentially on a 2-year stack basis, it moderates somewhat but remain very strong and very strong across the board when you look at 2-year stacks, both on the nonconsumables as well as the consumables but particularly when you look at the nonconsumables, just a fantastic 2-year stack as we shared.\n And I think that really speaks to the strength of what we've done with the initiatives on both the consumable side of the business to provide that fuller fill-in trip grocery shop as well as on the nonconsumable side to get a fair share of these folks coming in as we take share from specialty retail. As we look ahead, the laps get actually easier in the back half of the year from a comp standpoint but we just feel fantastic about the fundamentals of the business. Yes. So if you look at May, we gave the May -- through the 23rd, comp sales were down 7%, but obviously, as we mentioned, a pretty strong 2-year stack in the 14th. There was a question also in terms of did that month-to-date differ from the full month, and it didn't change much at all. So strong performance continued and we saw continued strength in our nonconsumables, but also the consumables when you look at a 2-year stack, so very strong performance from both sides of the box. Karen, I think as you look at the nonconsumables business, obviously, there's some tailwind that you got from -- during the pandemic and from the stimulus. But I would just point to the ongoing strength that we've shown there. We've delivered comp growth in nonconsumables for 12 consecutive quarters, and I think that just really speaks to the relevance we've put into that piece of the box. And as you continue to see the share we're taking, how we're outperforming others.\n We have noted that the lap does get tougher as we get into Q2. You're lapping sales growth in the nonconsumables category of 40.8% last year. So that's a tough lap, puts pressure on that. But I would tell you, we feel great about the nonconsumables business as we look forward and as we continue to scale that, almost doubling that this year and then taking the best of the best from that, importing that across the chain and then taking the learnings from that and putting that into pOpshelf and then cross-pollinating the best ideas between the 2. We feel fantastic about that business. Yes. Obviously, we're not giving '22 guidance just yet. But what I'd tell you is this, is you look at the performance in gross margin. We've delivered 8 consecutive quarters of gross margin growth, up 208 basis points this quarter, lapping 49 basis points this quarter last year. And when you look at the drivers of that, again, there was some tailwind from nonconsumables from the stimulus.\n But when you look at the drivers, it's the strategic initiatives driving that. The top 3, we've been talking about these top 3 for several quarters now. It's higher initial markups, that's DG Fresh driving that. And that is a gift that keeps on giving as we scale that, complete that across the chain and then drive efficiency than that.\n The next 2 we talked about were lower markdowns and the mix benefit. And again, you got some extra tailwind from the stimulus, but it's nonconsumables driving that and that's been a consistent driver for some time now. And then you look at shrink, shrink was another benefit. Now as you look at the near term, as I mentioned, we hit a very difficult lap around nonconsumables, which will pressure that year-over-year mix even though we feel great about the nonconsumables.\n And then as others have talked about it, we do see pressures this year associated with transportation costs, but we do believe that's more of a near-term pressure, not something structural that will last forever. And so as we push through those 2 pressure points, we feel good about what we've been doing in terms of driving gross margin and operating margin expansion and our ability to keep doing so, not only with these strategic initiatives I mentioned but then all the other drivers we talk about, not just shrink but private brand penetration, foreign sourcing penetration, supply chain efficiencies we continue to drive to mitigate the pressures that others are seeing and so it's not as impactful to us.\n And then we always talk about our buying power. And then last but not least, we will invest in price if needed, if warranted. But I can tell you, we feel like we're in a great pricing position right now and don't see the need to. So we feel good about our ability to drive it higher over time, both gross margin and operating margin overall. Yes, Michael. So as you look -- as you pointed out, those are in the order of importance and the #1 called out, and it was a good bit higher than the other 2, although all were quite impactful, was higher initial markups, and that was DG Fresh. And that is something I would say continues and actually improves as we scale that across the system and get the efficiencies.\n As you get to the next 2, the lower markdowns, certainly a big piece of that was the higher sell-through on the nonconsumables. But if you recall, we were calling out lower markdowns even before that as we got tighter and tighter around promotional activity, and we've stayed tight on promotional activity. While I would say compared to last year, it's up a little bit because last year there was virtually no promotional activity. If you compare to 2019, it's down. So we're not seeing that much more promotional activity. We're actually seeing a little bit less. If you go back to 2019, there just was none last year. And so things remain pretty tame that way.\n And then on the mix benefit, again, certainly got some extra juice from the stimulus. But again, 12 consecutive quarters of nonconsumable comp growth. And when we're virtually doubling that initiative and putting the best of the best across the chain, we think that continues to help us. And again, shrink, that was a benefit not related to the current environment.\n So it's certainly a mix. It's hard to when you look at nonconsumables to untangle what was stimulus and what was just what we did to make that piece of the box more relevant. I'd say we set ourselves up very well in that regard. And then again, I would like to think that the higher carry rates is more -- is not something structural. It's more of a supply and demand imbalance that should sort itself out later.\n One of the things I'll mention that is a wildcard that's not in our guidance, and that is what impact the child tax credits will have. And so while there's -- we've not assumed any more stimulus, we've not assumed any more child tax credits, just given the number of potential macro puts and takes, including the child tax credits, but then conversely, what happens when the -- some of the enhanced benefits are removed. So that's another wildcard in the back portion of the year.\n But as you look at the gross margin, I would tell you, a big chunk of this is structural as evidenced by the strong fundamentals driving it and the track record we've delivered. But as we mentioned, there's just some near-term pressures over the next few quarters. Yes. I think the way you think about traffic, we've been talking about this, there's been quite a bit of trip consolidation. So people have been coming in a little less frequently. They've been putting a lot more in their basket. Now what I would tell you is we looked across recent periods, we've seen the traffic start to pick up. And so what we would expect as the mobility picks up, the traffic will pick up. The baskets will come down somewhat, but our goal is to hold as much of that bigger basket that we gained.\n It's pretty impressive when you look at the 2-year stacks on the growing basket on top of basket growth last year, again, as we provide -- position ourselves to that fuller fill-in trip. But what we would expect is that traffic to continue to pick up as people get out more."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as our team continues to drive strong execution across our portfolio of growth initiatives. \n Let me take you through some of the more recent highlights. Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI. As a reminder, NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in over 7,300 stores at the end of Q1, and we remain on track to expand this offering to a total of more than 11,000 stores by year-end, including over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.\n We're especially pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we continue to see across our NCI product categories. Notably, this performance is contributing to an incremental comp sales increase in nonconsumable sales of 8% in our NCI stores and 3% in our NCI light stores as compared to stores without the NCI offering. Given our strong performance to date, coupled with the added flexibility of a more streamlined approach, our plans now include completing the rollout of NCI across nearly all of the chain by year-end 2022.\n Moving to our newest concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 3 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 8. And while still early, we continue to be very pleased with the initial results, which have far exceeded our expectations for both sales and gross margin.\n In fact, year 1 annualized sales volumes for our first 8 locations are trending between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, with an average gross margin rate of about 40% which we expect will climb as we continue to scale this exciting initiative. As a reminder, this compares to year 1 sales volumes of about $1.4 million for a traditional Dollar General store and a gross margin rate of about 32% for the overall chain in 2020.\n For 2021, we remain on track to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf locations by year-end as well as up to an additional 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores. Importantly, we currently estimate there are about 3,000 pOpshelf store opportunities potentially available in the Continental United States. And when combined with pOpshelf's compelling unit economics, we remain very excited about the significant and incremental growth opportunities we see available for this unique and differentiated concept.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is the strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated products. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on these items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. In fact, DC Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases. And we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories, and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the continued rollout of additional products, including both national and private brands. In total, at the end of Q1, we were delivering to more than 17,000 stores from 10 facilities and now expect to complete our initial rollout across the chain by the end of Q2, which is ahead of our previous expectation of year-end as communicated on our Q4 call.\n Moving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During the quarter, we added nearly 18,000 cooler doors across our store base and are on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year. Notably, the majority of these doors will be in high-capacity coolers, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver an even wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh.\n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue other gross margin enhancing opportunities, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed a total of 836 real estate projects, including 260 new stores, 543 remodels and 33 relocations. In addition, we now have produce in more than 1,300 stores.\n For 2021, we remain on track to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total. We also now plan to add produce in more than 1,000 stores, which compares to our previous expectation of approximately 700 stores. As a reminder, we recently made key changes to our development strategy, including establishing 2 of our larger footprint formats, which each comprise about 8,500 square feet of selling space as our base prototypes for nearly all new stores going forward.\n With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section with about 30% more feet of selling space and produce in select stores.\n We are especially pleased with the sales productivity of these larger formats as average sales per square foot are currently trending about 15% above an average traditional store, which bodes well for the future as we look to grow these unit counts in the years ahead. In total, we expect more than 550 of our real estate projects this year will be in these formats as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition while driving additional growth.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. One such example is contactless payment, which is now available in the vast majority of the chain, further extending our convenience proposition, particularly for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. Going forward, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings, with the goal of driving even higher levels of digital engagement and customer loyalty.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach where our goals include: increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. We continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts, both around rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to even more efficient stocking of our stores.\n The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 3,400 stores at the end of Q1, which represents more than double the store count at the end of Q4. And we are pleased with our results, including customer adoption rates as well as positive feedback both from customers and employees.\n Our plans consist of a broader rollout this year, and we are focused on introducing this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022 as we look to further enhance our convenience proposition while extending our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to pursue innovative opportunities to further develop our teams, including our recent announcement to partner with a leading training provider to deliver more personalized training solutions to our employees. Importantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our organization and are an important driver of our consistent and strong execution.\n At the store level, we continue to be pleased with our robust internal promotion pipeline and store manager turnover, which continues to trend below historic levels. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders.\n In closing, I am proud of our team's performance, and we are pleased with our strong first quarter results, which further demonstrate that our unique combination of value and convenience continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward. \n I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 157,000 employees across the company for their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Ed, this is Jeff. Thanks for the question. Certainly, on the product cost, on the first part of that question, what I would tell you is that our merchants have done a fantastic job of partnering with our suppliers. And this is where the model at Dollar General really performs well in the sense that our scale and our limited SKU assortment allows us the opportunity to really find innovative ways to protect that underserved customer and certainly find ways that we can mitigate the cost pressures. But certainly, as many retailers have talked about, we have seen that.\n But again, real pleased with our pricing position. We feel really good about where we are. We talked about this before. We've made some strategic decisions last year to get in some of the best pricing position we've been. And so feel good about where we are. We'll continue to fight for that customer every day. As you know, here at Dollar General, price and value are so important to her and we're here to serve her. So I'm really pleased with where they are. We'll continue to monitor that but feel good about the team's performance to date on that front. Ed, we have seen some pressure as many retailers have said. But you know what, I'm so proud of what our team has done to respond. And certainly, in April, we announced our national hiring event with a goal to hire up to 20,000 additional employees. And I'm very pleased that already we have beaten that goal by 50%. So I think it points to the thing we've said all along, and that is Dollar General is such an amazing place to start a career.\n And so again, we feel real good about the opportunity we can provide with over 12,000 store managers internally promoted. We've got a robust internal pipeline. We still be -- we're still able to attract, so we feel real good there. And certainly, as we have always talked here at Dollar General, we're surgical in the way that we respond to different challenges. So the comments you've mentioned, we're not seeing it widespread. There are pockets, and so we'll certainly tailor our solution to where it makes sense.\n We always pay competitive wages. We have and we will continue to. And still very pleased at our turnover rates that point to this opportunity here at Dollar General to attract folks, provide a great growth opportunity. And so right now, we are certainly making progress mitigating these challenges, and I'm really pleased with the progress I'm seeing. Scott, thank you for the question. And we are real excited about DGX. And certainly, as we talked before, during the pandemic, as you remember, DGX is situated to locate where you work and play. And certainly during the pandemic, we saw some pullback, obviously, with so much remote and work at home. But we feel real good about what we're seeing now. We've talked earlier about how we're seeing the economy kind of open up and folks get out more and we're seeing that come back nicely in our DGX stores.\n And so you're right. We're very excited. You'll recall last conference call, we talked about the opportunity for 1,000 possible DGX locations across the country. And then you know us well. If we find a concept that can work even better and increase that over time, we'll certainly try to do that. But right now, the offering inside the DGX, we also have very high customer satisfaction scores like the pOpshelf brand as well. We are real pleased with what the customer is saying and we're also pleased with the opportunity. So stay tuned, but that just gives us yet another leg of growth.\n So you got pOpshelf where we've talked about incremental 3,000 opportunities; DGX, an incremental 1,000 opportunities; and then our traditional fleet where we believe there's 13,000 additional opportunities. So 17,000 opportunities in total gives us great confidence that we can continue to grow this great brand across the country. So we're really excited about what the future holds there."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Dollar General's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, March 16, 2023. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference. \nKevin Walker: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Jeff Owen, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

[Operator Instructions] Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their dedication to serving our customers and communities this year. I am inspired by this team's commitment to our mission of serving others and the passion they have for helping our customers save time and money every day. \n Our fourth quarter performance was led by strong comp sales growth of 5.7%. And while this result was below our expectations, our performance included market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and contributed to a net sales increase of 17.9% to $10.2 billion. \n Our Q4 comp sales were driven by an increase in average basket size, primarily attributable to inflation and partially offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic, primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic in late December. And similar to recent quarters, average units per basket were down. Notably, both November and January comp sales at 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, were within our expected range of 6% to 7% for the quarter. However, our December sales performance was negatively impacted by winter storm Elliott, which had the most significant effect on our stores in the final days leading up to Christmas. The quarter was also impacted by greater-than-anticipated inventory damages, which contributed to diluted EPS results that were below our expectations. \n While the storm had some damages impact, we also incurred higher damages than expected as we work through the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related store and distribution inefficiencies we experienced during the second half of the year. Although we expect some of these related impacts to be with us through the end of Q1, we are pleased to have the storage capacity constraints largely behind us, which we believe positions us well moving forward. \n Turning to a few highlights of the 2022 fiscal year. Net sales increased 10.6% to $37.8 billion and included a benefit of approximately 2 percentage points or $678 million in sales from the 53rd week. Comp sales for the year increased 4.3%, driven by strong growth in basket size. Although a significant portion of the basket growth was attributable to inflation, we were pleased to see an average basket size at the end of the year of more than five items and nearly $17. \n The team accomplished a great deal in 2022, and we closed the year with significant progress on our strategic initiatives and operating priorities while achieving several key milestones in Q4 and the weeks thereafter. \n We were particularly excited to celebrate the opening of our 19,000 store in Joplin, Missouri in January, as we continue to support our customers with our unique combination of value and convenience in their hometown communities. We also completed the initial rollout of our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI with the offering now in nearly all of our stores across the chain. \n Finally, we made strong progress in our supply chain, reducing our storage capacity constraints and improving operations during the quarter. More specifically, and as we said we would do, we added significant capacity in Q4, bringing nearly 3 million square feet of distribution capacity online. These efforts culminated with the opening of our newest distribution center in Blair, Nebraska during the quarter. \n I also want to highlight that we have started 2023 with the opening of our first store in Mexico. And while the store has only been open a few short weeks, we are very encouraged by the early response from our new customers. These achievements are a testament to this team's hard work and continued focus on execution and innovation as we continue to deliver on our mission of serving others. \n Turning now to an update on our customers. In addition to adjusting the mix of their baskets, we continue to see customers shift spending to more affordable options, including our private brands, which represent more than 20% of our total sales. Within consumables, private brand growth, both in absolute dollars and penetration was the highest in the fourth quarter. We also increased our share of wallet and share of trips across all segments of our core customer in Q4, and we believe we will be increasingly important to them in the year ahead. \n With regard to trade-in behavior, customers and income brackets above our core customers are shopping with us at an increasing rate, underscoring our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers. \n We remain focused on our goal to be priced at relative parity with mass merchants and we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and all classes of trade. Furthermore, given the strong demand from customers, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point. Notably, during Q4, our comp sales were over 30% in our Value Valley set, which is comprised entirely of items at the $1 price point. \n Overall, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of this program and the value it offers to our customers. In addition, we believe we are well positioned to continue serving both new and existing customers, and we are moving with great intentionality to build on our momentum. \n To this end, we are excited about our plans for 2023. Building on the investments we made in 2022, we plan to make a larger targeted incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores this year. This investment will primarily consist of incremental labor hours to support our expectations regarding consistent store standards while further enhancing the associate and customer experience. \n In turn, we believe this investment will position us to drive greater on-shelf availability and capture additional market share while amplifying the potential of our initiatives and ensuring our readiness for our growing customer base. \n And with the progress we have made in the supply chain, the prior investments we have made in wages, and the growing customer engagement we are seeing, we believe we are well positioned to see a meaningful return on this investment. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our innovation will continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n In summary, we are excited about our plans to deliver strong growth in 2023 while also making significant and deliberate investments in the business. We believe our customer and communities will need us even more as we move throughout 2023. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we are well positioned to serve them while also creating long-term value for our shareholders. \n With that, I will turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n As Jeff already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a decrease of 35 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increased LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, and increases in inventory shrink, damages and markdowns, partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in transportation costs. Of note, product cost inflation continued as a significant headwind, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $164 million during the quarter and approximately $517 million for the full year. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.7%, a decrease of 29 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail occupancy costs, incentive compensation and retail labor. These were partially offset by certain expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales in the current year period primarily utilities. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 17.1% to $933 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.1%, a decrease of 6 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to decreased income tax benefits associated with the stock-based compensation compared to 2021. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $2.96. For the full year, EPS increased 5% to $10.68 and included an estimated positive impact of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $6.8 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 20.4% overall and 14.3% on a per store basis. This increase continues to reflect the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of NCI as well as the earlier receipt of seasonal goods. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace is moderating as we expected. Notably, our Q4 inventory growth rate per store was essentially half of what it was in Q3. Looking ahead, we anticipate more normalized growth rates as we move through 2023. \n Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. In 2022, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $2 billion, a decrease of 31%, which was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels. Total capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution, transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $121 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. \n We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. \n Moving to our financial outlook for the fiscal 2023 year. We anticipate the challenging economic and operating environment to continue into 2023, but we believe we are well positioned to drive strong growth as we move throughout the year. For 2023, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on February 23, 2023, and providing additional financial guidance to include the following expectations. \n Net sales growth in the range of approximately 5.5% to 6%, including an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week; same-store sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%; and EPS growth in the range of approximately 4% to 6%, including estimated negative impacts of approximately 3 percentage points due to higher interest expense and approximately 4 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week. \n Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, which includes the impact of significant inflation in the cost of certain building materials, construction of new distribution centers and continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. \n With regard to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved an increased quarterly dividend payment of $0.59 per share. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $500 million of our common stock this year. This is a lower amount as compared to the recent years but consistent with our capital allocation priorities and reflects our commitment to our current credit rating, our continued strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half compared to the first half. This is due in part to our expectation of continued headwinds from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through the first half of the year. We anticipate certain of these headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1, including an estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense of approximately $40 million, inventory damages and residual impacts of the storage capacity constraints and related inefficiencies that Jeff mentioned earlier. \n In addition, we expect the year-over-year net impact of the labor investment to be most significant in Q1 as we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2, and we believe the benefits of the incremental labor will become more significant later in the year. As we move into the back half, we also anticipate a benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022. \n Turning now to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of 2022, we expect significant benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates, expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. \n We also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. Furthermore, we anticipate a significant contribution from our DG Media Network, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a moment. Partially offsetting some of these expected benefits are the anticipated sales mix pressure and increased inventory shrink and damages I mentioned as well as increased markdowns as we return to rates more in line with the historic norms. \n With regard to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2023, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. And as Jeff noted, we plan to make an incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. While this investment will pressure SG&A in 2023, we believe it is the right thing for the business and will drive stronger in-store execution, positioning us well to build on the momentum we have with our customers. \n We expect a headwind from inflationary pressures in our business. So we continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. \n In closing, we are grateful for the team's hard work to deliver for our customers in 2022. Looking ahead, we are excited about our growth plans for 2023, including strong sales and operating profit while simultaneously making significant and deliberate investments in the business. \n As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take a few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, which have transformed this company in recent years, resulting in strong growth and enhanced profitability.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Starting with NCI. With the initial rollout phase now complete, we will focus on continuing to refine the assortment and enhance the treasure hunt offering to provide value to our customers in the nonconsumable categories. Overall, we are very pleased with the success of NCI including market share gains in nonconsumable sales in Q4. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 37 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 140 at the end of 2022, located within 14 states. \n While sales in this economic environment have been somewhat softer than our earlier results, we continue to be pleased with the customer response. Looking ahead, we plan to more than double the pOpshelf shell store count in 2023, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to nearly 300 by year-end, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. We are now delivering perishable products to more than 19,000 stores from 12 facilities, and we continue to be pleased with the cost savings from this initiative and importantly, the significantly enhanced profitability of our perishables offering. \n In addition to capturing cost savings, DG Fresh also aims to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during 2022. \n Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of 2022, we offered fresh produce in more than 3,200 stores with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023. \n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2022, we added more than 66,000 cooler doors across our store base. And we plan to install a similar number of cooler doors in 2023. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made and savings we realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. As a reminder, the initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 4,400 stores at the end of 2022, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 5,500 stores by the end of 2023. \n Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and testing of our mobile clinic with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately, services over time, particularly in rural America. \n Finally, we also plan to make significant enhancements to our private brand offering in 2023 as we know how important these value offerings are for our customers. We are increasing private brand offerings across many important categories, including candy and snacks, perishables, pet food and over-the-counter health care products. We believe these products will further differentiate Dollar General in the marketplace as we look to provide our customers with tremendous value on quality products. \n In addition to the initiatives I just discussed, as well as the anticipated supply chain efficiencies I mentioned earlier, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in global sourcing as well as shrink and damage reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2022, we completed a total of 2,961 real estate projects, including 1,039 new stores, 1,795 remodels and 127 relocations. \n For 2023, our goal remains to execute approximately 3,170 real estate projects in the United States across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 store relocations. Notably, this would be the most real estate projects we have executed in 1 year. \n Our ability to innovate on the store formats continues to be an important strength for the business, and we expect to leverage multiple formats to drive strong returns in the year ahead. Approximately 80% of our new stores in nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store. \n With regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce in many stores. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are excited about our international expansion. We were pleased to open our first Mi Super Dollar General in Monterrey, Mexico last month, and we have been very encouraged by the customer response and community reception we have seen so far. \n Looking ahead, our goal is to have approximately 20 stores serving underserved communities in Northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. \n Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2022 with approximately 4.5 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to continue to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to serve us as an important extension of the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. DoorDash is available in nearly 14,000 stores, and we anticipate extending this offering to an additional 1,000 stores in 2023. We are pleased with the incremental sales growth attributed to this partnership as well as its profitability, and we believe we have an opportunity to drive even stronger growth moving forward. \n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique customer profiles, especially rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country. We expect our DG Media Network to grow significantly in 2023 as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while substantially increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach. The first phase of this initiative, which included rolltainer optimization and self-checkout is focused on enhancing customer convenience and labor productivity in our stores. Self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, was available in more than 11,000 stores at the end of 2022, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. \n Looking ahead, our goal is to have a self-checkout offering in more than 13,000 stores by the end of 2023, including the full self-checkout option in more than 2,000 stores as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consist of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams while laying the foundation for additional phases of Fast Track in the future. \n We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private tractor fleet, which is one of the largest private retail fleets in the U.S. Our fleet consisted of more than 1,600 tractors at the end of 2022 and accounted for more than 40% of our outbound transportation needs. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023, which would account for more than 50% of our outbound transportation fleet. \n Overall, our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created more than 10,000 new jobs in 2022, while continuing to drive opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team, which nearly doubled in size in 2022, began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. \n We continue to have great success hiring the talent we need, and we are pleased with our staffing levels and applicant flow. Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is what sets Dollar General apart from the competition and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n We added incredible individuals across the organization in 2022 as we grew teams in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center, while also adding a local team in Mexico to support our new customers in those communities. \n In addition to new opportunities, we have made significant investments in our people, including raising average hourly retail wages by approximately 23% over the last 3 years and investing over 4 million training hours in 2022 to promote education and development. The people of Dollar General are our greatest strength and the driving force of this company. \n In closing, we made great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2022, while making a difference in the lives of our customers. As we enter 2023, we are excited about our robust plans for growth, which we believe will further enhance our ability to serve our customers in meaningful ways. We are the innovation leader in our space, and we are laser-focused on executing at a high level to continue driving long-term sustainable growth while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. \n Finally, I want to thank more than 170,000 employees for their commitment to serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in 2023. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Sorry about the noise. Open-ended question for you. So the business has executed well over a long period of time. Last couple of quarters, we've had some missteps or things that haven't gone to plan. Not all of that I think is clear to us for the Street. And yet all these growth initiatives are still happening at the same time. So the open-ended question is have you debated or is the debate the balance of sort of the growth against investments that's focusing on the core? \nJeffery Owen: Well, Simeon, thank you for the question. I first want to say, certainly, the last 2 quarters have been challenging. And I can tell you, we're disappointed in our results. This team takes great pride in delivering on our commitments and we've been doing that for the almost 30 years I've been here. And that is something that is not changing. And I can tell you, we have a tremendously deep and outstanding team that's laser focused on executing and innovating over the long term.\n And certainly, we have faced some challenges. But what we do here at Dollar General is we control what we can control, and that has allowed us to emerge even stronger as we move forward. So as I think about our balance between execution and innovation, one of the things I think it's important to remember is we have a long track record of execution, and this team will continue to deliver on that. \n And on the innovation front, we don't do things on the side of our desks. And so as we do innovate, one of the things that our team does more than anything is, as you know, capital is not an issue for us. It's all about organizational capacity. And I think the team has done an excellent job of making sure that we've dedicated the resources, the focus and the time to be able to grow this foundation. And it certainly served us very well. \n If you think about these challenging times we're in right now, this company is in a much different place. And as our customer has gravitated towards more consumables, the investments we've made in our strategic initiatives have allowed us to serve her even better and more profitably. \n And so as we look forward, we're excited about some of the investments we announced today, which will be on top of the strategic investments we've made previously, which has put us in a very, very enviable position of having a rock-solid foundation strategically and a laser-focused on execution. And this team is committed to delivering that as we look forward into '23 and beyond. \nSimeon Gutman: And the one follow-up to that is the $100 million in wages, I don't think it's a big surprise, but it was maybe in man hours and not rate. So can you talk about that trade-off or the balance between those two and where, I guess, you feel comfortable where you are on rates? \nJeffery Owen: Yes. We absolutely do, Simeon, and that's one of the -- that's a great distinction. Here, at Dollar General, for the 85 years we've been around, the store has always been the company. And our ability to serve local communities is something that we do better than anybody and we take great pride in that. \n And so when you think about the investment that we're very excited about, the reason why it's in hours rather than wages is because we've been paying competitive wages for many years. And you heard in my prepared comments that our wages have increased 23% over the last 3 years. So our ability to attract and retain talent remains one of our core competencies. \n And so I'm -- the other thing you got to remember is where our stores are located. They're located in rural communities. 75% are in communities at 20,000 or less. And we prevent -- we provide career growth opportunities that are unmatched in retail, which leads to our staffing levels being very robust, which we mentioned. And that gives us the opportunity because we're in such a good position to invest in the hours. \n And so as we think about hours, we're pleased at what we believe this will do to elevate our store standards and our consistency, which we believe the customer will benefit and the associate will benefit. \n And so as you -- as we move throughout '23, when you combine the improvements we're making in our supply chain, which really gives us the timing to do this, and you combine that with the in-stock improvements, our customers will begin to see our standards improve, our on-shelf availability will improve, and we'll be ready to serve that growing customer base that we're really pleased that we're seeing. \n And so that's what gives us the confidence in this. We feel this is the right level of investment. And the reason we feel that way is because we've been testing and learning this in 2022. You know Dollar General very well. We don't do things just on a whim. We test and learn. We've been doing that in '22. We liked what we saw. And we wanted to make sure our supply chain was in a position where we could take advantage of the ability to elevate the experience for the customer while we flow goods freely to the stores. \n And right now, we're in a good position to do that as we enter '23, and we're excited about what this is going to do for the customer and ultimately, the return we're going to see over time. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Jeff, could you speak to recent behavior that you're seeing from the low-income consumer? Or maybe any changes in the ranking of their priorities from those customer surveys that I know you run regularly? \n And John, help us to think about the cadence of comps as we think about the year? Or just any color on the first quarter same-store sales? Or any comments on business to date just relative to that 3% to 3.5% full year forecast? \nJeffery Owen: Well, thanks, Matt. I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to John. As you think about the customer, one of the good things about Dollar General is we're an all-weather brand. And we've shown over the last 3 decades how we can serve that customer in any economic environment. \n But what we're seeing right now with our customer is the best news we have is that she's still employed. And as we've talked about for many years, that is the single most important factor to her economic health. But we are certainly, as we talk to our customers, and as you know, Matt, we do this very, very frequently, and our digital capabilities allow us to do it in many different ways, which we're pleased, we're seeing that she's worse off financially. \n And it's primarily due to food inflation. And obviously, as you think about how that changes her behaviors, one of the things we're seeing is she's relying more on savings, credit cards, and also borrowing money, quite frankly, from friends. And as that shows up in the store, what we're seeing in the shopping behavior is that translates into our customer coming more often, she's buying fewer items on occasion. \n And I got to tell you, one of the things we're very, very pleased with is the fact that we are still leaning hard into our dollar price point. And we're there for that customer. And as you saw in our prepared comments, that is resonating extremely well with her, as you saw from the comp sales we're seeing in that category. But also, we're seeing her lean into private brands, and we're seeing her shift her purchases more to consumables. \n But as you know, our core customer, she's the smartest customer, I believe, in retail, and she figures this out over time. And our box is more relevant than ever as a result of the investments we've made over the last several years. And that allows us to go where the customer wants us to go and do it more profitably. And that's a very enviable position for us, and I think our market share gains kind of show that. \n But that's kind of what we're seeing from the customer standpoint. And certainly, there's some near-term challenges that have just recently emerged. I'll let John talk about that in Q1. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. So in terms of the customer, as Jeff said, we're continuing to see an increasingly economically strained customer, and we're seeing shopping behaviors indicative of this environment.\n The two recent events we're monitoring is the termination of SNAP benefits, the emergency waivers in the remaining states, coupled with lower tax refunds in recent weeks. It's possible this could further pressure the low-income customers somewhat in the near term remains to be seen. We didn't see an impact last year. Some rolled off, but the customer is in a different place now. \n So we'll carefully monitor that, but we continue to believe that the customer needs us even more in tough environments as history has shown, and our full year guidance is reflective of all we know today. \n In terms of the shape of the year, I'll kind of talk to first half, second half and then Q1, both in terms of sales as well as earnings. As you look at the shape of the year, as we indicated, it's really a back half story for EPS growth. Now we're expecting sales comp to be relatively even between the first half and the second half, slightly higher in the second half. But then we expect continued headwinds, as we mentioned, from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through Q1 or rather the first half. \n And then in the second half, we anticipate a pretty sizable benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022 as well as the benefit of the initiatives that we're driving. \n Now as you look at Q1, we mentioned that we anticipate certain headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1. That includes the estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense, which we quantified as $40 million as well as inventory damages and then the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related supply chain efficiencies -- inefficiencies we've mentioned. \n And then the other piece is with regard to the labor investment. We expect the year-over-year net impact -- pressure from that to be most significant in Q1. And that's because we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2 and believe the benefits of the incremental labor will be more significant later in the year. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe just a follow-up, John, on the balance sheet. Could you just update us on free cash priorities? What is the multiyear debt leverage target? How best to think about CapEx as a percent of sales moving forward? And just share repurchase as a use of cash going forward? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. I'll start by saying that our capital allocation priorities have not changed. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you have high return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and our strategic initiatives, that's where we focus our capital. \n Then our second priority is then returning the excess cash to shareholders based on the excess cash and debt capacity, paying a competitive dividend as we increased this quarter, and then by buying back shares with the remaining excess cash and debt capacity. But we remain focused on protecting our current investment-grade credit rating by keeping our adjusted debt to EBITDA around 3. \n In terms of CapEx, that is up a bit this year. We guided to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Really includes the impact of pretty significant inflation, particularly when you think of steel. As we accelerate the unit growth story here, the remodels as well as build, we're working on three distribution centers here, which is going to help our capacity. So it takes some capital to do that, but we see great returns in these. \n And as you look at the stores, not only are we doing more stores, we're doing bigger stores. And we love what we see with these bigger stores with more sales, more profit per store. So a little more CapEx but really like the return from these. So I think that's the way to think about our capital allocation priorities and the drivers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: You had commented just on one of the last questions around tax refunds and SNAP as potential headwinds. I was hoping you could also address the social security cost of living increase that kicked in at the beginning of the year. Has that been any tailwind to your business that you've noted so far? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I'll elaborate on SNAP a little bit, and then I can talk about tax refunds and then talk about COLA. In terms of SNAP, it's interesting. You had an increase -- a pretty good increase in the tender over the last few years since the pandemic, as states enacted the emergency allotment benefits. Over the last couple of years, we've seen about 18 states roll off -- some of our key states. And what we saw is with the elimination of this, we saw an offset in other tender methods. And we didn't see an overall impact to our sales. \n What we are monitoring though, is that, coupled with the tax refunds, which are lower in general, they're a little bit ahead in terms of the number of returns filed. But per return, what we're seeing so far and everybody is seeing, is a lower return overall in terms of the dollars. And so we're monitoring the two. Too early to call, but monitoring if those two and where the customer is at right now has a different impact remains to be seen. \n In terms of COLA, we did see some bump from COLA, particularly those consumers and those stores that over-index with that consumer that receives benefits based on COLA. However, I would say, while a benefit, we saw some bump, not a significant impact. \nPeter Keith: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you a little bit about the LIFO impact. So $517 million in the full year is pretty meaningful headwind that you've experienced. I guess if the Fed's going to achieve their mission and moderate inflation here over the next year or 2, you should probably have less of a LIFO charge. Do you have any LIFO benefit or lower charge here factored in for 2023 at this point? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. The way to think about this is very significant LIFO charge last year. We don't expect a deflationary environment this year, so we do expect a LIFO charge. But we are assuming a more moderate LIFO charge. So less of a headwind this year. \n I think one thing to just bear in mind as you think about the year-over-year, we did mitigate where we could, the LIFO charge by taking targeted pricing actions as we saw the market move. So that mitigated the impact of that. So I wouldn't consider this fully a tailwind, but certainly less of a headwind as we go into this year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: First, can you just clarify, John, like are you expecting earnings to actually be down in the first half or just lower? \n And then my main question is, we've seen a pretty significant decrease in payables to inventory over the last couple of quarters. This quarter, for example, inventory was actually up over $1 billion, payables were actually down year-over-year. Can you just provide any more color on what's happening there? And do you expect that to ramp up to -- kind of the payables inventory to ramp up to historical levels? Or is there some sort of structural change, whether it's mix or capacity changes, et cetera, that is influencing that? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. So in terms of the cadence for the year, what we said is it really is a back-half story. You really are going to see the growth in the back half of the year. We're not anticipating a sizable drop in the first half. We're looking at it to be modestly up to flattish. But -- so then it's really a back-half story in terms of the earnings. \n In terms of the AP to inventory, what we have seen is the driver of that is really higher inventory levels, coupled with the timing of payments. As you look at the timing of payments, one of the things, for instance, that impacts with the 53rd week, it then pulls in the week 1 rent payment. \n So as we look further, we expect inventory levels to normalize. As you look at -- in Q4, we saw our inventory per store dropped in half. It went -- it was 14% on a per store basis, which was about half the growth rate we saw in the previous period -- or previous quarter. And again, it reflects the same drivers that's really the product cost inflation and a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in NCI as we completed the rollout of that. \n Important thing to note here is it is seasonal goods -- or it's early receipt of seasonal goods or was there other driver. But it's important to note that these are evergreen-type products, which aren't time-sensitive. So we feel really good about the quality of the inventory, the ability to move through that and expect this to continue to normalize as we move through the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I also wanted to ask on CapEx. So historically, CapEx has been about 3% of sales. And last year and this year, it's about 4%. So just want to get a sense of where you think the normal level of spending could be in a normalized environment as a percent of sales or any other commentary? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. Again, getting back to the capital, a big driver of that was the inflation as well as the stepped up real estate and the number of projects we're doing in terms of DCs, working on three DCs in one quarter. So again, feel great about the returns of these. \n I don't want to speculate on -- and give future guidance on CapEx. Could see an environment where with the inflation coming down, it would moderate that. But more to come in terms of the CapEx, but what we are really focused on is the returns of these and feel great about the returns and we'll see what's required to grow the business going forward, but more to come. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So DG Media, the commentary is very positive there in terms of what you're seeing with your vendors. As you think about the dollars there, how do you think about reinvesting the business versus flowing that through the bottom line? \nJeffery Owen: Rupesh, you're right. We are very excited about what we're seeing on our DG Media Network. And quite frankly, our digital acceleration in general. One of the things that we've learned over the last couple of years when we started this journey was how digitally savvy our customer is and how much it helps her to be more connected and more loyal to Dollar General and it shows up in her ability to spend with us. \n Certainly, as you think about the network and you think about what we're able to bring to the market, we're able to bring access to a segment of the population that's really difficult to connect with. And when you think about the rural population, 30% of the United States population, that's meaningful. And that's why our brand partners and our CPG partners are very excited to partner with DG, and we're excited about where the media network will go over time. \n In terms of kind of how we handle the dollars that we're receiving from that, obviously, one of the things that's great about this company is our ability to grow our operating profit and reinvest in the business. And this is one of the ways it allows us to do that. And so that's why we're all very excited about the strategic foundation we've built here, the muscle we've built. And we're excited about some of the initiatives that we're going to bring to the forefront as we look forward, especially in '23 and beyond. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short with Credit Suisse. \nKaren Short: And John, sad to see you go. It's been great working with you. I just wanted to go back to the overall algorithm for DG. Obviously, there's noise in '23, and we all appreciate that. But can you just maybe give a little bit of an update on what you think the long-term algorithm should be as we get beyond '23? \n And then I wanted to just clarify on the wage investment and/or wage. Can you just let us know what your average hourly wage rate is? And how you think about that as opposed to investing more in dollars, and I realize you need to invest in hours, but dollars? \nJeffery Owen: Yes, it's Karen. I'll take the first part of that question, and then John, I'll kick it to you for the algorithm question. But Karen, we don't disclose our average hourly rate. But what I can tell you is, as I said earlier, is we have and we continue to pay very competitive wages. And I think the one nuance to Dollar General that I frankly believe is underappreciated is the ability to come into this company as a part-time sales associate and grow into a career. .\n And you can do it faster than you can in any other retailer because we're committed to internal development, and we have the opportunity to provide you with growth opportunities because of our dynamic growth.\n So I think those two things are the reason why we feel great about our staffing levels, our ability to attract and our ability to retain our talent. And so that's why we're investing in hours. And right now, we're very pleased to see that wage grow 23% over the last 3 years. So we're in a great position, and that's why we're able to put this investment more towards the hours in the store rather than having to catch up on wages. And John? \nJohn Garratt: As you think of the algorithm and if you just step back and look over the last 3 years, while it's been up and down over the last 3 years in this environment, every element of that well in excess of the algorithm. If you look at sales comp, well in excess of the algorithm; expansion of gross margin and operating margin; operating income, EPS, well in excess of the algorithm. So we feel very good about the performance over this period of time, and we feel the model remains very strong and very resilient. \n We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term, not every year. Some years, we see it prudent to invest to protect that growth over the long term. But if you look at the business model and fundamentals, they're very strong with the unique combination of value and convenience resonating as strong as ever. We continue to see very compelling store-level economics in new store returns and then significant bumps from the remodels. And we continue to see 16,000-plus new store opportunities for everybody in our space. But obviously, we've been getting an outsized share of that. So significant runway for growth. \n The initiatives are performing very well, helping both the top line and bottom line. They're focused on both. And we see, as I mentioned, a lot of levers within gross margin to continue to expand that over the long term. And the business generates a lot of cash to then buy back shares and reinvest in the business. So we think top to bottom, the business model and fundamentals remain very strong. \nKaren Short: So is it fair to say or reasonable to think that, that's more of a '24 return? I mean I know you haven't given guidance, but just some... \nJohn Garratt: I don't want to give specific guidance, but I would just say we feel very good about the future and the strength of the business. \nOperator: Our final question is Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: And congrats, John, on your retirement announcement. It's been a pleasure to work with you. My first question for Jeff on market share. You talked in your prepared remarks about seeing customers trade in the Dollar General. You talked about higher income consumers trading down to Dollar General. So I think it's clear that Dollar General is gaining share across income cohorts and categories, and you talked about Value Valley as well, comping up over, I think it was 30%. So maybe could you talk a little bit more about where you think this market share is coming from? And where you see it likely to come from even more so as we look ahead? \nJeffery Owen: Well, Corey, first of all, we are very pleased at the market share gains that we've been able to achieve, both on the consumable and on the nonconsumable segments of our business. And when you think about our customers as well, we're also incredibly pleased with the fact that we were able to increase our productivity with really all segments of our core customer.\n We increased our share of wallet, our share of trips. Those are all really encouraging signs and very pleased to see that. It's a credit to our team and their ability to connect with this customer, bring an assortment that she's looking for and delivered in a consistent fashion. \n As you think about the donors, it's really the same donors we've had for quite some time, primarily drug is our biggest share donor. And so as we look forward to continuing to refine our assortment, our strategic initiatives, really allow us to really bring even more, we believe, relevant assortment to our customer. We think we're in the early to mid-innings on many of these initiatives when you think about our treasure hunt with NCI, when you think about DG Fresh and the relevance of the perishable and frozen offering, you think about produce. \n And we're very pleased on our digital strategy that's allowing us to, quite frankly, through our first-party data, our ability to understand this customer on an even greater level than we ever have before, we'll be able to continue to bring the relevance she's looking for. And when you think about our growing store base, we continue to see our share opportunity very, very optimistically, and we would expect us to continue to take it from the same donors we've seen in previous. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. And then just a follow-up for John. So it sounds like there's a couple of moving parts in terms of the gross margin, specifically as you look out over this year, and I recognize it's a first half, second half story, but could you maybe stack rank the drivers that you anticipate from maybe most important to least important, to be affecting the gross margin line this year? I recognize mix shift is also a fairly prevailing factor in this. So how does that also factor into how you're thinking about the consumables mix shift as we look ahead for the next 12 months? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. As you think of the headwinds and the tailwinds, I'll start with the headwinds, but then go to what we see as a pretty sizable tailwind -- tailwinds. The ones we talked about were one, sales mix, that pressure continuing. So we've assumed that. We've also assumed shrink and damages as we move through the first half, in particular. And then increased markdowns, and that's really just getting back to rates more in line with historical norms. \n I wouldn't say of these one really stands out significantly over the others, but they all contribute as headwinds. And then, again, the shrink and damages more of a first half pressure than back half as we see it now. Damages, in particular, Q1 pressure as you look at the cadence of the year. \n We mentioned the LIFO impact, and we do think that will provide some benefit, but I wouldn't flow the whole thing through because you had the pricing that went with that last year. \n But then as you think of the tailwinds, the biggest one I would point to and the biggest overall driver I would point to here is the supply chain. We expect a pretty material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of last year as well as the sizable benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates as well as the benefit of expanding our private tractor fleet, which we're growing from 1,600 tractors at the end of last year to over 2,000 by the end of next year. \n And again, as we make those conversions, it's about a 20% savings in addition to other benefits that we expect as we optimize DG Fresh, NCI, and then expect a pretty sizable benefit from DG Media Network to name a few. And then obviously, we intend to leverage our scale as we have as a limited SKU operator, and that's another lever amongst the other levers we've mentioned in the past. \n So again, as you look at the guide for the year, we gave the top line, the bottom line, we didn't give gross margin, but I think it implies a pretty healthy operating profit growth than rates overall despite pretty sizable investment in the business. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeff Owen for closing comments. \nJeffery Owen: I'd like to thank you all for your questions and your interest in Dollar General. And while our operating environment is dynamic for our customer and business, we are staying focused on the things that we can control, which is continued innovation and execution in our business. \n If I could summarize our discussion today, I'd like to leave you with these three things. First, we have a powerful growth strategy. Second, we are investing in the future. And third, we are doing this while also planning to deliver strong results in 2023. \n We're excited about this business, and I am confident we are well positioned to serve our customers and also create value for our shareholders in the year ahead. Thank you for your listening today, and I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n As Jeff already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a decrease of 35 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increased LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, and increases in inventory shrink, damages and markdowns, partially offset by higher inventory markups and a reduction in transportation costs. Of note, product cost inflation continued as a significant headwind, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $164 million during the quarter and approximately $517 million for the full year. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.7%, a decrease of 29 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail occupancy costs, incentive compensation and retail labor. These were partially offset by certain expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales in the current year period primarily utilities. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 17.1% to $933 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.1%, a decrease of 6 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to decreased income tax benefits associated with the stock-based compensation compared to 2021. Finally, EPS for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $2.96. For the full year, EPS increased 5% to $10.68 and included an estimated positive impact of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. \n Merchandise inventories were $6.8 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 20.4% overall and 14.3% on a per store basis. This increase continues to reflect the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of NCI as well as the earlier receipt of seasonal goods. While inventory growth is still elevated, the pace is moderating as we expected. Notably, our Q4 inventory growth rate per store was essentially half of what it was in Q3. Looking ahead, we anticipate more normalized growth rates as we move through 2023. \n Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. In 2022, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $2 billion, a decrease of 31%, which was primarily attributable to higher inventory levels. Total capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution, transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $121 million. At the end of the year, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. \n We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. \n Moving to our financial outlook for the fiscal 2023 year. We anticipate the challenging economic and operating environment to continue into 2023, but we believe we are well positioned to drive strong growth as we move throughout the year. For 2023, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on February 23, 2023, and providing additional financial guidance to include the following expectations. \n Net sales growth in the range of approximately 5.5% to 6%, including an anticipated negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week; same-store sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%; and EPS growth in the range of approximately 4% to 6%, including estimated negative impacts of approximately 3 percentage points due to higher interest expense and approximately 4 percentage points due to lapping the 2022 53rd week. \n Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 22.5% to 23%. We also expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, which includes the impact of significant inflation in the cost of certain building materials, construction of new distribution centers and continued investment in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. \n With regard to shareholder returns, our Board of Directors recently approved an increased quarterly dividend payment of $0.59 per share. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $500 million of our common stock this year. This is a lower amount as compared to the recent years but consistent with our capital allocation priorities and reflects our commitment to our current credit rating, our continued strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for our business. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect EPS growth to be much stronger in the second half compared to the first half. This is due in part to our expectation of continued headwinds from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through the first half of the year. We anticipate certain of these headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1, including an estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense of approximately $40 million, inventory damages and residual impacts of the storage capacity constraints and related inefficiencies that Jeff mentioned earlier. \n In addition, we expect the year-over-year net impact of the labor investment to be most significant in Q1 as we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2, and we believe the benefits of the incremental labor will become more significant later in the year. As we move into the back half, we also anticipate a benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022. \n Turning now to gross margin for 2023. In addition to the material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of 2022, we expect significant benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates, expansion of our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. \n We also expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI. Furthermore, we anticipate a significant contribution from our DG Media Network, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a moment. Partially offsetting some of these expected benefits are the anticipated sales mix pressure and increased inventory shrink and damages I mentioned as well as increased markdowns as we return to rates more in line with the historic norms. \n With regard to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2023, as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. And as Jeff noted, we plan to make an incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores, primarily through additional labor hours. While this investment will pressure SG&A in 2023, we believe it is the right thing for the business and will drive stronger in-store execution, positioning us well to build on the momentum we have with our customers. \n We expect a headwind from inflationary pressures in our business. So we continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track. \n In closing, we are grateful for the team's hard work to deliver for our customers in 2022. Looking ahead, we are excited about our growth plans for 2023, including strong sales and operating profit while simultaneously making significant and deliberate investments in the business. \n As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Yes. So in terms of the customer, as Jeff said, we're continuing to see an increasingly economically strained customer, and we're seeing shopping behaviors indicative of this environment.\n The two recent events we're monitoring is the termination of SNAP benefits, the emergency waivers in the remaining states, coupled with lower tax refunds in recent weeks. It's possible this could further pressure the low-income customers somewhat in the near term remains to be seen. We didn't see an impact last year. Some rolled off, but the customer is in a different place now. \n So we'll carefully monitor that, but we continue to believe that the customer needs us even more in tough environments as history has shown, and our full year guidance is reflective of all we know today. \n In terms of the shape of the year, I'll kind of talk to first half, second half and then Q1, both in terms of sales as well as earnings. As you look at the shape of the year, as we indicated, it's really a back half story for EPS growth. Now we're expecting sales comp to be relatively even between the first half and the second half, slightly higher in the second half. But then we expect continued headwinds, as we mentioned, from sales mix pressure, higher interest expense and increased shrink and damages as we move through Q1 or rather the first half. \n And then in the second half, we anticipate a pretty sizable benefit from lapping the significant supply chain costs and winter storm impacts from the second half of 2022 as well as the benefit of the initiatives that we're driving. \n Now as you look at Q1, we mentioned that we anticipate certain headwinds to be most pronounced in Q1. That includes the estimated year-over-year increase in interest expense, which we quantified as $40 million as well as inventory damages and then the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related supply chain efficiencies -- inefficiencies we've mentioned. \n And then the other piece is with regard to the labor investment. We expect the year-over-year net impact -- pressure from that to be most significant in Q1. And that's because we don't begin lapping last year's smaller investments until Q2 and believe the benefits of the incremental labor will be more significant later in the year. Sure. I'll start by saying that our capital allocation priorities have not changed. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you have high return growth opportunities like new store growth, remodels and our strategic initiatives, that's where we focus our capital. \n Then our second priority is then returning the excess cash to shareholders based on the excess cash and debt capacity, paying a competitive dividend as we increased this quarter, and then by buying back shares with the remaining excess cash and debt capacity. But we remain focused on protecting our current investment-grade credit rating by keeping our adjusted debt to EBITDA around 3. \n In terms of CapEx, that is up a bit this year. We guided to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Really includes the impact of pretty significant inflation, particularly when you think of steel. As we accelerate the unit growth story here, the remodels as well as build, we're working on three distribution centers here, which is going to help our capacity. So it takes some capital to do that, but we see great returns in these. \n And as you look at the stores, not only are we doing more stores, we're doing bigger stores. And we love what we see with these bigger stores with more sales, more profit per store. So a little more CapEx but really like the return from these. So I think that's the way to think about our capital allocation priorities and the drivers. Yes. I'll elaborate on SNAP a little bit, and then I can talk about tax refunds and then talk about COLA. In terms of SNAP, it's interesting. You had an increase -- a pretty good increase in the tender over the last few years since the pandemic, as states enacted the emergency allotment benefits. Over the last couple of years, we've seen about 18 states roll off -- some of our key states. And what we saw is with the elimination of this, we saw an offset in other tender methods. And we didn't see an overall impact to our sales. \n What we are monitoring though, is that, coupled with the tax refunds, which are lower in general, they're a little bit ahead in terms of the number of returns filed. But per return, what we're seeing so far and everybody is seeing, is a lower return overall in terms of the dollars. And so we're monitoring the two. Too early to call, but monitoring if those two and where the customer is at right now has a different impact remains to be seen. \n In terms of COLA, we did see some bump from COLA, particularly those consumers and those stores that over-index with that consumer that receives benefits based on COLA. However, I would say, while a benefit, we saw some bump, not a significant impact. Yes. The way to think about this is very significant LIFO charge last year. We don't expect a deflationary environment this year, so we do expect a LIFO charge. But we are assuming a more moderate LIFO charge. So less of a headwind this year. \n I think one thing to just bear in mind as you think about the year-over-year, we did mitigate where we could, the LIFO charge by taking targeted pricing actions as we saw the market move. So that mitigated the impact of that. So I wouldn't consider this fully a tailwind, but certainly less of a headwind as we go into this year. Yes. So in terms of the cadence for the year, what we said is it really is a back-half story. You really are going to see the growth in the back half of the year. We're not anticipating a sizable drop in the first half. We're looking at it to be modestly up to flattish. But -- so then it's really a back-half story in terms of the earnings. \n In terms of the AP to inventory, what we have seen is the driver of that is really higher inventory levels, coupled with the timing of payments. As you look at the timing of payments, one of the things, for instance, that impacts with the 53rd week, it then pulls in the week 1 rent payment. \n So as we look further, we expect inventory levels to normalize. As you look at -- in Q4, we saw our inventory per store dropped in half. It went -- it was 14% on a per store basis, which was about half the growth rate we saw in the previous period -- or previous quarter. And again, it reflects the same drivers that's really the product cost inflation and a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in NCI as we completed the rollout of that. \n Important thing to note here is it is seasonal goods -- or it's early receipt of seasonal goods or was there other driver. But it's important to note that these are evergreen-type products, which aren't time-sensitive. So we feel really good about the quality of the inventory, the ability to move through that and expect this to continue to normalize as we move through the year. Sure. Again, getting back to the capital, a big driver of that was the inflation as well as the stepped up real estate and the number of projects we're doing in terms of DCs, working on three DCs in one quarter. So again, feel great about the returns of these. \n I don't want to speculate on -- and give future guidance on CapEx. Could see an environment where with the inflation coming down, it would moderate that. But more to come in terms of the CapEx, but what we are really focused on is the returns of these and feel great about the returns and we'll see what's required to grow the business going forward, but more to come. As you think of the algorithm and if you just step back and look over the last 3 years, while it's been up and down over the last 3 years in this environment, every element of that well in excess of the algorithm. If you look at sales comp, well in excess of the algorithm; expansion of gross margin and operating margin; operating income, EPS, well in excess of the algorithm. So we feel very good about the performance over this period of time, and we feel the model remains very strong and very resilient. \n We continue to see ourselves as 10%-plus EPS growers over the long term, not every year. Some years, we see it prudent to invest to protect that growth over the long term. But if you look at the business model and fundamentals, they're very strong with the unique combination of value and convenience resonating as strong as ever. We continue to see very compelling store-level economics in new store returns and then significant bumps from the remodels. And we continue to see 16,000-plus new store opportunities for everybody in our space. But obviously, we've been getting an outsized share of that. So significant runway for growth. \n The initiatives are performing very well, helping both the top line and bottom line. They're focused on both. And we see, as I mentioned, a lot of levers within gross margin to continue to expand that over the long term. And the business generates a lot of cash to then buy back shares and reinvest in the business. So we think top to bottom, the business model and fundamentals remain very strong. I don't want to give specific guidance, but I would just say we feel very good about the future and the strength of the business. Yes. As you think of the headwinds and the tailwinds, I'll start with the headwinds, but then go to what we see as a pretty sizable tailwind -- tailwinds. The ones we talked about were one, sales mix, that pressure continuing. So we've assumed that. We've also assumed shrink and damages as we move through the first half, in particular. And then increased markdowns, and that's really just getting back to rates more in line with historical norms. \n I wouldn't say of these one really stands out significantly over the others, but they all contribute as headwinds. And then, again, the shrink and damages more of a first half pressure than back half as we see it now. Damages, in particular, Q1 pressure as you look at the cadence of the year. \n We mentioned the LIFO impact, and we do think that will provide some benefit, but I wouldn't flow the whole thing through because you had the pricing that went with that last year. \n But then as you think of the tailwinds, the biggest one I would point to and the biggest overall driver I would point to here is the supply chain. We expect a pretty material benefit from lapping the increased supply chain expenses in the second half of last year as well as the sizable benefits from greater distribution center capacity and productivity, lower carrier rates as well as the benefit of expanding our private tractor fleet, which we're growing from 1,600 tractors at the end of last year to over 2,000 by the end of next year. \n And again, as we make those conversions, it's about a 20% savings in addition to other benefits that we expect as we optimize DG Fresh, NCI, and then expect a pretty sizable benefit from DG Media Network to name a few. And then obviously, we intend to leverage our scale as we have as a limited SKU operator, and that's another lever amongst the other levers we've mentioned in the past. \n So again, as you look at the guide for the year, we gave the top line, the bottom line, we didn't give gross margin, but I think it implies a pretty healthy operating profit growth than rates overall despite pretty sizable investment in the business."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their dedication to serving our customers and communities this year. I am inspired by this team's commitment to our mission of serving others and the passion they have for helping our customers save time and money every day. \n Our fourth quarter performance was led by strong comp sales growth of 5.7%. And while this result was below our expectations, our performance included market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and contributed to a net sales increase of 17.9% to $10.2 billion. \n Our Q4 comp sales were driven by an increase in average basket size, primarily attributable to inflation and partially offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic, primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic in late December. And similar to recent quarters, average units per basket were down. Notably, both November and January comp sales at 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively, were within our expected range of 6% to 7% for the quarter. However, our December sales performance was negatively impacted by winter storm Elliott, which had the most significant effect on our stores in the final days leading up to Christmas. The quarter was also impacted by greater-than-anticipated inventory damages, which contributed to diluted EPS results that were below our expectations. \n While the storm had some damages impact, we also incurred higher damages than expected as we work through the residual impact of the storage capacity constraints and related store and distribution inefficiencies we experienced during the second half of the year. Although we expect some of these related impacts to be with us through the end of Q1, we are pleased to have the storage capacity constraints largely behind us, which we believe positions us well moving forward. \n Turning to a few highlights of the 2022 fiscal year. Net sales increased 10.6% to $37.8 billion and included a benefit of approximately 2 percentage points or $678 million in sales from the 53rd week. Comp sales for the year increased 4.3%, driven by strong growth in basket size. Although a significant portion of the basket growth was attributable to inflation, we were pleased to see an average basket size at the end of the year of more than five items and nearly $17. \n The team accomplished a great deal in 2022, and we closed the year with significant progress on our strategic initiatives and operating priorities while achieving several key milestones in Q4 and the weeks thereafter. \n We were particularly excited to celebrate the opening of our 19,000 store in Joplin, Missouri in January, as we continue to support our customers with our unique combination of value and convenience in their hometown communities. We also completed the initial rollout of our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI with the offering now in nearly all of our stores across the chain. \n Finally, we made strong progress in our supply chain, reducing our storage capacity constraints and improving operations during the quarter. More specifically, and as we said we would do, we added significant capacity in Q4, bringing nearly 3 million square feet of distribution capacity online. These efforts culminated with the opening of our newest distribution center in Blair, Nebraska during the quarter. \n I also want to highlight that we have started 2023 with the opening of our first store in Mexico. And while the store has only been open a few short weeks, we are very encouraged by the early response from our new customers. These achievements are a testament to this team's hard work and continued focus on execution and innovation as we continue to deliver on our mission of serving others. \n Turning now to an update on our customers. In addition to adjusting the mix of their baskets, we continue to see customers shift spending to more affordable options, including our private brands, which represent more than 20% of our total sales. Within consumables, private brand growth, both in absolute dollars and penetration was the highest in the fourth quarter. We also increased our share of wallet and share of trips across all segments of our core customer in Q4, and we believe we will be increasingly important to them in the year ahead. \n With regard to trade-in behavior, customers and income brackets above our core customers are shopping with us at an increasing rate, underscoring our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers. \n We remain focused on our goal to be priced at relative parity with mass merchants and we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and all classes of trade. Furthermore, given the strong demand from customers, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point. Notably, during Q4, our comp sales were over 30% in our Value Valley set, which is comprised entirely of items at the $1 price point. \n Overall, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of this program and the value it offers to our customers. In addition, we believe we are well positioned to continue serving both new and existing customers, and we are moving with great intentionality to build on our momentum. \n To this end, we are excited about our plans for 2023. Building on the investments we made in 2022, we plan to make a larger targeted incremental investment of approximately $100 million in our stores this year. This investment will primarily consist of incremental labor hours to support our expectations regarding consistent store standards while further enhancing the associate and customer experience. \n In turn, we believe this investment will position us to drive greater on-shelf availability and capture additional market share while amplifying the potential of our initiatives and ensuring our readiness for our growing customer base. \n And with the progress we have made in the supply chain, the prior investments we have made in wages, and the growing customer engagement we are seeing, we believe we are well positioned to see a meaningful return on this investment. We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we believe our innovation will continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n In summary, we are excited about our plans to deliver strong growth in 2023 while also making significant and deliberate investments in the business. We believe our customer and communities will need us even more as we move throughout 2023. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, we are well positioned to serve them while also creating long-term value for our shareholders. \n With that, I will turn the call over to John. Thank you, John. Let me take a few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, which have transformed this company in recent years, resulting in strong growth and enhanced profitability.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Starting with NCI. With the initial rollout phase now complete, we will focus on continuing to refine the assortment and enhance the treasure hunt offering to provide value to our customers in the nonconsumable categories. Overall, we are very pleased with the success of NCI including market share gains in nonconsumable sales in Q4. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 37 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 140 at the end of 2022, located within 14 states. \n While sales in this economic environment have been somewhat softer than our earlier results, we continue to be pleased with the customer response. Looking ahead, we plan to more than double the pOpshelf shell store count in 2023, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to nearly 300 by year-end, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. We are now delivering perishable products to more than 19,000 stores from 12 facilities, and we continue to be pleased with the cost savings from this initiative and importantly, the significantly enhanced profitability of our perishables offering. \n In addition to capturing cost savings, DG Fresh also aims to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during 2022. \n Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, at the end of 2022, we offered fresh produce in more than 3,200 stores with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 5,000 stores by the end of 2023. \n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During 2022, we added more than 66,000 cooler doors across our store base. And we plan to install a similar number of cooler doors in 2023. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made and savings we realized to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have an opportunity to drive significant additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. As a reminder, the initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 4,400 stores at the end of 2022, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 5,500 stores by the end of 2023. \n Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering and testing of our mobile clinic with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately, services over time, particularly in rural America. \n Finally, we also plan to make significant enhancements to our private brand offering in 2023 as we know how important these value offerings are for our customers. We are increasing private brand offerings across many important categories, including candy and snacks, perishables, pet food and over-the-counter health care products. We believe these products will further differentiate Dollar General in the marketplace as we look to provide our customers with tremendous value on quality products. \n In addition to the initiatives I just discussed, as well as the anticipated supply chain efficiencies I mentioned earlier, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in global sourcing as well as shrink and damage reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2022, we completed a total of 2,961 real estate projects, including 1,039 new stores, 1,795 remodels and 127 relocations. \n For 2023, our goal remains to execute approximately 3,170 real estate projects in the United States across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 store relocations. Notably, this would be the most real estate projects we have executed in 1 year. \n Our ability to innovate on the store formats continues to be an important strength for the business, and we expect to leverage multiple formats to drive strong returns in the year ahead. Approximately 80% of our new stores in nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional store. \n With regard to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which provides the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add fresh produce in many stores. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are excited about our international expansion. We were pleased to open our first Mi Super Dollar General in Monterrey, Mexico last month, and we have been very encouraged by the customer response and community reception we have seen so far. \n Looking ahead, our goal is to have approximately 20 stores serving underserved communities in Northern Mexico by the end of 2023 as we look to leverage our brand awareness while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. \n Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended 2022 with approximately 4.5 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to continue to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to serve us as an important extension of the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. DoorDash is available in nearly 14,000 stores, and we anticipate extending this offering to an additional 1,000 stores in 2023. We are pleased with the incremental sales growth attributed to this partnership as well as its profitability, and we believe we have an opportunity to drive even stronger growth moving forward. \n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique customer profiles, especially rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country. We expect our DG Media Network to grow significantly in 2023 as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners while substantially increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach. The first phase of this initiative, which included rolltainer optimization and self-checkout is focused on enhancing customer convenience and labor productivity in our stores. Self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, was available in more than 11,000 stores at the end of 2022, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. \n Looking ahead, our goal is to have a self-checkout offering in more than 13,000 stores by the end of 2023, including the full self-checkout option in more than 2,000 stores as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consist of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams while laying the foundation for additional phases of Fast Track in the future. \n We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private tractor fleet, which is one of the largest private retail fleets in the U.S. Our fleet consisted of more than 1,600 tractors at the end of 2022 and accounted for more than 40% of our outbound transportation needs. Looking ahead, we plan to have more than 2,000 tractors in our private fleet by the end of 2023, which would account for more than 50% of our outbound transportation fleet. \n Overall, our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we created more than 10,000 new jobs in 2022, while continuing to drive opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement. Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 70% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, more than 10% of our growing private fleet team, which nearly doubled in size in 2022, began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. \n We continue to have great success hiring the talent we need, and we are pleased with our staffing levels and applicant flow. Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is what sets Dollar General apart from the competition and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n We added incredible individuals across the organization in 2022 as we grew teams in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center, while also adding a local team in Mexico to support our new customers in those communities. \n In addition to new opportunities, we have made significant investments in our people, including raising average hourly retail wages by approximately 23% over the last 3 years and investing over 4 million training hours in 2022 to promote education and development. The people of Dollar General are our greatest strength and the driving force of this company. \n In closing, we made great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives in 2022, while making a difference in the lives of our customers. As we enter 2023, we are excited about our robust plans for growth, which we believe will further enhance our ability to serve our customers in meaningful ways. We are the innovation leader in our space, and we are laser-focused on executing at a high level to continue driving long-term sustainable growth while delivering strong returns for our shareholders. \n Finally, I want to thank more than 170,000 employees for their commitment to serving others every day, and I am looking forward to all we will accomplish together in 2023. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Well, Simeon, thank you for the question. I first want to say, certainly, the last 2 quarters have been challenging. And I can tell you, we're disappointed in our results. This team takes great pride in delivering on our commitments and we've been doing that for the almost 30 years I've been here. And that is something that is not changing. And I can tell you, we have a tremendously deep and outstanding team that's laser focused on executing and innovating over the long term.\n And certainly, we have faced some challenges. But what we do here at Dollar General is we control what we can control, and that has allowed us to emerge even stronger as we move forward. So as I think about our balance between execution and innovation, one of the things I think it's important to remember is we have a long track record of execution, and this team will continue to deliver on that. \n And on the innovation front, we don't do things on the side of our desks. And so as we do innovate, one of the things that our team does more than anything is, as you know, capital is not an issue for us. It's all about organizational capacity. And I think the team has done an excellent job of making sure that we've dedicated the resources, the focus and the time to be able to grow this foundation. And it certainly served us very well. \n If you think about these challenging times we're in right now, this company is in a much different place. And as our customer has gravitated towards more consumables, the investments we've made in our strategic initiatives have allowed us to serve her even better and more profitably. \n And so as we look forward, we're excited about some of the investments we announced today, which will be on top of the strategic investments we've made previously, which has put us in a very, very enviable position of having a rock-solid foundation strategically and a laser-focused on execution. And this team is committed to delivering that as we look forward into '23 and beyond. Yes. We absolutely do, Simeon, and that's one of the -- that's a great distinction. Here, at Dollar General, for the 85 years we've been around, the store has always been the company. And our ability to serve local communities is something that we do better than anybody and we take great pride in that. \n And so when you think about the investment that we're very excited about, the reason why it's in hours rather than wages is because we've been paying competitive wages for many years. And you heard in my prepared comments that our wages have increased 23% over the last 3 years. So our ability to attract and retain talent remains one of our core competencies. \n And so I'm -- the other thing you got to remember is where our stores are located. They're located in rural communities. 75% are in communities at 20,000 or less. And we prevent -- we provide career growth opportunities that are unmatched in retail, which leads to our staffing levels being very robust, which we mentioned. And that gives us the opportunity because we're in such a good position to invest in the hours. \n And so as we think about hours, we're pleased at what we believe this will do to elevate our store standards and our consistency, which we believe the customer will benefit and the associate will benefit. \n And so as you -- as we move throughout '23, when you combine the improvements we're making in our supply chain, which really gives us the timing to do this, and you combine that with the in-stock improvements, our customers will begin to see our standards improve, our on-shelf availability will improve, and we'll be ready to serve that growing customer base that we're really pleased that we're seeing. \n And so that's what gives us the confidence in this. We feel this is the right level of investment. And the reason we feel that way is because we've been testing and learning this in 2022. You know Dollar General very well. We don't do things just on a whim. We test and learn. We've been doing that in '22. We liked what we saw. And we wanted to make sure our supply chain was in a position where we could take advantage of the ability to elevate the experience for the customer while we flow goods freely to the stores. \n And right now, we're in a good position to do that as we enter '23, and we're excited about what this is going to do for the customer and ultimately, the return we're going to see over time. Well, thanks, Matt. I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to John. As you think about the customer, one of the good things about Dollar General is we're an all-weather brand. And we've shown over the last 3 decades how we can serve that customer in any economic environment. \n But what we're seeing right now with our customer is the best news we have is that she's still employed. And as we've talked about for many years, that is the single most important factor to her economic health. But we are certainly, as we talk to our customers, and as you know, Matt, we do this very, very frequently, and our digital capabilities allow us to do it in many different ways, which we're pleased, we're seeing that she's worse off financially. \n And it's primarily due to food inflation. And obviously, as you think about how that changes her behaviors, one of the things we're seeing is she's relying more on savings, credit cards, and also borrowing money, quite frankly, from friends. And as that shows up in the store, what we're seeing in the shopping behavior is that translates into our customer coming more often, she's buying fewer items on occasion. \n And I got to tell you, one of the things we're very, very pleased with is the fact that we are still leaning hard into our dollar price point. And we're there for that customer. And as you saw in our prepared comments, that is resonating extremely well with her, as you saw from the comp sales we're seeing in that category. But also, we're seeing her lean into private brands, and we're seeing her shift her purchases more to consumables. \n But as you know, our core customer, she's the smartest customer, I believe, in retail, and she figures this out over time. And our box is more relevant than ever as a result of the investments we've made over the last several years. And that allows us to go where the customer wants us to go and do it more profitably. And that's a very enviable position for us, and I think our market share gains kind of show that. \n But that's kind of what we're seeing from the customer standpoint. And certainly, there's some near-term challenges that have just recently emerged. I'll let John talk about that in Q1. Rupesh, you're right. We are very excited about what we're seeing on our DG Media Network. And quite frankly, our digital acceleration in general. One of the things that we've learned over the last couple of years when we started this journey was how digitally savvy our customer is and how much it helps her to be more connected and more loyal to Dollar General and it shows up in her ability to spend with us. \n Certainly, as you think about the network and you think about what we're able to bring to the market, we're able to bring access to a segment of the population that's really difficult to connect with. And when you think about the rural population, 30% of the United States population, that's meaningful. And that's why our brand partners and our CPG partners are very excited to partner with DG, and we're excited about where the media network will go over time. \n In terms of kind of how we handle the dollars that we're receiving from that, obviously, one of the things that's great about this company is our ability to grow our operating profit and reinvest in the business. And this is one of the ways it allows us to do that. And so that's why we're all very excited about the strategic foundation we've built here, the muscle we've built. And we're excited about some of the initiatives that we're going to bring to the forefront as we look forward, especially in '23 and beyond. Yes, it's Karen. I'll take the first part of that question, and then John, I'll kick it to you for the algorithm question. But Karen, we don't disclose our average hourly rate. But what I can tell you is, as I said earlier, is we have and we continue to pay very competitive wages. And I think the one nuance to Dollar General that I frankly believe is underappreciated is the ability to come into this company as a part-time sales associate and grow into a career. .\n And you can do it faster than you can in any other retailer because we're committed to internal development, and we have the opportunity to provide you with growth opportunities because of our dynamic growth.\n So I think those two things are the reason why we feel great about our staffing levels, our ability to attract and our ability to retain our talent. And so that's why we're investing in hours. And right now, we're very pleased to see that wage grow 23% over the last 3 years. So we're in a great position, and that's why we're able to put this investment more towards the hours in the store rather than having to catch up on wages. And John? Well, Corey, first of all, we are very pleased at the market share gains that we've been able to achieve, both on the consumable and on the nonconsumable segments of our business. And when you think about our customers as well, we're also incredibly pleased with the fact that we were able to increase our productivity with really all segments of our core customer.\n We increased our share of wallet, our share of trips. Those are all really encouraging signs and very pleased to see that. It's a credit to our team and their ability to connect with this customer, bring an assortment that she's looking for and delivered in a consistent fashion. \n As you think about the donors, it's really the same donors we've had for quite some time, primarily drug is our biggest share donor. And so as we look forward to continuing to refine our assortment, our strategic initiatives, really allow us to really bring even more, we believe, relevant assortment to our customer. We think we're in the early to mid-innings on many of these initiatives when you think about our treasure hunt with NCI, when you think about DG Fresh and the relevance of the perishable and frozen offering, you think about produce. \n And we're very pleased on our digital strategy that's allowing us to, quite frankly, through our first-party data, our ability to understand this customer on an even greater level than we ever have before, we'll be able to continue to bring the relevance she's looking for. And when you think about our growing store base, we continue to see our share opportunity very, very optimistically, and we would expect us to continue to take it from the same donors we've seen in previous. I'd like to thank you all for your questions and your interest in Dollar General. And while our operating environment is dynamic for our customer and business, we are staying focused on the things that we can control, which is continued innovation and execution in our business. \n If I could summarize our discussion today, I'd like to leave you with these three things. First, we have a powerful growth strategy. Second, we are investing in the future. And third, we are doing this while also planning to deliver strong results in 2023. \n We're excited about this business, and I am confident we are well positioned to serve our customers and also create value for our shareholders in the year ahead. Thank you for your listening today, and I hope you have a great day."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, December 1, 2022, [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.\n Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations.

[Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our entire team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other.\n The quarter was highlighted by strong performance on the top line, led by comp sales growth of 6.8% and included increases in traffic and in market share of both consumable and nonconsumable product sales.\n During the quarter, we experienced significantly higher-than-anticipated cost pressures, including challenges within our internal supply chain, sales mix pressures and higher inventory damages and shrink, all of which impacted gross margin. We will elaborate more on these cost pressures in a bit.\n But despite these challenges, we delivered a double-digit increase in diluted earnings per share, along with strong same-store sales growth. As the economic environment continued to evolve during the quarter, we remain focused on serving the needs of our core customer.\n We continue to see customer behaviors in Q3 that we believe indicate they are feeling increased financial pressure, including reductions in the number of items purchased per basket and in discretionary spending, which was softer than anticipated during the quarter.\n Customers also continued to shift spending to more affordable options, such as items that are dollar price point and private brands, while also shopping closer to payday at the first of the month. Importantly, we are growing more productive with our core customer as well as seeing an increase in customers with annual household incomes up to $100,000.\n This growth underscores our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers and will continue to be important to all customers in this challenging economic environment. In turn, we remain focused on delivering value and convenience and continue to feel good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade.\n Further, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 price point, and we're pleased with the strong comp sales performance of these products during Q3, as they collectively outperformed the chain average. With nearly 19,000 stores, located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to support our customers even in a challenging economic environment.\n We're building on this foundation, I'm excited to share our real estate growth plans for next year. In fiscal 2023, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States including 1,050 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. I'll share more details on these plans in just a few minutes, along with an update on our plans for our supply chain as we continue to support our significant growth.\n But first, let me recap some additional financial results for the third quarter. Our strong comp sales performance helped drive a net sales increase of 11.1% to $9.5 billion. From a monthly cadence perspective, the comp sales momentum we saw building in Q2 continued into all 3 months of Q3, with September being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to note that Q4 sales are off to a strong start as well.\n Our Q3 comp sales were primarily driven by an increase in average transaction amount, largely driven by inflation. And as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment, average units per basket were down.\n As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to see a second consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic contribute to the growth. With regards to the supply chain cost pressures I mentioned earlier, I want to touch on what happened and the actions we have taken to address these challenges. As a reminder, since the early days of the pandemic over 2 years ago, we have seen demand and sales grow at a robust pace.\n In addition, the overall mix of products we are shipping has evolved significantly with the growth of our nonconsumable initiative in pOpshelf. As our distribution needs grew and evolved, we strategically designed permanent warehouse capacity solutions to support our growth.\n We plan for them to be operational starting in the back half of this year while making greater use of temporary storage facilities in the near-term. However, as we move through Q3, we experienced unexpected delays in opening additional temporary storage facilities, primarily due to external challenges such as permitting.\n At the same time, seasonal goods came in earlier than anticipated. The resulting constraints from these factors led to more than $40 million and additional supply chain costs in Q3 compared to what we had previously expected.\n These costs included retention fees incurred for delays in returning shipping containers. Costs associated with inefficiencies in moving freight within our distribution centers and higher transportation costs as a result of servicing stores from less-than-optimal distribution center alignments.\n While these issues have resulted in a gross margin headwind in the back half of this year, the team has worked hard to move past these delays with the opening of additional storage and warehouse facilities, which have already begun to relieve some of the capacity pressures.\n In fact, within the past few weeks, we increased capacity by more than 2 million square feet with the opening of 2 new permanent regional distribution hubs in Georgia and Texas, which will serve as intermediary facilities between import points and the rest of our distribution centers.\n With the opening of both the temporary and permanent facilities, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued improvement as we move ahead, as we better optimize store alignment with distribution centers, lower capacity utilization within our existing footprint and improve the overall flow of goods.\n Of note, these regional hubs will be followed by the opening of our new combination distribution center in Nebraska, which is scheduled to begin shipping by the end of this fiscal year. In addition, our previously announced facilities in Arkansas, Colorado and Oregon are expected to come online over the next 18 months.\n Collectively, all of these new distribution centers will ultimately result in a more than 20% increase in total capacity and position us well to support continued growth in the years to come.\n Overall, while internal supply chain challenges have impacted our EPS outlook for 2022, we believe the significant growth in demand that contributed to these challenges is a testament to the growing relevance of Dollar General. And we are confident in our plans to support this growth going forward.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives from a position of strength, as we continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.\n We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, our transformational strategic actions have positioned us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation.\n With that, I will turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details, beginning with gross profit.\n Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.5%, a decrease of 27 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable category as well as increases in distribution costs, markdowns, inventory shrink and damages partially offset by higher inventory markups.\n Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $148 million during the quarter. And while we believe cost increases are beginning to moderate, we anticipate LIFO will continue to pressure Q4 as well.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.7%, a decrease of 23 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, incentive compensation, hurricane-related disaster expenses and occupancy costs. These were partially offset by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, including utilities, repairs and maintenance and travel and training costs.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 10.5% to $736 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 4 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% and compares to 22.2% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the third quarter increased 12% to $2.33.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long-term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders.\n Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 34.8% overall and 28.4% on a per store basis.  Similar to the first half of the year, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of our non-consumables' initiative, and the early receipt of seasonal goods.\n Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape, and we anticipate that we will begin to see lower levels of inventory growth beginning in Q4.\n Moving down the balance sheet. We issued $2.3 billion of senior notes during Q3, and we now expect to incur total interest expense of approximately $210 million for the full year, an increase of approximately $53 million over the prior year.\n Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $1.2 billion, a decrease of 44%, primarily due to higher inventory purchases.\n Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $546 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $123 million. At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders, to anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. On year-to-date sales performance and our expectations for the remainder of Q4, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 full year expectations for net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week, and we are updating our expectation for same-store sales growth for Q4, which we expect same-store sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%, which would result in growth toward the upper end of our previous range of approximately 4% to 4.5%.\n Turning to gross margin. We've experienced many challenges over the course of this year, including those related to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics and the evolution of consumer spending. Since our last update and like many retailers, we have seen an increased headwind from lower-margin consumables, sales mix as customers face growing financial pressure. We expect this headwind to grow in Q4 as our guidance assumes customers continue to feel financial pressures and shift more of their spending to consumable items.\n And while we are making good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints, we expect some of the cost pressures we have experienced as a result of the delays will carry over into Q4, but will be largely resolved by Q1 of next year. Finally, we are seeing a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages than we anticipated for the back half of this year.\n Overall, while we are confident in the actions, we are taking to address our supply chain challenges, we anticipate the total headwind to gross margin in Q4 from all of these factors will be higher than what we previously contemplated within our financial guidance. With all this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance.\n For the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.30, which would result in a growth for the full year of approximately 7% to 8%. This is compared to our previous expectation of 12% to 14% EPS for the full year. Both the current and previous ranges include an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. And our EPS outlook now assumes an effective tax rate toward the upper end of the previously provided range of 22% to 22.5%.\n We now expect capital spending for 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion, which is at the top end of our previously stated range. Finally, our expectations for share repurchases remain unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 25, 2022.\n Overall, despite the near-term challenges, we are confident in the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we plan to share 2023 guidance on the Q4 call, we feel good about the sales momentum going into next year, coupled with moderating cost pressures.\n Let me provide some additional context as it relates to our Q4 outlook. As a reminder, we expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI through the remainder of the year. In addition, we expect the significant expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits going forward despite anticipated continued internal supply chain pressures in the near-term.\n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect these initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022, as we expect our benefits to gross margin will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n Consistent with Q2 and Q3, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, primarily toward incremental labor hours to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer experience.\n Finally, we also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track and are seeing savings in 2022, offsetting a portion of wage inflation. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long-term. We're working hard to address the near-term challenges, most of which we believe will be behind us as we enter 2023.\n Importantly, we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are continuing to make significant progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 16,000 stores at the end of the third quarter. With over 75% of the assortment at $5 or less, this treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with customers who are seeking value. We continue to be pleased with the sales and margin performance we are seeing from our NCI offering, including market share growth in nonconsumable product categories.\n Looking ahead, we expect to realize ongoing benefits from this initiative throughout the remainder of the year and remain on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by year-end.\n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less.\n We recently celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the first pOpshelf store, along with our 100th store opening. And we are pleased to see the concept continuing to resonate with customers.\n During the quarter, we opened 23 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 103 located within 9 states. Additionally, we opened 15 new store-within-a-store concepts during Q3, bringing the total number of Dollar General market stores with a smaller footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 40.\n We remain on track to nearly triple the stand-alone pOpshelf store count this year, which would bring us to a total of nearly 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations by year-end.\n Looking ahead, we plan to nearly double the pOpshelf store count next year, as our real estate plans for 2023 include opening approximately 150 additional locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 300 by the end of 2023. Overall, we remain excited about the pOpshelf concept and our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas.\n As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishable department.\n Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh, as we continue to optimize our network further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.\n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time.\n To that end, we offered Fresh produce in more than 3,000 stores at the end of Q3. And looking ahead, plan to add produce in approximately 2,000 stores in 2023, for a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of next year.\n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During Q3, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022.\n Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.\n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of Q3, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022.\n As we seek to further connect customers with our expanded health offering, we have recently launched a partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores.\n And most recently, I'm excited to announce that we launched a pilot of a mobile health clinic provided by DocGo On-Demand to provide basic preventative and urgent care services at a small number of stores in Q3. We plan to test this offering in select stores over the next few months as we continue to work with customers on how to help bring affordable health and wellness closer to home, while further establishing Dollar General as a trusted health partner in the local community.\n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink and damage reduction.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business.\n In the third quarter, we completed a total of 798 real estate projects, including 268 new stores, 485 remodels and 45 relocations. For 2022, we now plan to execute approximately 2,945 real estate projects in total, including 1,025 new stores, 1,795 remodels and approximately 125 store relocations.\n Looking ahead, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States in 2023 across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 relocations.\n Our ability to innovate our store formats continues to be an important strength of the business, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our 2023 real estate strategy.\n Approximately 80% of our new stores and nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional box.\n With regards to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add Fresh produce in many stores.\n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and our goal is to open our first store in Mexico by the end of this fiscal year.\n As a reminder, these stores, which will be branded under the name [ MeSuper ] Dollar General will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico. Looking ahead, we plan to have up to 35 stores open in Mexico by the end of 2023, as we look to extend our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. These stores will be incremental to our planned 1,050 new store openings.\n As we head into 2023, our real estate pipeline remains robust. We see more than 16,000 total opportunities for small box retail stores in the United States, including more than 12,000 for Dollar General stores, approximately 3,000 for pOpshelf and approximately 1,000 for DGX. With these opportunities and our existing footprint of more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any other retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint, as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers.\n Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers, as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q3 with over 4.5 million monthly active users on the app, and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings.\n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of Q3, and we are very pleased with the year-to-date sales results.\n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands, who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the U.S.\n After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business. As we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions.\n This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience.\n The current focus of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 10,500 stores at the end of Q3, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates.\n We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staff register, if preferred.\n We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We are currently testing this layout in approximately 250 stores and are pleased with the early customer and associate response.\n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail.\n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams.\n We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,300 tractors at the end of Q3. As a reminder, we have been focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year.\n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement.\n Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by the more than 70% of our store employees at or above the lead sales associate position who were placed from within.\n In addition, approximately 15% of our growing private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We are pleased with our turnover trends and staffing levels. And applicant flow continues to be strong, further validating our confidence that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent.\n Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique, competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n We also recently completed our annual Community Giving Campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people.\n We continue to add incredible talent across the organization in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center. As this new talent joins our tremendous team, I am continually reminded that the people of Dollar General are our greatest strength.\n In closing, I am excited about the future as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, with the number of initiatives we have in place and a unique and strong strategic planning process, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth, while creating meaningful shareholder value.\n Finally, as we are in the midst of our busy holiday season, I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their commitment every day to serve our customers.  I am excited about our work together as we head into the final weeks of our year.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. So Jeff, maybe first, could you elaborate on what you think is driving the sequential acceleration in same-store sales? I think traffic has now sequentially improved for the second straight quarter. What are you seeing across the income cohort?\n And then maybe just looking back at past periods of consumer pressure, how sustainable do you see the market share opportunity in front of us? \nJeffery Owen: Thanks, Matt. We are very pleased with our 6.8% comp sales increase. And as you mentioned, seeing traffic accelerate again for the second consecutive quarter was very nice to see, and also continuing to grow market share. We grew market share in our consumables and our nonconsumable business.\n And so when you think about that, our outperformance on sales really was driven in the consumables business, and it really is a testament to our going where the customer wants us to go. And that is something we've always done here at Dollar General. And I think it's a testament to the relevance of our box.\n When you think about our box and how we've continued to make it a fuller fill in shop, it really speaks to our ability to serve a broad spectrum of customers. And as you mentioned, with customers -- our core customer, one thing that is encouraging to see is she's still gainfully employed. And we've long said that is the single greatest factor in her economic health. So it's encouraging to see that, and it's encouraging to see us grow productivity and share with her.\n And also the encouraging thing we saw this quarter is we grew share in all income levels. And so that's particularly good to see when you think about the higher income levels. One of the things we've been very pleased at is our ability to retain that COVID customer higher than we expected to over the course of several quarters, and we continue to see that here. And we also saw us grow share and customers in the $100,000 income level.\n So when you step back and think about it, it again just points to our ability to serve multiple income cohorts. And that will set us up extremely well as we look to the future and our ability to not only make our core customer more productive, but also the ability to retain these new customers. So we feel real good about that.\n And as I mentioned around the consumable business, we're pleased with the performance there. And I think the thing to keep in mind, as you step back and you think about where Dollar General is today, our consumable business is a much different business from a profitability standpoint due to our strategic initiatives.\n When you think about NCI, our health offering, DG Fresh, it really has made that business a different business from a profitability standpoint. In fact, in the third quarter, our gross margin is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019, just to give you a little bit of color there.\n So again, we feel good about the top line. And as we look forward, we feel we're really well positioned to serve a multiple cohorts of customers in this economic environment. And I'd also say that we're excited to deliver more real estate projects in 2023 than we've ever done at Dollar General.\n And I think it's a testament to the robust pipeline and then also the strategic initiatives. So I feel real good about where we are from a sales standpoint and our position to be able to serve our broad customer base as we look forward. \nMatthew Boss: That's great. And then maybe, John, on gross margin and just to break down some of the components.\n So do you see these warehouse costs and supply chain efficiency is more transitory and contained to the fourth quarter? Help us to think about LIFO going forward relative to the material gross margin headwind this year, should we anticipate should transportation as a tailwind now from here? And just what inning do you see the drivers of inventory markup in today? \nJohn Garratt: Sure, Matt. I'll start with the question around the supply chain costs. And as we called out versus previous expectations, the supply chain costs were a significant headwind more than $40 million above our previous expectations for Q3. And we do see this as near-term. And we're making very good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints as more capacity comes online.\n And we do believe some of these cost pressures, nonetheless, will carry over into Q4. However, we do expect this will largely be resolved in Q1 of next year. So as we look ahead, we anticipate supply chain costs, both internal and external in 2023 to be down quite a bit. We're obviously seeing it improving as others market for carrier costs as well. And so that as a potential tailwind going forward.\n And then LIFO as well. We're seeing the pace that while it will continue to pressure, Q4, we are seeing the pace of cost increases continue to moderate. And as we look at next year, we'd expect less pressure from LIFO. So certainly, some near-term pressures between LIFO between the supply chain cost.\n We also mentioned the sales mix shift and shrink and damages. But as we look to 2023 and beyond, we feel good about, as Jeff mentioned, one, the sales momentum in the business; but also moderating product cost and inflation, particularly around supply chain and LIFO.\n And as you look at the initiatives, we have that continue to contribute the other levers we have, not to mention our scale and where we're at in price, we don't see a need to invest. We feel that we're very well positioned as we look ahead to the future to continue expanding gross margin over the long-term. \nMatthew Boss: That's a great color. Best of luck. \nJohn Garratt: You asked about markdowns as well. I didn't want to miss that question. As you look at markdown risk, while up from the unusually low levels last year, markdowns are still well below pre-pandemic levels. If you look at the majority of the inventory growth, it's really driven by inflation.\n The team has done a good job anticipating the mix shift in consumer demand and has proactively been adjusting orders. And as a result, we feel very good about the quality of the inventory, ability to mitigate the markdown risk. As always, we've set aside, what we believe is an appropriate markdown level for the upcoming Christmas season. And of course, this is all reflected in our guidance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I think a follow-up, John, for you. So this year, you were going to grow earnings sort of in line with [indiscernible] excluding the 53rd week, and now it's going to be below and yet you're doing more sales.\n So there's clearly something coiled up here in the model. I know you're not going to guide next year, but the theoretical framework is there should be some recapture. If there is recapture, are you inclined to let that flow? Or do you manage -- do you think the business just manages towards [indiscernible] and I don't know if it's to reinvest or maybe we don't see all the recapture that I'm hinting at? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. So as you mentioned, we won't be giving specific guidance on this call. We'll certainly share that on the March call. But I'll just start by reiterating that we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, the sales momentum, coupled with the moderating cost pressures that I just articulated. And as you called out, it is a 1 less week next year that's important to bear in mind.\n But again, as you look at the fundamentals of the business, they're very strong. We continue to see ourselves as 10% EPS growers over the long-term. Now we will always balance that with investing back in the business for the long-term, but feel we're very well positioned. And more to come for next year, but feel great about the momentum of the business fundamentals. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And maybe my follow-up, maybe sticking with you on fourth quarter gross margin. I guess, we're trying to build to the pieces, supply chain, mix, shrink. And we're having trouble getting to the entire magnitude. Are you willing to share a little more magnitude by item, by driver? Because it doesn't feel like the consumables mix goes up enough to justify the mix. So there seems like there's something like markdown in there as well. \nJohn Garratt: So as you look at the drivers of the additional pressure on Q4, it's the same drivers as Q3, the order is a little bit different. As you look at what we anticipate as the key pressures on Q4 margins is still healthy flow-through, but less than previously expected.\n The big difference is, first the mix shift. We did see a mix shift in the consumables as customers face financial pressures. We want to go where the customer goes, and like the sales we're seeing, but it does pressure your margin a little bit with the mix of the sales.\n The other piece -- we did see -- we mentioned as we progressed through Q3 is a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages. And that shrink can have a tail to that. Rest assured, the team knows how to deal with this and is taking actions to address it. But it does have a tail to it. And then while we are making good progress resolving our storage capacity constraints with the capacity online, we do believe, as we mentioned, that some of this will carry over into Q4, but be largely resolved by Q1.\n So that's the big versus our previous expectations. Obviously, the other big one is LIFO. As you look at LIFO, we called out $148 million in Q3, while we believe the product cost headwind is beginning to moderate. The prior cost increases will continue to pressure Q4 LIFO, and you could do the math as you do -- as you spread that across the year. So that's really the key drivers.\n But again, I'll just reiterate, many of these are transitory in nature. And as we look ahead to the future, we feel we're well positioned to resume growing our gross margin over the long-term with the initiatives, the levers, our scale and the pricing position we're in. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Congrats on the continued top line momentum and share gains that you've witnessed.\n So with that in mind, maybe could you parse out a little bit what you're seeing in terms of how the customer is behaving because it's clear that traffic is up. The customer is visiting the store more and should -- maybe shifting a little bit into private label. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that regard and how you're investing to continue to support the growth in that segment?\n And then secondarily, as you see that mix shift happen more to the consumable side, how do you marry that with the continued growth that you're likely to see in NCI, which should actually help to underpin, I would say, better profitability as we look ahead? \nJeffery Owen: Corey, this is Jeff. Thank you for your question. And I'll start with the customer.\n I'll reiterate the fact that her gainfully being employed is, again, a very important factor to economic health. And so when we talk to our customers, and I feel like our teams do that better than just about anybody. What we hear is she's feeling the pressure of energy prices and fuel and just the everyday needs are -- it's hard to -- for her to make ends meet.\n And so she's behaving pretty much exactly the way we would expect her to in times like this. So what we're seeing from her is, as you alluded to, she's coming to us more often. She's buying fewer items on each occasion. And one of the things that we're very pleased is we're being able to help serve her needs through affordability. And our leaning into the dollar price point, our customer is responding incredibly well to that.\n And I just -- a testament to our team and to our ability to go where the customer wants us to around our $1 price point and affordability.\n But when you think about the consumable business, as you mentioned before, you got again, really step back and think about the strategic initiatives and how that has allowed us to really have a more profitable business there. And we've long used consumables to drive traffic and nonconsumables to build the basket.\n And so as we think about our -- excuse me, the nonconsumable, as you mentioned, certainly, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing on NCI, and its ability to really provide that value. When you think about NCI, 80% of the items are $5 or less.\n And so when you think about our ability to drive traffic through consumables, and then also see a little bit of our ability to rotate the product, the treasure hunt, our breadth strategy. We feel real good about our ability to help that customer continue to get the things they need and the things that they want.\n One last thing I'll say around private brand. I mean, we continue to be very pleased with what we're seeing on penetration. But the other thing you got to keep in mind is our customer, again, she's very brand-focused as well. And it's very important to her. And that's where it's important to really lean into our scale.\n As John mentioned earlier, the ability of Dollar General and a limited SKU retailer to be able to trade out brands, if necessary for our customer is a really, really powerful way for us to serve for better. And we've said this before, but our customer treats a brand as a brand. And so it gives us the ability to make sure that we're providing her with the value she needs. And our merchant team does that probably better than anybody in retail, in my view.\n So as you step back and think about it, we feel we're well positioned and really excited about our ability to continue to listen to our customer go where she wants us to go. And you combine that with the more profitable consumable business and our strategic initiatives and really set up nicely for us to continue to serve her, as we've done for many, many years in all economic cycles. \nCorey Tarlowe: That's great. And then thanks for laying out the new store plans for next year. I think that helps to really provide a little bit more color as to the predictability and stability that we should expect ahead. Could you talk a little bit more about the strong returns that you're continuing to see on those new stores? And what we should expect more so from a continued ROIC standpoint as it relates to some of these new stores as we look ahead? \nJeffery Owen: Yes, Corey, I'll start and then I'll let John fill in on some of your questions around returns.\n But our real estate model continues to be a huge strength of this business. I mean the low-risk and high-return model is incredibly powerful. And when you think about the retail landscape today, when you think about some of the challenges other retailers have talked about on the real estate front, I'm just very, very excited and proud of the fact that we're going to deliver more projects than we ever have at Dollar General in 2023.\n And with 1,050 new stores, it continues to just highlight our ability to serve the customer and our ability through format innovation, our real estate model, our technology, we're able to go where the customer needs us to go. And so feel great about that. And really pleased at the fact, through format innovation, this larger store we're opening, our new store performance has been incredibly positive.\n And I'm very, very pleased at our ability to exceed our pro formas, and we continue to see that. So that larger store format is continuing to deliver higher sales per square foot, which is excited. And as you know, the large majority of our openings are in that larger footprint. But as you think about the next year in the future, I think the other thing that excites us here is the pipeline that we have.\n And on the U.S. alone, we have 16,000 additional opportunities, and we feel great about our ability to capture those. And certainly, our fair share, which we've certainly demonstrated, but 12,000 additional for DG, 3,000 for pOpshelf and then 1,000 for DGX. So stepping back, you can probably hear in my excitement about the real estate and our ability to continue to grow here. And we feel like we're being very prudent in this environment, I'm very, very pleased with the team's performance here.\n So I'll kick it over to John for your return question. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. And just -- echoing Jeff's comments, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. As he mentioned, we're above pro forma in sales, which puts us ahead of schedule in terms of the IRRs. Again, we target a 20% to 22% after-tax IRR based on the sales. And as we outperform in sales, that puts us a little ahead on the returns as well.\n And feel not only great about the -- and again, it's always important to bear in mind that it includes the impact of cannibalization, which is very minimal, has been very consistent, just given the localized nature of the shop. We continue to see paybacks less than 2 years.\n So it continues to be a fantastic investment that we continue to hit the gas on. And we're also really pleased with returns we get on our remodels as well, and we're doing not only a record number of overall projects this year, but a record number of remodels, which really helps drive the comp. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: John, I want to hopefully get some frame of reference on 2 factors that are impacting the gross margin. So, a, you mentioned $40 million of supply chain costs that are above and beyond what you expected, does that go to $30 million in the fourth quarter? And if that's in the right ballpark, you used the term of beat, which you can interpret a lot of different ways. I think what most of the market wants to know is, does abate mean you're going to incur $70 million this year that will go away because those are extraordinary costs next year?\n And as part of that, the other piece of it is the LIFO, which the LIFO headwind because that's needs to be $450 million or so if we just add $100 million for the fourth quarter. If there's a linear path of this inflation, meaning it goes from 9, 8, 7, 6 so forth, would that LIFO headwind that's going to be, call it, $450 million this year, be like $300 million next year, so you get a $150 million benefit? Sorry for so many numbers and so much confusion. \nJohn Garratt: No. No. Thank you, Michael. I'll try and tackle each of these. In terms of the carryover impact of the supply chain costs. We didn't give a specific number on that. It will be less, but still a meaningful impact to us.\n In terms of LIFO, the way to think about that is even though we don't anticipate -- we anticipate a slowdown in the number of price increases. The way you do that number is at a point in time, we project the full year impact of all the price increases we're aware of, and we spread that across the year. So that gets you in the game of what Q4 looks like. And as we look ahead to next year, it remains to be seen, but would anticipate a considerable reduction to that LIFO number.\n So as you look at -- as I mentioned, as you look ahead to next year, we think the supply chain costs will be down considerably because we won't have these near-term onetime costs, we don't anticipate because we think that will be resolved in Q1. And then the market is favorable in terms of just overall transportation costs, both foreign and domestic.\n And of course, we continue to stand up our private fleet, which we're going to -- every time we convert, we take 20% out and we're going to double that in size this year. So that's certainly a significant savings driver for us as well. And so as you look ahead to next year, I think it's safe to assume that there's a number of tailwinds.\n There's certainly some headwinds we mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what the mix does. We want to be there for the customer, and we'll go where she goes. So we have to see where that goes. As we said, shrink has a tail to it. And we're all over it. We know how to attack that, but it does have a bit of a tail.\n So as you look ahead to next year, there's some puts and takes. But again, we feel like there's a lot of tailwinds when you think of LIFO, when you think of the supply chain costs and all the other levers that we've talked about, not to mention the initiatives. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question will be less a bit picky. I'm sorry. The -- we've seen now some cost pressure at Dollar General. This follows a significant decline in profitability your largest competitor. Should we take these as onetime event? Or is there anything to say that just the overall profitability of the small box value convenience sector is permanently under pressure or long-lasting under pressure because of some of the competitive dynamics? Because of the shift to consumables and other factors? Or would you expect that this is not a trend that's going to be long lasting? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. I'll just reiterate, we see most of the pressures as transitory. When you look at the LIFO, when you look at the supply chain, we see that as transitory. We still feel very good about our nonconsumable products, and see this more as a transitory macro pressure.\n Again, we're growing share. We're just kind of following the market trend, which people are just shopping more toward consumables versus discretionary items. But we're taking share and feel that will certainly do very well there as the economy improves.\n And just structurally, we feel we're well positioned in terms of -- as we look at wages, we feel we're well positioned in terms of applicant flow and staffing levels. We feel we're investing appropriately in the business. We feel that our pricing is very appropriate.\n And again, I think it's important to mention that as you look at Q3, yes, we were down 27 basis points in gross margin, but we're still about 1 point above pre-pandemic levels despite all these transitory pressures I mentioned. We're still a point above where we were back in 2019 and Q3. \nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious on the storage capacity and supply chain inefficiencies. If there was a sales impact during the quarter as well as the cost impact that you talked about. Maybe if you could frame that, also, same question, if you expect there to be a sales impact in 4Q? And related to that, was the pressure any region in particular where you saw the cost and/or sales impact? And how much of a differential was there in terms of the performance of that region versus your others? \nJeffery Owen: Yes. Thanks. I'll tell you, as we said before, the delays of our temporary storage facilities, certainly, that unexpected delay did impact the quarter from a profitability standpoint. But again, I reiterate how pleased we were with the strong sales performance we saw. And the nice thing is like it normally is at DG, it's pretty broad-based. And so I think, again, that goes to the consistency of our ability to serve a customer across, not only a broad swath of the United States, but also around the income levels I mentioned earlier.\n And we're very pleased and excited that our temporary storage facilities are now online. We're also excited that our 2 new permanent regional hubs that are going to serve us extremely well. As we look to the future, they're also online. And of course, those things will take some time to get fully productive and to allow us to catch-up.\n So again, I would also mention we're pleased that we had in stock improvement year-over-year in Q3. So again, when you kind of bundle it all together, I think the team did a nice job of overcoming some of these challenges, to deliver for the customer, go where she wants us to go. I think that translated into our strong comp, our strong market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and a second consecutive quarter of sequential traffic increases.\n So again, feel pleased about the top line and feel pleased about where we have opened up our capacity. And finally, I'll just mention, as you look forward over the next 18 months, bringing on 4 permanent facilities, that will increase our capacity by 20%. And is something we factored into our strategic plan and feel great about how that's going to serve us well and allow us to continue to grow this business in the years ahead. \nOperator: Our last question will be from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So just going back to your commentary on shrink. I was curious if you can provide more color in terms of what's driving the higher shrink lately opportunities you guys see to reduce that going forward? If there's any way to quantify how you think about the headwind for Q4 or even what you saw in Q3? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. So as we mentioned, we saw increased shrink later in Q3. We believe this is largely -- Rupesh, largely attributable to the inflationary environment, coupled with higher inventory levels. Overall, as you know, retail is seeing higher shrink in this environment. Now this can have a tail. So we did say we expect this to carry over into Q4. I think it's instructive as we listed out the gross margin drivers, I think that was the last on the list of drivers for Q3. But bear in mind, that was later in Q3.\n So we anticipate a larger -- probably a larger impact if you have a full quarter of that in Q4. But in Q3, it was the smallest of the items we called out. But again, we've done this drill many times. If you look at our shrink levels, they're still very low from a historical perspective, just not quite as low as we were at record levels recently. But the team knows how to execute against this, and I think we're putting the right tactics in place to address it. \n We're increasing the amount of tagging with -- for our EAS units. We're leveraging technology like exception-based reporting, and we have very good process rigor and focus on this to tame it. But we'll have a little bit of tail until these actions take hold. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. So just on trade-in, I know your team expect to trade in to continue into Q3, and I believe Q4 as well. At this point, the trade-in that you're seeing, is that consistent with what you'd see in a recession? Or is it -- would you say it still below what you typically see in downturn? \nJeffery Owen: Yes. Rupesh, as I said earlier, we're very pleased to be able to see that we're growing share in customers across all income levels. So that's encouraging. And really, again, I go back to the relevance of our brand of our box and our tremendous ability to listen and respond to what our customers are looking for.\n And certainly, I would tell you, the core customer is certainly behaving the way we expected her to. And also, as you think about it, one of the things that we continue to be pleased with is the fact that when we were introduced to that new customer during COVID, we continue to retain her at higher-than-expected levels.\n So I would say that as we sit here today, we feel real good about what we're seeing across all the income brackets. We feel real good about seeing the growth there. And I think we're very well positioned to continue to serve them.\n And I think if you step back and think about Dollar General, we're an all-weather brand, and we've been doing this for many, many years, and we continue to do that. And so -- and we will continue to do that. We'll go where the customer wants us to go, which we did this quarter.\n And we're also positioned to continue to do that as we move forward and continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives that really makes a more well-rounded shop and a greater appeal for a broad swath of customers. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Owen for closing comments. \nJeffery Owen: Well, thank you for all the questions and your continued interest in Dollar General.\n I just wanted to wrap up with 3 points. First, while we had some unanticipated challenges within our supply chain during the quarter, we're confident in the actions we've taken to address these near-term issues and expect continued improvement as we move through Q4 and into next year; second, we believe we are well positioned to keep growing market share, especially in an environment where customers are even more focused on value; and third, we believe our strong value and convenience proposition combined with our robust portfolio of strategic initiatives sets us up for a very long runway of growth.\n And we couldn't be more excited about where the future is headed. I want to thank you again for listening, and I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Now that Jeff has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details, beginning with gross profit.\n Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.5%, a decrease of 27 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumable category as well as increases in distribution costs, markdowns, inventory shrink and damages partially offset by higher inventory markups.\n Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $148 million during the quarter. And while we believe cost increases are beginning to moderate, we anticipate LIFO will continue to pressure Q4 as well.\n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.7%, a decrease of 23 basis points. This decrease was driven by expenses that were lower as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, incentive compensation, hurricane-related disaster expenses and occupancy costs. These were partially offset by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, including utilities, repairs and maintenance and travel and training costs.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter increased 10.5% to $736 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 7.8%, a decrease of 4 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% and compares to 22.2% in the third quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the third quarter increased 12% to $2.33.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long-term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders.\n Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 34.8% overall and 28.4% on a per store basis.  Similar to the first half of the year, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories, primarily due to the continued rollout of our non-consumables' initiative, and the early receipt of seasonal goods.\n Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape, and we anticipate that we will begin to see lower levels of inventory growth beginning in Q4.\n Moving down the balance sheet. We issued $2.3 billion of senior notes during Q3, and we now expect to incur total interest expense of approximately $210 million for the full year, an increase of approximately $53 million over the prior year.\n Turning to cash flow. Year-to-date through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $1.2 billion, a decrease of 44%, primarily due to higher inventory purchases.\n Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock for $546 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $123 million. At the end of Q3, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion.\n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders, to anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.\n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. On year-to-date sales performance and our expectations for the remainder of Q4, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 full year expectations for net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week, and we are updating our expectation for same-store sales growth for Q4, which we expect same-store sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%, which would result in growth toward the upper end of our previous range of approximately 4% to 4.5%.\n Turning to gross margin. We've experienced many challenges over the course of this year, including those related to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics and the evolution of consumer spending. Since our last update and like many retailers, we have seen an increased headwind from lower-margin consumables, sales mix as customers face growing financial pressure. We expect this headwind to grow in Q4 as our guidance assumes customers continue to feel financial pressures and shift more of their spending to consumable items.\n And while we are making good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints, we expect some of the cost pressures we have experienced as a result of the delays will carry over into Q4, but will be largely resolved by Q1 of next year. Finally, we are seeing a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages than we anticipated for the back half of this year.\n Overall, while we are confident in the actions, we are taking to address our supply chain challenges, we anticipate the total headwind to gross margin in Q4 from all of these factors will be higher than what we previously contemplated within our financial guidance. With all this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance.\n For the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.30, which would result in a growth for the full year of approximately 7% to 8%. This is compared to our previous expectation of 12% to 14% EPS for the full year. Both the current and previous ranges include an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week. And our EPS outlook now assumes an effective tax rate toward the upper end of the previously provided range of 22% to 22.5%.\n We now expect capital spending for 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion, which is at the top end of our previously stated range. Finally, our expectations for share repurchases remain unchanged from what we stated in our Q2 earnings release on August 25, 2022.\n Overall, despite the near-term challenges, we are confident in the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we plan to share 2023 guidance on the Q4 call, we feel good about the sales momentum going into next year, coupled with moderating cost pressures.\n Let me provide some additional context as it relates to our Q4 outlook. As a reminder, we expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI through the remainder of the year. In addition, we expect the significant expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits going forward despite anticipated continued internal supply chain pressures in the near-term.\n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect these initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022, as we expect our benefits to gross margin will more than offset the associated SG&A expense.\n Consistent with Q2 and Q3, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, primarily toward incremental labor hours to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer experience.\n Finally, we also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track and are seeing savings in 2022, offsetting a portion of wage inflation. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long-term. We're working hard to address the near-term challenges, most of which we believe will be behind us as we enter 2023.\n Importantly, we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff. Sure, Matt. I'll start with the question around the supply chain costs. And as we called out versus previous expectations, the supply chain costs were a significant headwind more than $40 million above our previous expectations for Q3. And we do see this as near-term. And we're making very good progress toward resolving our storage capacity constraints as more capacity comes online.\n And we do believe some of these cost pressures, nonetheless, will carry over into Q4. However, we do expect this will largely be resolved in Q1 of next year. So as we look ahead, we anticipate supply chain costs, both internal and external in 2023 to be down quite a bit. We're obviously seeing it improving as others market for carrier costs as well. And so that as a potential tailwind going forward.\n And then LIFO as well. We're seeing the pace that while it will continue to pressure, Q4, we are seeing the pace of cost increases continue to moderate. And as we look at next year, we'd expect less pressure from LIFO. So certainly, some near-term pressures between LIFO between the supply chain cost.\n We also mentioned the sales mix shift and shrink and damages. But as we look to 2023 and beyond, we feel good about, as Jeff mentioned, one, the sales momentum in the business; but also moderating product cost and inflation, particularly around supply chain and LIFO.\n And as you look at the initiatives, we have that continue to contribute the other levers we have, not to mention our scale and where we're at in price, we don't see a need to invest. We feel that we're very well positioned as we look ahead to the future to continue expanding gross margin over the long-term. You asked about markdowns as well. I didn't want to miss that question. As you look at markdown risk, while up from the unusually low levels last year, markdowns are still well below pre-pandemic levels. If you look at the majority of the inventory growth, it's really driven by inflation.\n The team has done a good job anticipating the mix shift in consumer demand and has proactively been adjusting orders. And as a result, we feel very good about the quality of the inventory, ability to mitigate the markdown risk. As always, we've set aside, what we believe is an appropriate markdown level for the upcoming Christmas season. And of course, this is all reflected in our guidance. Sure. So as you mentioned, we won't be giving specific guidance on this call. We'll certainly share that on the March call. But I'll just start by reiterating that we feel great about the fundamentals of the business, the sales momentum, coupled with the moderating cost pressures that I just articulated. And as you called out, it is a 1 less week next year that's important to bear in mind.\n But again, as you look at the fundamentals of the business, they're very strong. We continue to see ourselves as 10% EPS growers over the long-term. Now we will always balance that with investing back in the business for the long-term, but feel we're very well positioned. And more to come for next year, but feel great about the momentum of the business fundamentals. So as you look at the drivers of the additional pressure on Q4, it's the same drivers as Q3, the order is a little bit different. As you look at what we anticipate as the key pressures on Q4 margins is still healthy flow-through, but less than previously expected.\n The big difference is, first the mix shift. We did see a mix shift in the consumables as customers face financial pressures. We want to go where the customer goes, and like the sales we're seeing, but it does pressure your margin a little bit with the mix of the sales.\n The other piece -- we did see -- we mentioned as we progressed through Q3 is a greater headwind from inventory shrink and damages. And that shrink can have a tail to that. Rest assured, the team knows how to deal with this and is taking actions to address it. But it does have a tail to it. And then while we are making good progress resolving our storage capacity constraints with the capacity online, we do believe, as we mentioned, that some of this will carry over into Q4, but be largely resolved by Q1.\n So that's the big versus our previous expectations. Obviously, the other big one is LIFO. As you look at LIFO, we called out $148 million in Q3, while we believe the product cost headwind is beginning to moderate. The prior cost increases will continue to pressure Q4 LIFO, and you could do the math as you do -- as you spread that across the year. So that's really the key drivers.\n But again, I'll just reiterate, many of these are transitory in nature. And as we look ahead to the future, we feel we're well positioned to resume growing our gross margin over the long-term with the initiatives, the levers, our scale and the pricing position we're in. Yes. And just -- echoing Jeff's comments, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. As he mentioned, we're above pro forma in sales, which puts us ahead of schedule in terms of the IRRs. Again, we target a 20% to 22% after-tax IRR based on the sales. And as we outperform in sales, that puts us a little ahead on the returns as well.\n And feel not only great about the -- and again, it's always important to bear in mind that it includes the impact of cannibalization, which is very minimal, has been very consistent, just given the localized nature of the shop. We continue to see paybacks less than 2 years.\n So it continues to be a fantastic investment that we continue to hit the gas on. And we're also really pleased with returns we get on our remodels as well, and we're doing not only a record number of overall projects this year, but a record number of remodels, which really helps drive the comp. No. No. Thank you, Michael. I'll try and tackle each of these. In terms of the carryover impact of the supply chain costs. We didn't give a specific number on that. It will be less, but still a meaningful impact to us.\n In terms of LIFO, the way to think about that is even though we don't anticipate -- we anticipate a slowdown in the number of price increases. The way you do that number is at a point in time, we project the full year impact of all the price increases we're aware of, and we spread that across the year. So that gets you in the game of what Q4 looks like. And as we look ahead to next year, it remains to be seen, but would anticipate a considerable reduction to that LIFO number.\n So as you look at -- as I mentioned, as you look ahead to next year, we think the supply chain costs will be down considerably because we won't have these near-term onetime costs, we don't anticipate because we think that will be resolved in Q1. And then the market is favorable in terms of just overall transportation costs, both foreign and domestic.\n And of course, we continue to stand up our private fleet, which we're going to -- every time we convert, we take 20% out and we're going to double that in size this year. So that's certainly a significant savings driver for us as well. And so as you look ahead to next year, I think it's safe to assume that there's a number of tailwinds.\n There's certainly some headwinds we mentioned. We'll have to wait and see what the mix does. We want to be there for the customer, and we'll go where she goes. So we have to see where that goes. As we said, shrink has a tail to it. And we're all over it. We know how to attack that, but it does have a bit of a tail.\n So as you look ahead to next year, there's some puts and takes. But again, we feel like there's a lot of tailwinds when you think of LIFO, when you think of the supply chain costs and all the other levers that we've talked about, not to mention the initiatives. Yes. I'll just reiterate, we see most of the pressures as transitory. When you look at the LIFO, when you look at the supply chain, we see that as transitory. We still feel very good about our nonconsumable products, and see this more as a transitory macro pressure.\n Again, we're growing share. We're just kind of following the market trend, which people are just shopping more toward consumables versus discretionary items. But we're taking share and feel that will certainly do very well there as the economy improves.\n And just structurally, we feel we're well positioned in terms of -- as we look at wages, we feel we're well positioned in terms of applicant flow and staffing levels. We feel we're investing appropriately in the business. We feel that our pricing is very appropriate.\n And again, I think it's important to mention that as you look at Q3, yes, we were down 27 basis points in gross margin, but we're still about 1 point above pre-pandemic levels despite all these transitory pressures I mentioned. We're still a point above where we were back in 2019 and Q3. Yes. So as we mentioned, we saw increased shrink later in Q3.

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our entire team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other.\n The quarter was highlighted by strong performance on the top line, led by comp sales growth of 6.8% and included increases in traffic and in market share of both consumable and nonconsumable product sales.\n During the quarter, we experienced significantly higher-than-anticipated cost pressures, including challenges within our internal supply chain, sales mix pressures and higher inventory damages and shrink, all of which impacted gross margin. We will elaborate more on these cost pressures in a bit.\n But despite these challenges, we delivered a double-digit increase in diluted earnings per share, along with strong same-store sales growth. As the economic environment continued to evolve during the quarter, we remain focused on serving the needs of our core customer.\n We continue to see customer behaviors in Q3 that we believe indicate they are feeling increased financial pressure, including reductions in the number of items purchased per basket and in discretionary spending, which was softer than anticipated during the quarter.\n Customers also continued to shift spending to more affordable options, such as items that are dollar price point and private brands, while also shopping closer to payday at the first of the month. Importantly, we are growing more productive with our core customer as well as seeing an increase in customers with annual household incomes up to $100,000.\n This growth underscores our belief that our value and convenience proposition resonates with a broad spectrum of customers and will continue to be important to all customers in this challenging economic environment. In turn, we remain focused on delivering value and convenience and continue to feel good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade.\n Further, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 price point, and we're pleased with the strong comp sales performance of these products during Q3, as they collectively outperformed the chain average. With nearly 19,000 stores, located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to support our customers even in a challenging economic environment.\n We're building on this foundation, I'm excited to share our real estate growth plans for next year. In fiscal 2023, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States including 1,050 new store openings as we continue to lay and strengthen the foundation for future growth. I'll share more details on these plans in just a few minutes, along with an update on our plans for our supply chain as we continue to support our significant growth.\n But first, let me recap some additional financial results for the third quarter. Our strong comp sales performance helped drive a net sales increase of 11.1% to $9.5 billion. From a monthly cadence perspective, the comp sales momentum we saw building in Q2 continued into all 3 months of Q3, with September being our strongest month of performance. And I'm pleased to note that Q4 sales are off to a strong start as well.\n Our Q3 comp sales were primarily driven by an increase in average transaction amount, largely driven by inflation. And as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment, average units per basket were down.\n As I mentioned earlier, we were excited to see a second consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic contribute to the growth. With regards to the supply chain cost pressures I mentioned earlier, I want to touch on what happened and the actions we have taken to address these challenges. As a reminder, since the early days of the pandemic over 2 years ago, we have seen demand and sales grow at a robust pace.\n In addition, the overall mix of products we are shipping has evolved significantly with the growth of our nonconsumable initiative in pOpshelf. As our distribution needs grew and evolved, we strategically designed permanent warehouse capacity solutions to support our growth.\n We plan for them to be operational starting in the back half of this year while making greater use of temporary storage facilities in the near-term. However, as we move through Q3, we experienced unexpected delays in opening additional temporary storage facilities, primarily due to external challenges such as permitting.\n At the same time, seasonal goods came in earlier than anticipated. The resulting constraints from these factors led to more than $40 million and additional supply chain costs in Q3 compared to what we had previously expected.\n These costs included retention fees incurred for delays in returning shipping containers. Costs associated with inefficiencies in moving freight within our distribution centers and higher transportation costs as a result of servicing stores from less-than-optimal distribution center alignments.\n While these issues have resulted in a gross margin headwind in the back half of this year, the team has worked hard to move past these delays with the opening of additional storage and warehouse facilities, which have already begun to relieve some of the capacity pressures.\n In fact, within the past few weeks, we increased capacity by more than 2 million square feet with the opening of 2 new permanent regional distribution hubs in Georgia and Texas, which will serve as intermediary facilities between import points and the rest of our distribution centers.\n With the opening of both the temporary and permanent facilities, we believe we are well positioned to drive continued improvement as we move ahead, as we better optimize store alignment with distribution centers, lower capacity utilization within our existing footprint and improve the overall flow of goods.\n Of note, these regional hubs will be followed by the opening of our new combination distribution center in Nebraska, which is scheduled to begin shipping by the end of this fiscal year. In addition, our previously announced facilities in Arkansas, Colorado and Oregon are expected to come online over the next 18 months.\n Collectively, all of these new distribution centers will ultimately result in a more than 20% increase in total capacity and position us well to support continued growth in the years to come.\n Overall, while internal supply chain challenges have impacted our EPS outlook for 2022, we believe the significant growth in demand that contributed to these challenges is a testament to the growing relevance of Dollar General. And we are confident in our plans to support this growth going forward.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives from a position of strength, as we continue to distance and differentiate Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape.\n We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And as a mature retailer in growth mode, our transformational strategic actions have positioned us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation.\n With that, I will turn the call over to John. Thank you, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.\n Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are continuing to make significant progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights.\n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 16,000 stores at the end of the third quarter. With over 75% of the assortment at $5 or less, this treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with customers who are seeking value. We continue to be pleased with the sales and margin performance we are seeing from our NCI offering, including market share growth in nonconsumable product categories.\n Looking ahead, we expect to realize ongoing benefits from this initiative throughout the remainder of the year and remain on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by year-end.\n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less.\n We recently celebrated the 2-year anniversary of the first pOpshelf store, along with our 100th store opening. And we are pleased to see the concept continuing to resonate with customers.\n During the quarter, we opened 23 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 103 located within 9 states. Additionally, we opened 15 new store-within-a-store concepts during Q3, bringing the total number of Dollar General market stores with a smaller footprint pOpshelf store included to a total of 40.\n We remain on track to nearly triple the stand-alone pOpshelf store count this year, which would bring us to a total of nearly 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations by year-end.\n Looking ahead, we plan to nearly double the pOpshelf store count next year, as our real estate plans for 2023 include opening approximately 150 additional locations, bringing the total number of pOpshelf stores to about 300 by the end of 2023. Overall, we remain excited about the pOpshelf concept and our goal of approximately 1,000 locations by year-end 2025.\n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas.\n As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing.\n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishable department.\n Going forward, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh, as we continue to optimize our network further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.\n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time.\n To that end, we offered Fresh produce in more than 3,000 stores at the end of Q3. And looking ahead, plan to add produce in approximately 2,000 stores in 2023, for a total of approximately 5,000 stores by the end of next year.\n Finally, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. During Q3, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022.\n Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead.\n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in more than 3,200 stores at the end of Q3, and we plan to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022.\n As we seek to further connect customers with our expanded health offering, we have recently launched a partnership with a third-party payment platform to allow customers to use health plan supplemental benefits to purchase various health and wellness-related items in their local Dollar General stores.\n And most recently, I'm excited to announce that we launched a pilot of a mobile health clinic provided by DocGo On-Demand to provide basic preventative and urgent care services at a small number of stores in Q3. We plan to test this offering in select stores over the next few months as we continue to work with customers on how to help bring affordable health and wellness closer to home, while further establishing Dollar General as a trusted health partner in the local community.\n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink and damage reduction.\n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business.\n In the third quarter, we completed a total of 798 real estate projects, including 268 new stores, 485 remodels and 45 relocations. For 2022, we now plan to execute approximately 2,945 real estate projects in total, including 1,025 new stores, 1,795 remodels and approximately 125 store relocations.\n Looking ahead, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to execute approximately 3,170 projects in the United States in 2023 across our Dollar General and pOpshelf banners, including 1,050 new stores, 2,000 remodels and 120 relocations.\n Our ability to innovate our store formats continues to be an important strength of the business, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our 2023 real estate strategy.\n Approximately 80% of our new stores and nearly all of our relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional box.\n With regards to remodels, approximately 80% will be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for a significant increase in cooler count as well as the ability to add Fresh produce in many stores.\n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and our goal is to open our first store in Mexico by the end of this fiscal year.\n As a reminder, these stores, which will be branded under the name [ MeSuper ] Dollar General will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico. Looking ahead, we plan to have up to 35 stores open in Mexico by the end of 2023, as we look to extend our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. These stores will be incremental to our planned 1,050 new store openings.\n As we head into 2023, our real estate pipeline remains robust. We see more than 16,000 total opportunities for small box retail stores in the United States, including more than 12,000 for Dollar General stores, approximately 3,000 for pOpshelf and approximately 1,000 for DGX. With these opportunities and our existing footprint of more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any other retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.\n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint, as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers.\n Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch for our customers, as we look to continue building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q3 with over 4.5 million monthly active users on the app, and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings.\n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of Q3, and we are very pleased with the year-to-date sales results.\n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest and participation from CPG companies and brands, who are seeking to connect with our more than 90 million unique profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the U.S.\n After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business. As we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business.\n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience. And we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties.\n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions.\n This approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience.\n The current focus of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. Self-checkout was available in more than 10,500 stores at the end of Q3, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates.\n We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staff register, if preferred.\n We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We are currently testing this layout in approximately 250 stores and are pleased with the early customer and associate response.\n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of 2022, as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail.\n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams.\n We also continue to reduce costs through the expansion of our private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,300 tractors at the end of Q3. As a reminder, we have been focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022, as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year.\n Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately, career advancement.\n Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by the more than 70% of our store employees at or above the lead sales associate position who were placed from within.\n In addition, approximately 15% of our growing private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We are pleased with our turnover trends and staffing levels. And applicant flow continues to be strong, further validating our confidence that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent.\n Ultimately, we believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique, competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\n We also recently completed our annual Community Giving Campaign, where our employees came together to raise funds for a variety of important causes. And I was once again inspired by the generosity and compassion of our people.\n We continue to add incredible talent across the organization in our stores, distribution centers, private fleet and at our store support center. As this new talent joins our tremendous team, I am continually reminded that the people of Dollar General are our greatest strength.\n In closing, I am excited about the future as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, with the number of initiatives we have in place and a unique and strong strategic planning process, we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth, while creating meaningful shareholder value.\n Finally, as we are in the midst of our busy holiday season, I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their commitment every day to serve our customers.  I am excited about our work together as we head into the final weeks of our year.\n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thanks, Matt. We are very pleased with our 6.8% comp sales increase. And as you mentioned, seeing traffic accelerate again for the second consecutive quarter was very nice to see, and also continuing to grow market share. We grew market share in our consumables and our nonconsumable business.\n And so when you think about that, our outperformance on sales really was driven in the consumables business, and it really is a testament to our going where the customer wants us to go. And that is something we've always done here at Dollar General. And I think it's a testament to the relevance of our box.\n When you think about our box and how we've continued to make it a fuller fill in shop, it really speaks to our ability to serve a broad spectrum of customers. And as you mentioned, with customers -- our core customer, one thing that is encouraging to see is she's still gainfully employed. And we've long said that is the single greatest factor in her economic health. So it's encouraging to see that, and it's encouraging to see us grow productivity and share with her.\n And also the encouraging thing we saw this quarter is we grew share in all income levels. And so that's particularly good to see when you think about the higher income levels. One of the things we've been very pleased at is our ability to retain that COVID customer higher than we expected to over the course of several quarters, and we continue to see that here. And we also saw us grow share and customers in the $100,000 income level.\n So when you step back and think about it, it again just points to our ability to serve multiple income cohorts. And that will set us up extremely well as we look to the future and our ability to not only make our core customer more productive, but also the ability to retain these new customers. So we feel real good about that.\n And as I mentioned around the consumable business, we're pleased with the performance there. And I think the thing to keep in mind, as you step back and you think about where Dollar General is today, our consumable business is a much different business from a profitability standpoint due to our strategic initiatives.\n When you think about NCI, our health offering, DG Fresh, it really has made that business a different business from a profitability standpoint. In fact, in the third quarter, our gross margin is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019, just to give you a little bit of color there.\n So again, we feel good about the top line. And as we look forward, we feel we're really well positioned to serve a multiple cohorts of customers in this economic environment. And I'd also say that we're excited to deliver more real estate projects in 2023 than we've ever done at Dollar General.\n And I think it's a testament to the robust pipeline and then also the strategic initiatives. So I feel real good about where we are from a sales standpoint and our position to be able to serve our broad customer base as we look forward. Corey, this is Jeff. Thank you for your question. And I'll start with the customer.\n I'll reiterate the fact that her gainfully being employed is, again, a very important factor to economic health. And so when we talk to our customers, and I feel like our teams do that better than just about anybody. What we hear is she's feeling the pressure of energy prices and fuel and just the everyday needs are -- it's hard to -- for her to make ends meet.\n And so she's behaving pretty much exactly the way we would expect her to in times like this. So what we're seeing from her is, as you alluded to, she's coming to us more often. She's buying fewer items on each occasion. And one of the things that we're very pleased is we're being able to help serve her needs through affordability. And our leaning into the dollar price point, our customer is responding incredibly well to that.\n And I just -- a testament to our team and to our ability to go where the customer wants us to around our $1 price point and affordability.\n But when you think about the consumable business, as you mentioned before, you got again, really step back and think about the strategic initiatives and how that has allowed us to really have a more profitable business there. And we've long used consumables to drive traffic and nonconsumables to build the basket.\n And so as we think about our -- excuse me, the nonconsumable, as you mentioned, certainly, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing on NCI, and its ability to really provide that value. When you think about NCI, 80% of the items are $5 or less.\n And so when you think about our ability to drive traffic through consumables, and then also see a little bit of our ability to rotate the product, the treasure hunt, our breadth strategy. We feel real good about our ability to help that customer continue to get the things they need and the things that they want.\n One last thing I'll say around private brand. I mean, we continue to be very pleased with what we're seeing on penetration. But the other thing you got to keep in mind is our customer, again, she's very brand-focused as well. And it's very important to her. And that's where it's important to really lean into our scale.\n As John mentioned earlier, the ability of Dollar General and a limited SKU retailer to be able to trade out brands, if necessary for our customer is a really, really powerful way for us to serve for better. And we've said this before, but our customer treats a brand as a brand. And so it gives us the ability to make sure that we're providing her with the value she needs. And our merchant team does that probably better than anybody in retail, in my view.\n So as you step back and think about it, we feel we're well positioned and really excited about our ability to continue to listen to our customer go where she wants us to go. And you combine that with the more profitable consumable business and our strategic initiatives and really set up nicely for us to continue to serve her, as we've done for many, many years in all economic cycles. Yes, Corey, I'll start and then I'll let John fill in on some of your questions around returns.\n But our real estate model continues to be a huge strength of this business. I mean the low-risk and high-return model is incredibly powerful. And when you think about the retail landscape today, when you think about some of the challenges other retailers have talked about on the real estate front, I'm just very, very excited and proud of the fact that we're going to deliver more projects than we ever have at Dollar General in 2023.\n And with 1,050 new stores, it continues to just highlight our ability to serve the customer and our ability through format innovation, our real estate model, our technology, we're able to go where the customer needs us to go. And so feel great about that. And really pleased at the fact, through format innovation, this larger store we're opening, our new store performance has been incredibly positive.\n And I'm very, very pleased at our ability to exceed our pro formas, and we continue to see that. So that larger store format is continuing to deliver higher sales per square foot, which is excited. And as you know, the large majority of our openings are in that larger footprint. But as you think about the next year in the future, I think the other thing that excites us here is the pipeline that we have.\n And on the U.S. alone, we have 16,000 additional opportunities, and we feel great about our ability to capture those. And certainly, our fair share, which we've certainly demonstrated, but 12,000 additional for DG, 3,000 for pOpshelf and then 1,000 for DGX. So stepping back, you can probably hear in my excitement about the real estate and our ability to continue to grow here. And we feel like we're being very prudent in this environment, I'm very, very pleased with the team's performance here.\n So I'll kick it over to John for your return question. Yes. Thanks. I'll tell you, as we said before, the delays of our temporary storage facilities, certainly, that unexpected delay did impact the quarter from a profitability standpoint. But again, I reiterate how pleased we were with the strong sales performance we saw. And the nice thing is like it normally is at DG, it's pretty broad-based. And so I think, again, that goes to the consistency of our ability to serve a customer across, not only a broad swath of the United States, but also around the income levels I mentioned earlier.\n And we're very pleased and excited that our temporary storage facilities are now online. We're also excited that our 2 new permanent regional hubs that are going to serve us extremely well. As we look to the future, they're also online. And of course, those things will take some time to get fully productive and to allow us to catch-up.\n So again, I would also mention we're pleased that we had in stock improvement year-over-year in Q3. So again, when you kind of bundle it all together, I think the team did a nice job of overcoming some of these challenges, to deliver for the customer, go where she wants us to go. I think that translated into our strong comp, our strong market share gains in both consumables and nonconsumables and a second consecutive quarter of sequential traffic increases.\n So again, feel pleased about the top line and feel pleased about where we have opened up our capacity. And finally, I'll just mention, as you look forward over the next 18 months, bringing on 4 permanent facilities, that will increase our capacity by 20%. And is something we factored into our strategic plan and feel great about how that's going to serve us well and allow us to continue to grow this business in the years ahead. Yes. Rupesh, as I said earlier, we're very pleased to be able to see that we're growing share in customers across all income levels. So that's encouraging. And really, again, I go back to the relevance of our brand of our box and our tremendous ability to listen and respond to what our customers are looking for.\n And certainly, I would tell you, the core customer is certainly behaving the way we expected her to. And also, as you think about it, one of the things that we continue to be pleased with is the fact that when we were introduced to that new customer during COVID, we continue to retain her at higher-than-expected levels.\n So I would say that as we sit here today, we feel real good about what we're seeing across all the income brackets. We feel real good about seeing the growth there. And I think we're very well positioned to continue to serve them.\n And I think if you step back and think about Dollar General, we're an all-weather brand, and we've been doing this for many, many years, and we continue to do that. And so -- and we will continue to do that. We'll go where the customer wants us to go, which we did this quarter.\n And we're also positioned to continue to do that as we move forward and continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives that really makes a more well-rounded shop and a greater appeal for a broad swath of customers. Well, thank you for all the questions and your continued interest in Dollar General.\n I just wanted to wrap up with 3 points. First, while we had some unanticipated challenges within our supply chain during the quarter, we're confident in the actions we've taken to address these near-term issues and expect continued improvement as we move through Q4 and into next year; second, we believe we are well positioned to keep growing market share, especially in an environment where customers are even more focused on value; and third, we believe our strong value and convenience proposition combined with our robust portfolio of strategic initiatives sets us up for a very long runway of growth.\n And we couldn't be more excited about where the future is headed. I want to thank you again for listening, and I hope you have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Robert, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Dollar General's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, August 25, 2022. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] \n Now I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Mr. Lau, you may begin the conference. \nDonny Lau: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; Jeff Owen, our COO; and John Garratt, our CFO.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call unless required by law. \n At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. \n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for delivering another quarter of strong performance and for their dedication to serving our customers, communities and each other. \n The quarter was highlighted by comp sales growth of 4.6%, a slight increase in customer traffic, accelerated growth in market share of highly consumable product sales, including in both dollars and units, and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Our Q2 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales in our consumable category. This increase was partially offset by a decline in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe reflects the evolving consumer demand during a period of inflation and economic uncertainty. \n During the quarter, and from a position of strength, we made targeted investments in both incremental labor hours and wages to further enhance the customer experience and build on our sales momentum. We believe these investments contributed to an improvement in our overall in-stock position and our strong sales results. And despite challenges from rising product cost inflation and ongoing supply chain pressures, our teams remain focused on controlling what we can control, while continuing to deliver value for our customers, which we believe is seen even more important in the current environment. \n To that end, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point, and we're pleased with the strong performance of this program during Q2, especially in the latter part of the quarter. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. And with more than 18,500 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment, while continuing, to support our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience. \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to strengthen our competitive position, while further distancing and differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $9.4 billion, compared to net sales of $8.7 billion in Q2 of 2021. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest, but positive in May, with July being our strongest month of performance, and I'm pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q3. In fact, as a result of our first half outperformance and strong start to Q3, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. \n Our Q2 results included an increase in average basket size, largely driven by inflation, as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment. Average units per basket were down, while, as I mentioned earlier, customer traffic increased slightly. \n As the quarter progressed, we saw additional signs of our core customers shopping more intentionally and closer to need, as well as an increase in trade down activity. For example, during Q2, customers appeared to be making trade-offs of some of their food choices, contributing to an increase in private brand penetration within our consumables business. We also saw growth in the number of higher-income households shopping with us, which we believe reflects more consumers choosing Dollar General as they seek value. \n Collectively, we view our Q2 results as further validation that our strategic actions, which have transformed this company in recent years, positions us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And given our strong competitive position, further enhanced by our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I have never felt better about the underlying business model or our future growth potential. \n With that said, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff Owen, who will officially take over as CEO in November. No one understands and embodies our culture more than Jeff, and his contributions to our strategic direction over the years have been instrumental to our success. I've had the pleasure of working with Jeff for many years, and I'm confident he is the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth here at Dollar General. \n And finally, while Jeff will speak more to this later, I also want to congratulate John Garratt on his well-deserved promotion to President and CFO. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, let me take a moment to thank Todd for his tremendous leadership and passion for our customers, our culture and this company. He has been a wonderful mentor and friend, and we wish him all the very best as he prepares to begin this new chapter. And let me also add my congratulations to Jeff, who I have known and worked closely with for several years. He is a highly respected leader throughout the organization, and we look forward to his leadership in the years ahead. \n Given Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me now take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. \n For Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.3%, an increase of 69 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory markups, partially offset by a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, as well as increases in markdowns, transportation costs, distribution costs and damages. Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $144 million during the quarter. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.6%, an increase of 82 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, repairs and maintenance, utilities and payroll taxes. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter increased 7.5% to $913 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.7%, a decrease of 13 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% and compares to 21.4% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted, EPS for the second quarter increased 10.8% to $2.98. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 31.4% overall and 25.1% on a per store basis. Similar to Q1, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories as a result of the continued rollout of our nonconsumables initiative. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. \n As Todd noted, we're also pleased with the improvements we saw in our in-stock levels during the quarter and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well-positioned to better serve our customers in the back half of the year. \n Year-to-date through Q2, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $948 million, a decrease of 28%. Total capital expenditures for the first half were $659 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $349 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $124 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion. We announced today that our Board has increased this authorization by $2 billion. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We continue to experience uncertainties with respect to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics, the evolution of consumer spending throughout the year, and most recently, new store opening delays, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. Despite these challenges, we are confident in the business, and as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022. For the full year, we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week and same-store sales growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. \n Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week, share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our EPS outlook also now assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we anticipate comp sales to be fairly consistent between Q3 and Q4, but EPS growth to be much higher in the fourth quarter, which includes the anticipated benefit from the 53rd week. In addition, we expect share repurchases in Q3 to be slightly higher than the Q2 amount before increasing more substantially in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fourth quarter. Finally, as a result of an increase in interest rates and additional borrowings, we expect interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year. \n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including continued expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits despite anticipated and continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected continuation of sales mix pressure, as well as sales outperformance as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. \n We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will continue to offset a portion of expected wage inflation. Finally, and consistent with Q2, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours and wages to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. \n In summary, we are proud of our team's hard work and commitment to execution, which has resulted in our strong second quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you, John. Let me take a moment to express my appreciation for all Todd has done for this company throughout his 14-year career. He's led us through a transformational period and has positioned us extremely well for the future. On behalf of the entire Dollar General team, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact he has made on our business. I am fortunate to have been able to learn from him, and I look forward to his ongoing counsel. \n And as Todd noted, we are excited to announce that John has been promoted to President, while continuing to serve as CFO. John has made many significant contributions to Dollar General during his time leading our finance and corporate strategy teams, and I look forward to his continued leadership and partnership as he steps into this new role. \n Finally, let me also say how humbled and privileged I am by the opportunity to serve this great team as the next CEO of Dollar General. I couldn't be more excited about our future and all that we can accomplish together. \n Now let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to create opportunities for meaningful growth. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We continue to make progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in nearly 15,000 stores at the end of the second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. This treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with value-seeking customers as approximately 80% of the assortment is priced at $5 or less. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. \n During the quarter, we opened 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 80, located within 8 states. Additionally, we opened 7 new store-within-a-store concept during the second quarter. This brings the total number of Dollar General market stores, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store to a total of 32 at the end of the quarter. We plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, and now expect to open a total of 15 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to about 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and approximately 40 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. \n Over the long term, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for these stores to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate to exceed 40%. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021, and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are also pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n And while produce was not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. Notably, at the end of Q2, we offered produce in more than 2,700 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. Finally, as I previously mentioned, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. \n During Q2, we added over 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in approximately 2,700 stores at the end of Q2, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n During the quarter, we announced the establishment of a new Healthcare Advisory Panel, which recently convened its first quarterly meeting. The panel is composed of highly regarded health care industry subject matter experts who will serve as thought partners to our team, including advising on how best to invest resources to better serve our customers in the health and wellness space. \n Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n To that end, we recently announced plans to significantly increase our supply chain capacity by building 3 new distribution centers in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Aurora, Colorado; and Salem, Oregon. Each facility will be approximately 1 million square feet and supported in part by our growing private fleet. We expect to begin construction on the Arkansas and Oregon facilities this fall, with both of which will be combo traditional and fresh distribution centers. We have already begun construction on the Colorado facility, which will be a traditional dry goods distribution center. We are excited about these new projects, which we expect will add more than 1,000 new jobs supporting our ongoing store growth and drive additional efficiencies in our supply chain. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 790 real estate projects, including 227 new stores, 533 remodels and 30 relocations. For 2022, we are updating our real estate plans to reflect adjustments made primarily in response to ongoing delays related to permitting and the receipt of construction materials associated with the new store openings. For 2022, we now plan to execute in the range of 2,930 to 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,010 to 1,060 new stores, approximately 1,795 remodels and about 125 store relocations. \n We continue to expect approximately 80% of our new Dollar General stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format, which allows us for an even greater assortment as we look to serve our customers with products they want and need. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format, highlighted by increased sales productivity, and we continue to target returns in the range of 20% to 22%. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and we continue to make good progress towards our goal of opening our first stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. \n I am pleased to announce that these stores will be branded under the name [ The Super ] Dollar General, which resonated well with customer focus groups and connotes the idea of a local general store focused on serving customers with products they want and need most. In addition, the initial stores will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico as we look to initially leverage our brand awareness, while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. And with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch to our stores as we look to create deeper and more meaningful connections with our customers. We ended Q2 with nearly 4.5 million monthly active users on the digital app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery and an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the results, including sales above our initial expectations for the first half of the year. \n In addition, we are also excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest in participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with the more than 80 million unique customer profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country and allude the reach of other retail media networks. As a result, we are enabling advertisers to both digitally and physically build awareness and drive purchase consideration, while positioning Dollar General as a retailer of choice for customers seeking many of America's most trusted brands. \n After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business, as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. \n Self-checkout was available in approximately 10,000 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. \n We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staffed register preferred. We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores by the end of this year. \n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative retail and small box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams. Our efforts to reduce costs have also benefited from our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,100 tractors at the end of Q2. \n As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development, and ultimately, career advancement. To that end, we are very pleased with our DG Discover Hiring event in Q2, which exceeded our goal for new hires, while adding significant talent to our teams in the field, distribution centers and private fleet. \n With regards to development, our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We also continue to be pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. Ultimately, we believe that the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month in Nashville, providing an important collaboration and development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This event is a high point for me every year, and I am always inspired by the incredible talent of our people and humbled by the way they live out their personal purpose, while fulfilling our mission to serve others. \n In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their work every day to make a difference in the lives of our customers, especially at times like this when they need us the most. I am excited about all that we will accomplish together in the second half of 2022 and beyond. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So first, Todd, congrats on all the success over the years. And Jeff and John, congrats on your well-deserved promotions. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you. \nJeffery Owen: Thank you. \nRupesh Parikh: So I was hoping to first touch just on your price position. So how do you feel about your pricing position today in light of some of the competitive actions that are taking place right now and are expected to happen going forward? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Rupesh, this is Todd. I'll take that one. We feel great about our price position. I just want to remind everybody, well over a year ago, we took a very aggressive price stance, as you may recall me talking about over the last 18 months or so. And it positions us so well in the pandemic and now exiting the pandemic time frame. And we feel great about where we are on prices against all classes of trade, and of course, against even our chief competitors, we're in really good shape. And obviously, as we continue to move forward with this environment, we'll continue to look at how we service our customer. \n The fabulous thing is we're in a great position, and our customers are really showing through our increase in trips that we saw for the quarter that they rely on our everyday low price here at Dollar General always first before anything else. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then my 1 follow-up question, maybe for John. So there was pretty significant deleverage on more than 4% comp. So anything unusual to happen in Q2 that doesn't repeat for the back half of the year? And then just any more color in terms of how to think about SG&A for the back half. \nJohn Garratt: Thanks, Rupesh. As you look at SG&A, nothing unusual there. One thing we had talked about was from a position of strength and given the sales outperformance and momentum that we were going to be making targeted proactive investments to build on that momentum, to help drive sales, as well as an enhanced customer experience. So really, it was consistent with that. \n The most notable one was adding some labor hours to help further improve our in-stock levels as well as that customer service. We really like what we're seeing there. Also, to a lesser extent, we did make targeted investments in wages in the physical box itself. But I would say more normal course proactive actions to drive the business. We also did see some inflation on utilities and did have some higher-than-normal R&M expenses associated with the weather. But I think when you look at just overall operating margin, we feel really good about what we're doing. \n We feel great about the gross margin expansion. A lot of the investments we make in SG&A really drives that gross margin expansion, which was up 69 basis for the quarter, and importantly, 1.5 points above where we were 3 years ago. So we really like to look at operating profit overall because, as we said before, the geography and the leverage changes a little bit as we spend a little bit on SG&A to drive more on gross margin as you look at the implied guidance with the sales and the strong bottom line guide for the year, that implies operating margin expansion over the back half. So we feel well positioned that we're making the right trade-offs and investments to drive that sales growth. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on another great quarter, guys. So first, could you just speak to the top line acceleration that you're seeing despite the tougher backdrop for low-income households that, I think, broadly, we're seeing. How best to think about the inflection back to positive traffic that you saw this quarter? And what are you seeing from retention of new customers that you've recently acquired? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Yes, I would tell you that as expected, the customer is reacting just like we thought she would. And that is she's shopping closer to need. She's being very intentional in her shopping patterns, as well as her shopping while she's inside the 4 walls of the Dollar General store. It is a little bit more skewed to need based, which we thought would also occur. But the great thing is what we're seeing is that if we do have the right product out there, which we do, on the discretionary side, she's shopping that as well. As an example, our harvest in Halloween is off to a fabulous start, well over what we expected. \n So again, you got to have the right items at the right value, and that's what Dollar General is all about as you know. With that more intentional shopping, we also see her buying more private brands. So our private brand sales have continued to increase quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year. And so we're seeing that. And then the all-important $1 price point. By the way, the $1 price point was one of, if not, the fastest-growing subcategory we had here at Dollar General in Q2. And we're seeing that it is so much more important for her today than ever before to be able to feed her family toward the end of the month. \n So we're definitely leaning in both in private brand and the $1 price point. You may remember, I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, that we anticipated this, so we started to bring in more of this type of product, as well as our merchants under Emily Taylor and her group to really highlight that in off-shelf displays, end caps and that has been ongoing. And we'll continue to press forward on that as we move to the back half of the year because, again, we believe that $1 price point will be very, very important. \n And then lastly, just like we thought, again, trips being up, so she's coming more often, but spending less on each trip. And again, that's a reversal to what we saw there in the pandemic. So she's really coming back to where we suspected she would. But the great thing about Dollar General is our price is fabulous. Our price position, as I mentioned earlier, couldn't be better, and she's showing it within those trips that she's bringing to Dollar General. So more to come as we move through the back half of this year and into '23. But I would tell you, I've never felt better about our positioning as we are here to help that customer through probably the toughest time she's seen in quite a while. \nMatthew Boss: That's great. And then maybe, John, on gross margin. How best to think about the components in the back half if we're thinking about mark on LIFO or mix? And then just larger picture, holding the earnings guide today despite the better sales outlook, so is this solely the targeted investments that you cited that's holding back incremental model flow through? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. I'll start with gross margin. We didn't give specific guidance on gross margin. But to give you some color around the puts and the takes, we do expect to continue to see mixed pressure over the course of the remainder of the year as sales outperformance exceeds -- on consumables, exceeds nonconsumables, as everybody is seeing. And we also do expect to see ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, as well as increased product cost inflation. So we expect that to continue. \n But I would tell you, on the transportation side and supply chain in general, we are seeing moderation there, and we do get an easier lap in the back half as we lap pretty substantial and growing supply chain inflation last year. And we're doing a lot of good things to help mitigate that. As Jeff mentioned in the prepared comments, doubling the size of the private fleet, really has a meaningful impact on that where we save about 20% on a per driver basis there. \n The other thing we called out was markdowns, but I would tell you, with the markdowns, that's really a function of normalization. We were lapping unusually low clearance markdowns and promotional markdowns last year. If you look at where we're at now, still well below pre-pandemic levels, but that lap will continue to be a bit of a pressure to us. \n But as we look at the back half of the year, in addition to the easing inflationary pressures, particularly on the supply chain and some other areas and the actions we're taking, we're continuing to see growing benefits from our strategic initiatives, which go after the top line and the bottom line other actions to help mitigate that. And as I mentioned previously, when you look at operating margin overall, it suggests expansion in the back half given all the actions we're taking. \n So -- and as we look ahead, I think we're very well positioned to continue to expand our gross margin over the long term. Todd talked about being in a great spot on price position. And again, as a limited SKU operator with our growth in size, I think it really positions us well in this environment to serve that customer very well. Be sharp on price, but to continue to expand our margins over the long term. \n And in terms of the question around why not raise EPS guidance, I would say that, first, very pleased based on the strength of the first half of the year and the anticipated results in the back half to raise the sales guidance, and pleased to reiterate the strong EPS guidance, while others have had to lower it in this challenging environment. We see the business fundamentals is very strong. It positions us very well to continue to be double-digit EPS growers over the long term, which we were at 10.8% this quarter. \n But there are some near-term headwinds. We mentioned the ongoing mix pressure. The overperformance in sales has been on the consumables side, which has lower margins. And while we do expect some moderation in inflation in the near term, it remains pressured with elevated supply chain costs, fuel costs and product cost inflation, of course, the LIFO charge, which continues throughout the year as that's spread over the year. \n Also another piece which you mentioned is the SG&A investment, which I talked about. I wouldn't say that's the only driver, the primary driver. But that is a driver to that. But again, we like what we're seeing there in terms of the investment in labor hours to help drive a better customer experience, to help drive sales and we are investing, as I mentioned, a little bit in targeted investments in wages in the box itself. \n And then the other thing we called out was interest. Interest will be higher in the back half of the year given higher interest rates and higher borrowings. So a number of near-term tailwinds, but we feel really good to be able to maintain that guidance, continue to see ourselves as double-digit EPS growers over the long term. And there's a lot of year left, but feel good about the guidance we've provided. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats again, best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Probing a bit on the sales guidance for the back half, I recognize that the 1-year comp is guided to accelerate. If we look at the 3-year stack, it looks like Q2 accelerated quite a bit and that the second half actually doesn't imply much of an acceleration. So curious given the trade down and, I guess, where the customer is going, seems to benefit you right now. Any assumptions other than conservatism that you're thinking about in terms of sales for the second half? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. As you look at sales in the second half, I mean, when you do the squeeze on that, that's quite healthy sales, not only on a 3-year basis, but as you look at the 1-year basis. To your point, we did see accelerating comps, we saw accelerating comps throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the momentum of the business going in. We feel really good about the new customers and basket size growth that we've been able to retain coming out of the pandemic. And we are starting to see signs of more customer trade down, that's contemplated in the guidance. I wouldn't say we have a significant impact from that built into the guidance. But based on what we're seeing, that is contemplated in there. We're seeing a bigger impact, as big as ever impact from our real estate with the strong performance of remodels and new units, which are exceeding our pro forma, and the initiatives are delivering. So we feel really good about where we're at, the momentum of the business, the fundamentals, and I think the guidance reflects that, as well as a little bit in there contemplated around that trade down. \nSimeon Gutman: And maybe the follow-up, just honing on the gross margin a bit. Q2 was quite good and at a structurally higher level. Can you talk about the sustainability of this? And if there was some -- maybe some puts in and takes, but it feels like we're run rating at a higher level, and not thinking about guidance into '23, but are the drivers actually accelerating? You mentioned some relief on input costs. Are the drivers accelerating such that this is only going to build from here? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. Again, I don't want to get too specific around gross margin guidance. But again, as you do the squeeze in the back half, it implies healthy, positive operating margin expansion and gross margin. We feel good about where we're at here in terms of sustainability over the long term to drive that. The biggest driver when you look, again, you go back to pre-pandemic levels where we're up 1.5 points in this quarter. It's the initiative is a huge piece of that. The ongoing benefit of DG Fresh and NCI, as we optimize and scale those, that's the gift that keeps on giving other things around the DG Media Network, just while promotional activity was a little bit higher versus pandemic where there was none. We remain very targeted in that and are doing a great job minimizing the clearance activity. \n So I think as you think the fundamental drivers of the initiatives, as you think about the other levers we've talked about, the efficiencies we're driving in supply chain, including the private fleet and the other levers we've talked about. And we do see spots where the inflation is starting to moderate, particularly around carrier rates ocean freight, we're seeing moderation there. It remains to be seen what happens to inflation overall with vendors, but we'd expect over time that growth, that pace of increases to start to moderate as well. \n And again, as you get to the back half of the year, we're lapping pretty substantial increasing supply chain inflationary laps. And so as we see some moderation and get easing laps, that will help as well. And that's all contemplated in the guide. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Todd, Jeff and John, congratulations on all your new endeavors. My first question is the success of Dollar General over many years has been driven by not only a superior execution and formal strategy, but also some of its competitors in the small-box value retail space being on a long journey to try and find their way. And now there could be some changes in the competitive environment. We're seeing Family Dollar make price investments, it could be the perception that you're making investments in store hours, store labor as another way to beef up in the event that you are now going to face a stronger competitor, so the net result of all this could mean that the profit rate, the operating profit rate in small box retail has peaked as now 2 competitors that are going to be stronger and well positioned, are fighting a little bit harder against each other. Why or why not is that the case? \nTodd Vasos: I'll start it out, Michael. I would tell you that obviously, you're zeroing in on our chief competitor there. So I'll just say this that it's been not only a long journey for them, I would say it's been even tougher than that. We've heard over the last 7 years that they're getting traction and they're doing this and doing that, and we're still talking about that. So I think we're still talking about it. \n What we are here to do, as you know us pretty well, Michael, is controlling what we can control and forging ahead on our initiatives. We have left our chief competitor completely in the dust that will take years, years to catch up. And I would also tell you that we feel very, very strongly that peak margins haven't yet been obtained and that we have a lot of room to grow. You've heard from John, not only short term but long term. \n Our initiatives alone are driving a tremendous amount of that growth and that confidence. And I would tell you that Jeff and the team, as we go forward, have got a lot of initiatives in the hopper that we haven't even talked about yet that are percolating. So we're looking out as we promised everyone 6 years ago, when we started the strategic journey that we've been on, that we would look out 5 to 10 years down the road and around the corner. And I think you've seen from us that we've done that. And I think you've seen the fruits of that as we continue to roll out these initiatives. \n And to your point, have some of the best execution in the retail industry against initiatives. Lastly, being here for 14 years and thinking back to the last time we had the recession and we had the customer that was really strained, the 1 thing that Dollar General had is that we had already fixed a lot of the basic railroad by the time we really hit stride in late '09 and '10. I would hate to be trying to fix the railroad right now. It would be like one of the toughest times to do it. And so I would like to just point out that we're in such a great position that as we continue to move forward, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on that trade down that we're already seeing. And that trade down is coming from income levels that are upwards of $100,000 which we really are encouraged in seeing a younger consumer, a little bit more affluent, and again, very digitally and tech savvy. \nMichael Lasser: Super helpful. My follow-up question is on the outlook for this trade down. Your comp in the quarter was obviously well above your algorithm, you're guiding conservatively for the back half of the year seemingly so. You have a lot of inventory. Why wouldn't this above algorithm comp continue well into next year, assuming that the macro environment stays where it is, and if it gets a little worse that trade-down benefit will be even greater? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. So I would tell you that I will first start and just say that we feel that, that trade down will continue to come in and benefit us. As it relates to the inventory levels, we couldn't be happier with where we sit today on inventory. We did all the right things early on, Michael, as you would imagine, coming from a Dollar General. We were well ahead of any inventory issues that may pop up unlike some of our competitors out there. We canceled orders as early as December because we saw where the customer was headed. We actually have canceled orders not only into Q2, but into the back half of the year. And all of our guidance is contemplated on that. So we feel very strong. The quality of our inventory couldn't be better. And as we move forward, we believe that will benefit us as we move into the back half of this year and into next year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I just wanted to go back on the trade down commentary. If there are certain categories being sought out by the higher-end consumer. And what categories are you seeing heavier trade down to with regards to private label? And then just as a follow-up, with the higher-end consumer coming into the store now, how long do they traditionally stick around and how might you be trying to keep them as more permanent customers? \nTodd Vasos: I would tell you, what we're seeing on that higher-end consumer is that she does shop a more holistic part of the store. And I made mention on the harvest and Halloween as an example, very discretionary, but doing extremely well. And some of that comes from that trade down, right? Because that consumer does have a little bit more money to spend. And as you think about how sticky that customer is, well, dial the clock back just a bit to the pandemic and now coming out of the pandemic, we've retained a lot more of those customers than we thought we would. So we're very happy on that retention. So we know that they're sticky because, again, that consumer -- was that consumer making -- the majority of them making that 50 to 75 range. So this one extends up to 100. But again, the experience is very, very similar to those, for those consumers when they come in. So we believe that, that will be sticky as well. \n So when you think about our market share in just discretionary items. I also want to point out that, that was positive as well for the quarter. So we're picking up share even in a very tough environment on the discretionary side. \n And then lastly, your other question was around what type of items are we seeing as well. Even from our core customer, trading down -- trade down doesn't always mean just trading down from other retailers. It also is trading down when you get inside the box, and our core customer has been buying more private brands, that $1 price point, very, very important to her. If you think about things that have accelerated greatly over the last quarter, if you think of basic proteins that our core customer needs, so what we've seen is 15% to 20% increases over the last couple of quarters in canned meat, seafood, dry pasta, soups, rice and beans. So those core proteins, eggs, all those things that the consumer needs to feed her family but can do it at a much reduced price. So we're seeing that trade down effect as well, and we're in great position to take advantage of that, both from our everyday low retail price stance, as well as our supply chain is much more healthier there than we were last year at this time. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Congratulations. Todd, I wonder if you can talk to, you referenced this strategic journey, which is one of the most significant things I think you brought in. Where are we on that in terms of the pipeline of things? Well, First of all, I think you're looking out, right, 2 or 3 years with that effort. Where is the pipeline versus where it's been historically, right? Is it fuller? And then where do you think -- you're not going to talk specifics, but when you think about kind of functional areas, right, merchandising, marketing, where do you think there's the most fertile ground, right, to use those strategic ideas to further the DG brand? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Let me start, and I'm going to turn it over to Jeff as well. But I would tell you that, John, we feel great about those strategic initiatives. And to your point, not only a couple of years out, but 5 and 10 years out is the look. And if you look at the majority of them, there -- for instance, NCI, as an example, while we're close to the end of that rollout journey, the next phase of that, that optimization phase, is just starting. I would tell you, we're probably in the fifth inning in NCI. We're in the late fourth inning in the fresh piece of the business, with produce being a big unlock yet to come as an example. And then we're just starting the journey. We're just getting up to the plate to use the analogy in both Mexico and in our health initiative. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got others we haven't even talked about ready to push into the pipeline. And Jeff, you may want to jump in just briefly. \nJeffery Owen: Yes. I would tell you, John, thank you for the question. And I think, we've never been more excited about the future. And to Todd's point earlier, it's not 2 to 3 years out. I mean, one of the things you got to think about is our, first of all, our pipeline for growth. I mean, that 17,000 additional opportunities, 13,000 general stores, 3,000 pOpshelf stores and 1,000 DGX. So First and foremost, our pipeline is extremely robust, and we're very pleased with this larger store format that we've been rolling out. 80% of our stores this year will be in that larger store format, and we're seeing the sales per square foot perform extremely well. So we're very pleased at how our new store performance is beating our pro forma expectations. \n And John, you've followed us for quite some time. We have pretty high expectations for our new store growth program. But as you think to the future also, you got to think about digital as well. I mean, our digital strategy and our acceleration there is serving us tremendously well. \n I mean, when you think about over 80 million profiles that we're able to connect with our CPG firms and our brand partners, and we believe we can expand that beyond traditional CPG and brand partners because we have a unique customer, almost 30% of the United States population in rural America, that's really hard to reach. And with our customer profiles, we're able to really connect multiple partners with that unique Dollar General customer that no one knows better than we do. \n But as you think down the road, Mexico, we're excited to open stores, and we said this before, we wouldn't be going to Mexico if we didn't think it was a huge opportunity. And then when you think about health, health is one of these where we're -- we just had our first meeting with our advisory panel. It was incredible. And you're going to hear a lot more about health here in the near term and in the future with our Chief Medical Officer, Albert Wu, his strategy and the way we're going to be able to provide access for a customer that's being underserved right now. \n So when you think down the road, it's extremely bright. And I would tell you, your comment about our teams, where do we have fertile ground? We have the best team in retail. And so when you look at every aspect of this Dollar General team, it's the unique and secret sauce of our success. And our culture has never been stronger. Our teams are energized to continue to move forward. So I think you can tell from my excitement, Todd's excitement, John's, that we see tremendous opportunity in the future. And I can't wait to update you guys in the near future on where we're going. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Congrats to Todd on a successful career with Dollar General, and to Jeff and John for your new elevated roles. So first, there was an announcement intra-quarter about the 3 DC openings out west. Are we to read into that, that there are perhaps the more incremental store opportunity ahead lies in the regions where those new DCs are, in fact, being built out west in the U.S.? \nJeffery Owen: Corey, thank you for the question, and thank you for the well wishes. One of the things we do so well here at Dollar General is we anticipate and look down the road. And we like to think we look around the corner real well, too. So that's exactly what this is. Our distribution strategy is in lockstep, as I mentioned just a minute ago. We have 17,000 additional opportunities, and that's across the entire U.S. And so we're very pleased at our ability to expand our distribution network because what it's going to do for us is it's going to continue to allow us to serve our stores better, make it more efficient, be able to pull cost out of the system and enable us to continue to grow. And as you can tell, we have significant growth prospects in the future. And that's all this is, is being able to make sure that our distribution is in line with our store opening plans, and those 2 teams work very, very well together to plan accordingly. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. And then just a follow-up for John. How are you thinking about your expectations for freight expenses throughout the back half of this year within the overall margin guidance that you've given? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. As we touched on earlier, we do see improving conditions there. You're seeing additional supply capacity come online. You're seeing, obviously, demand drop as folks cut orders. And so when you look at both ocean freight and you look at domestic carrier rates, we're seeing those rates come down. And again, actions we're taking like with the private fleet is helping mitigate that as well. And we're coming up on a time where you're lapping increasing supply chain costs as you went from Q3 into Q4 last year. So I think net-net, we're doing a great job mitigating it. And I think that will, over time, switch to a tailwind as we see that moderate. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. And I do appreciate all the well wishes that you extended. \n Serving what this team has been the highlight of my professional career, and it's been a blessing and a privilege to serve our customers, associates, shareholders and communities over the past 7-plus years as the CEO of Dollar General. I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made together, and look forward to working with Jeff and the team in an advisory and consulting capacity going forward, as well as continue to serve on the board. I believe we have the best team in retail, our mission and culture are stronger than ever and we are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see ahead. \n Again, thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results, and I want to thank our associates for delivering another quarter of strong performance and for their dedication to serving our customers, communities and each other. \n The quarter was highlighted by comp sales growth of 4.6%, a slight increase in customer traffic, accelerated growth in market share of highly consumable product sales, including in both dollars and units, and double-digit growth in diluted EPS. Our Q2 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales in our consumable category. This increase was partially offset by a decline in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe reflects the evolving consumer demand during a period of inflation and economic uncertainty. \n During the quarter, and from a position of strength, we made targeted investments in both incremental labor hours and wages to further enhance the customer experience and build on our sales momentum. We believe these investments contributed to an improvement in our overall in-stock position and our strong sales results. And despite challenges from rising product cost inflation and ongoing supply chain pressures, our teams remain focused on controlling what we can control, while continuing to deliver value for our customers, which we believe is seen even more important in the current environment. \n To that end, we remain committed to offering products at the $1 or less price point, and we're pleased with the strong performance of this program during Q2, especially in the latter part of the quarter. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. And with more than 18,500 stores located within 5 miles about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment, while continuing, to support our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience. \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we look to strengthen our competitive position, while further distancing and differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $9.4 billion, compared to net sales of $8.7 billion in Q2 of 2021. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were lowest, but positive in May, with July being our strongest month of performance, and I'm pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q3. In fact, as a result of our first half outperformance and strong start to Q3, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. \n Our Q2 results included an increase in average basket size, largely driven by inflation, as we would expect during a more challenging economic environment. Average units per basket were down, while, as I mentioned earlier, customer traffic increased slightly. \n As the quarter progressed, we saw additional signs of our core customers shopping more intentionally and closer to need, as well as an increase in trade down activity. For example, during Q2, customers appeared to be making trade-offs of some of their food choices, contributing to an increase in private brand penetration within our consumables business. We also saw growth in the number of higher-income households shopping with us, which we believe reflects more consumers choosing Dollar General as they seek value. \n Collectively, we view our Q2 results as further validation that our strategic actions, which have transformed this company in recent years, positions us well for continued success, while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And given our strong competitive position, further enhanced by our robust portfolio of short- and long-term initiatives, I have never felt better about the underlying business model or our future growth potential. \n With that said, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff Owen, who will officially take over as CEO in November. No one understands and embodies our culture more than Jeff, and his contributions to our strategic direction over the years have been instrumental to our success. I've had the pleasure of working with Jeff for many years, and I'm confident he is the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth here at Dollar General. \n And finally, while Jeff will speak more to this later, I also want to congratulate John Garratt on his well-deserved promotion to President and CFO. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to John. Yes. Rupesh, this is Todd. I'll take that one. We feel great about our price position. I just want to remind everybody, well over a year ago, we took a very aggressive price stance, as you may recall me talking about over the last 18 months or so. And it positions us so well in the pandemic and now exiting the pandemic time frame. And we feel great about where we are on prices against all classes of trade, and of course, against even our chief competitors, we're in really good shape. And obviously, as we continue to move forward with this environment, we'll continue to look at how we service our customer. \n The fabulous thing is we're in a great position, and our customers are really showing through our increase in trips that we saw for the quarter that they rely on our everyday low price here at Dollar General always first before anything else. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Yes, I would tell you that as expected, the customer is reacting just like we thought she would. And that is she's shopping closer to need. She's being very intentional in her shopping patterns, as well as her shopping while she's inside the 4 walls of the Dollar General store. It is a little bit more skewed to need based, which we thought would also occur. But the great thing is what we're seeing is that if we do have the right product out there, which we do, on the discretionary side, she's shopping that as well. As an example, our harvest in Halloween is off to a fabulous start, well over what we expected. \n So again, you got to have the right items at the right value, and that's what Dollar General is all about as you know. With that more intentional shopping, we also see her buying more private brands. So our private brand sales have continued to increase quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year. And so we're seeing that. And then the all-important $1 price point. By the way, the $1 price point was one of, if not, the fastest-growing subcategory we had here at Dollar General in Q2. And we're seeing that it is so much more important for her today than ever before to be able to feed her family toward the end of the month. \n So we're definitely leaning in both in private brand and the $1 price point. You may remember, I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, that we anticipated this, so we started to bring in more of this type of product, as well as our merchants under Emily Taylor and her group to really highlight that in off-shelf displays, end caps and that has been ongoing. And we'll continue to press forward on that as we move to the back half of the year because, again, we believe that $1 price point will be very, very important. \n And then lastly, just like we thought, again, trips being up, so she's coming more often, but spending less on each trip. And again, that's a reversal to what we saw there in the pandemic. So she's really coming back to where we suspected she would. But the great thing about Dollar General is our price is fabulous. Our price position, as I mentioned earlier, couldn't be better, and she's showing it within those trips that she's bringing to Dollar General. So more to come as we move through the back half of this year and into '23. But I would tell you, I've never felt better about our positioning as we are here to help that customer through probably the toughest time she's seen in quite a while. I'll start it out, Michael. I would tell you that obviously, you're zeroing in on our chief competitor there. So I'll just say this that it's been not only a long journey for them, I would say it's been even tougher than that. We've heard over the last 7 years that they're getting traction and they're doing this and doing that, and we're still talking about that. So I think we're still talking about it. \n What we are here to do, as you know us pretty well, Michael, is controlling what we can control and forging ahead on our initiatives. We have left our chief competitor completely in the dust that will take years, years to catch up. And I would also tell you that we feel very, very strongly that peak margins haven't yet been obtained and that we have a lot of room to grow. You've heard from John, not only short term but long term. \n Our initiatives alone are driving a tremendous amount of that growth and that confidence. And I would tell you that Jeff and the team, as we go forward, have got a lot of initiatives in the hopper that we haven't even talked about yet that are percolating. So we're looking out as we promised everyone 6 years ago, when we started the strategic journey that we've been on, that we would look out 5 to 10 years down the road and around the corner. And I think you've seen from us that we've done that. And I think you've seen the fruits of that as we continue to roll out these initiatives. \n And to your point, have some of the best execution in the retail industry against initiatives. Lastly, being here for 14 years and thinking back to the last time we had the recession and we had the customer that was really strained, the 1 thing that Dollar General had is that we had already fixed a lot of the basic railroad by the time we really hit stride in late '09 and '10. I would hate to be trying to fix the railroad right now. It would be like one of the toughest times to do it. And so I would like to just point out that we're in such a great position that as we continue to move forward, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on that trade down that we're already seeing. And that trade down is coming from income levels that are upwards of $100,000 which we really are encouraged in seeing a younger consumer, a little bit more affluent, and again, very digitally and tech savvy. Yes. So I would tell you that I will first start and just say that we feel that, that trade down will continue to come in and benefit us. As it relates to the inventory levels, we couldn't be happier with where we sit today on inventory. We did all the right things early on, Michael, as you would imagine, coming from a Dollar General.

So this one extends up to 100. But again, the experience is very, very similar to those, for those consumers when they come in. So we believe that, that will be sticky as well. \n So when you think about our market share in just discretionary items. I also want to point out that, that was positive as well for the quarter. So we're picking up share even in a very tough environment on the discretionary side. \n And then lastly, your other question was around what type of items are we seeing as well. Even from our core customer, trading down -- trade down doesn't always mean just trading down from other retailers. It also is trading down when you get inside the box, and our core customer has been buying more private brands, that $1 price point, very, very important to her. If you think about things that have accelerated greatly over the last quarter, if you think of basic proteins that our core customer needs, so what we've seen is 15% to 20% increases over the last couple of quarters in canned meat, seafood, dry pasta, soups, rice and beans. So those core proteins, eggs, all those things that the consumer needs to feed her family but can do it at a much reduced price. So we're seeing that trade down effect as well, and we're in great position to take advantage of that, both from our everyday low retail price stance, as well as our supply chain is much more healthier there than we were last year at this time. Yes. Let me start, and I'm going to turn it over to Jeff as well. But I would tell you that, John, we feel great about those strategic initiatives. And to your point, not only a couple of years out, but 5 and 10 years out is the look. And if you look at the majority of them, there -- for instance, NCI, as an example, while we're close to the end of that rollout journey, the next phase of that, that optimization phase, is just starting.

And then we're just starting the journey. We're just getting up to the plate to use the analogy in both Mexico and in our health initiative. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got others we haven't even talked about ready to push into the pipeline. And Jeff, you may want to jump in just briefly. Yes. Thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General.

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, let me take a moment to thank Todd for his tremendous leadership and passion for our customers, our culture and this company. He has been a wonderful mentor and friend, and we wish him all the very best as he prepares to begin this new chapter. And let me also add my congratulations to Jeff, who I have known and worked closely with for several years. He is a highly respected leader throughout the organization, and we look forward to his leadership in the years ahead. \n Given Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me now take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. \n For Q2, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.3%, an increase of 69 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory markups, partially offset by a higher LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, as well as increases in markdowns, transportation costs, distribution costs and damages. Of note, product cost inflation was greater than anticipated, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $144 million during the quarter. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.6%, an increase of 82 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, repairs and maintenance, utilities and payroll taxes. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter increased 7.5% to $913 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 9.7%, a decrease of 13 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% and compares to 21.4% in the second quarter last year. Finally, as Todd noted, EPS for the second quarter increased 10.8% to $2.98. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remains strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term, while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 31.4% overall and 25.1% on a per store basis. Similar to Q1, this increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation, as well as a greater mix of higher-value products, particularly in the home and seasonal categories as a result of the continued rollout of our nonconsumables initiative. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape. \n As Todd noted, we're also pleased with the improvements we saw in our in-stock levels during the quarter and expect continued improvement as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well-positioned to better serve our customers in the back half of the year. \n Year-to-date through Q2, the business generated cash flows from operations totaling $948 million, a decrease of 28%. Total capital expenditures for the first half were $659 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $349 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $124 million. At the end of Q2, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion. We announced today that our Board has increased this authorization by $2 billion. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We continue to experience uncertainties with respect to product cost inflation, supply chain dynamics, the evolution of consumer spending throughout the year, and most recently, new store opening delays, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. Despite these challenges, we are confident in the business, and as Todd mentioned, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022. For the full year, we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 11%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week and same-store sales growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. \n Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week, share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our EPS outlook also now assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we anticipate comp sales to be fairly consistent between Q3 and Q4, but EPS growth to be much higher in the fourth quarter, which includes the anticipated benefit from the 53rd week. In addition, we expect share repurchases in Q3 to be slightly higher than the Q2 amount before increasing more substantially in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fourth quarter. Finally, as a result of an increase in interest rates and additional borrowings, we expect interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year. \n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including continued expansion of our private fleet, will drive additional benefits despite anticipated and continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected continuation of sales mix pressure, as well as sales outperformance as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. \n We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will continue to offset a portion of expected wage inflation. Finally, and consistent with Q2, our outlook includes continued investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours and wages to drive continued improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. \n In summary, we are proud of our team's hard work and commitment to execution, which has resulted in our strong second quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Thank you. Thanks, Rupesh. As you look at SG&A, nothing unusual there. One thing we had talked about was from a position of strength and given the sales outperformance and momentum that we were going to be making targeted proactive investments to build on that momentum, to help drive sales, as well as an enhanced customer experience. So really, it was consistent with that. \n The most notable one was adding some labor hours to help further improve our in-stock levels as well as that customer service. We really like what we're seeing there. Also, to a lesser extent, we did make targeted investments in wages in the physical box itself. But I would say more normal course proactive actions to drive the business. We also did see some inflation on utilities and did have some higher-than-normal R&M expenses associated with the weather. But I think when you look at just overall operating margin, we feel really good about what we're doing. \n We feel great about the gross margin expansion. A lot of the investments we make in SG&A really drives that gross margin expansion, which was up 69 basis for the quarter, and importantly, 1.5 points above where we were 3 years ago. So we really like to look at operating profit overall because, as we said before, the geography and the leverage changes a little bit as we spend a little bit on SG&A to drive more on gross margin as you look at the implied guidance with the sales and the strong bottom line guide for the year, that implies operating margin expansion over the back half. So we feel well positioned that we're making the right trade-offs and investments to drive that sales growth. Sure. I'll start with gross margin. We didn't give specific guidance on gross margin. But to give you some color around the puts and the takes, we do expect to continue to see mixed pressure over the course of the remainder of the year as sales outperformance exceeds -- on consumables, exceeds nonconsumables, as everybody is seeing. And we also do expect to see ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, as well as increased product cost inflation. So we expect that to continue. \n But I would tell you, on the transportation side and supply chain in general, we are seeing moderation there, and we do get an easier lap in the back half as we lap pretty substantial and growing supply chain inflation last year. And we're doing a lot of good things to help mitigate that. As Jeff mentioned in the prepared comments, doubling the size of the private fleet, really has a meaningful impact on that where we save about 20% on a per driver basis there. \n The other thing we called out was markdowns, but I would tell you, with the markdowns, that's really a function of normalization. We were lapping unusually low clearance markdowns and promotional markdowns last year. If you look at where we're at now, still well below pre-pandemic levels, but that lap will continue to be a bit of a pressure to us. \n But as we look at the back half of the year, in addition to the easing inflationary pressures, particularly on the supply chain and some other areas and the actions we're taking, we're continuing to see growing benefits from our strategic initiatives, which go after the top line and the bottom line other actions to help mitigate that. And as I mentioned previously, when you look at operating margin overall, it suggests expansion in the back half given all the actions we're taking. \n So -- and as we look ahead, I think we're very well positioned to continue to expand our gross margin over the long term. Todd talked about being in a great spot on price position. And again, as a limited SKU operator with our growth in size, I think it really positions us well in this environment to serve that customer very well. Be sharp on price, but to continue to expand our margins over the long term. \n And in terms of the question around why not raise EPS guidance, I would say that, first, very pleased based on the strength of the first half of the year and the anticipated results in the back half to raise the sales guidance, and pleased to reiterate the strong EPS guidance, while others have had to lower it in this challenging environment. We see the business fundamentals is very strong. It positions us very well to continue to be double-digit EPS growers over the long term, which we were at 10.8% this quarter. \n But there are some near-term headwinds. We mentioned the ongoing mix pressure. The overperformance in sales has been on the consumables side, which has lower margins. And while we do expect some moderation in inflation in the near term, it remains pressured with elevated supply chain costs, fuel costs and product cost inflation, of course, the LIFO charge, which continues throughout the year as that's spread over the year. \n Also another piece which you mentioned is the SG&A investment, which I talked about. I wouldn't say that's the only driver, the primary driver. But that is a driver to that. But again, we like what we're seeing there in terms of the investment in labor hours to help drive a better customer experience, to help drive sales and we are investing, as I mentioned, a little bit in targeted investments in wages in the box itself. \n And then the other thing we called out was interest. Interest will be higher in the back half of the year given higher interest rates and higher borrowings. So a number of near-term tailwinds, but we feel really good to be able to maintain that guidance, continue to see ourselves as double-digit EPS growers over the long term. And there's a lot of year left, but feel good about the guidance we've provided. Yes. As you look at sales in the second half, I mean, when you do the squeeze on that, that's quite healthy sales, not only on a 3-year basis, but as you look at the 1-year basis. To your point, we did see accelerating comps, we saw accelerating comps throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the momentum of the business going in. We feel really good about the new customers and basket size growth that we've been able to retain coming out of the pandemic. And we are starting to see signs of more customer trade down, that's contemplated in the guidance. I wouldn't say we have a significant impact from that built into the guidance. But based on what we're seeing, that is contemplated in there. We're seeing a bigger impact, as big as ever impact from our real estate with the strong performance of remodels and new units, which are exceeding our pro forma, and the initiatives are delivering. So we feel really good about where we're at, the momentum of the business, the fundamentals, and I think the guidance reflects that, as well as a little bit in there contemplated around that trade down. Yes. Again, I don't want to get too specific around gross margin guidance. But again, as you do the squeeze in the back half, it implies healthy, positive operating margin expansion and gross margin. We feel good about where we're at here in terms of sustainability over the long term to drive that. The biggest driver when you look, again, you go back to pre-pandemic levels where we're up 1.5 points in this quarter. It's the initiative is a huge piece of that. The ongoing benefit of DG Fresh and NCI, as we optimize and scale those, that's the gift that keeps on giving other things around the DG Media Network, just while promotional activity was a little bit higher versus pandemic where there was none. We remain very targeted in that and are doing a great job minimizing the clearance activity. \n So I think as you think the fundamental drivers of the initiatives, as you think about the other levers we've talked about, the efficiencies we're driving in supply chain, including the private fleet and the other levers we've talked about. And we do see spots where the inflation is starting to moderate, particularly around carrier rates ocean freight, we're seeing moderation there. It remains to be seen what happens to inflation overall with vendors, but we'd expect over time that growth, that pace of increases to start to moderate as well. \n And again, as you get to the back half of the year, we're lapping pretty substantial increasing supply chain inflationary laps. And so as we see some moderation and get easing laps, that will help as well. And that's all contemplated in the guide. Yes. As we touched on earlier, we do see improving conditions there. You're seeing additional supply capacity come online. You're seeing, obviously, demand drop as folks cut orders. And so when you look at both ocean freight and you look at domestic carrier rates, we're seeing those rates come down. And again, actions we're taking like with the private fleet is helping mitigate that as well. And we're coming up on a time where you're lapping increasing supply chain costs as you went from Q3 into Q4 last year. So I think net-net, we're doing a great job mitigating it. And I think that will, over time, switch to a tailwind as we see that moderate."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let me take a moment to express my appreciation for all Todd has done for this company throughout his 14-year career. He's led us through a transformational period and has positioned us extremely well for the future. On behalf of the entire Dollar General team, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact he has made on our business. I am fortunate to have been able to learn from him, and I look forward to his ongoing counsel. \n And as Todd noted, we are excited to announce that John has been promoted to President, while continuing to serve as CFO. John has made many significant contributions to Dollar General during his time leading our finance and corporate strategy teams, and I look forward to his continued leadership and partnership as he steps into this new role. \n Finally, let me also say how humbled and privileged I am by the opportunity to serve this great team as the next CEO of Dollar General. I couldn't be more excited about our future and all that we can accomplish together. \n Now let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to create opportunities for meaningful growth. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We continue to make progress executing against our robust portfolio of initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumable initiative, or NCI, which was available in nearly 15,000 stores at the end of the second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base. This treasure hunt offering continues to resonate with value-seeking customers as approximately 80% of the assortment is priced at $5 or less. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022, and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept, which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. \n During the quarter, we opened 14 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 80, located within 8 states. Additionally, we opened 7 new store-within-a-store concept during the second quarter. This brings the total number of Dollar General market stores, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store to a total of 32 at the end of the quarter. We plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, and now expect to open a total of 15 store-within-a-store concepts, which would bring us to about 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and approximately 40 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. \n Over the long term, we anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for these stores to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store, and expect the average gross margin rate to exceed 40%. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by year-end 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021, and are now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in frozen and refrigerated categories. We are also pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department, which had our strongest rate of comp sales growth during the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver an even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n And while produce was not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. Notably, at the end of Q2, we offered produce in more than 2,700 stores, with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. Finally, as I previously mentioned, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. \n During Q2, we added over 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our health initiative, branded as DG Wellbeing. The initial focus of this project is an expanded health offering, which consists of approximately 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in approximately 2,700 stores at the end of Q2, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n During the quarter, we announced the establishment of a new Healthcare Advisory Panel, which recently convened its first quarterly meeting. The panel is composed of highly regarded health care industry subject matter experts who will serve as thought partners to our team, including advising on how best to invest resources to better serve our customers in the health and wellness space. \n Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering, with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n To that end, we recently announced plans to significantly increase our supply chain capacity by building 3 new distribution centers in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Aurora, Colorado; and Salem, Oregon. Each facility will be approximately 1 million square feet and supported in part by our growing private fleet. We expect to begin construction on the Arkansas and Oregon facilities this fall, with both of which will be combo traditional and fresh distribution centers. We have already begun construction on the Colorado facility, which will be a traditional dry goods distribution center. We are excited about these new projects, which we expect will add more than 1,000 new jobs supporting our ongoing store growth and drive additional efficiencies in our supply chain. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 790 real estate projects, including 227 new stores, 533 remodels and 30 relocations. For 2022, we are updating our real estate plans to reflect adjustments made primarily in response to ongoing delays related to permitting and the receipt of construction materials associated with the new store openings. For 2022, we now plan to execute in the range of 2,930 to 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,010 to 1,060 new stores, approximately 1,795 remodels and about 125 store relocations. \n We continue to expect approximately 80% of our new Dollar General stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format, which allows us for an even greater assortment as we look to serve our customers with products they want and need. Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format, highlighted by increased sales productivity, and we continue to target returns in the range of 20% to 22%. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022, we are very excited about our plans to expand internationally, and we continue to make good progress towards our goal of opening our first stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. \n I am pleased to announce that these stores will be branded under the name [ The Super ] Dollar General, which resonated well with customer focus groups and connotes the idea of a local general store focused on serving customers with products they want and need most. In addition, the initial stores will be located in underserved communities in Northern Mexico as we look to initially leverage our brand awareness, while extending our value and convenience proposition to a customer base that is similar to our core customer in the United States. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. And with more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around creating a digital front porch to our stores as we look to create deeper and more meaningful connections with our customers. We ended Q2 with nearly 4.5 million monthly active users on the digital app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to resonate with both new and existing customers as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery and an hour or less. This offering was available in more than 13,300 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be very pleased with the results, including sales above our initial expectations for the first half of the year. \n In addition, we are also excited about the continued growth of our DG Media Network. We are seeing significant interest in participation from CPG companies and brands who are seeking to connect with the more than 80 million unique customer profiles, especially our rural customers, who represent about 30% of the country and allude the reach of other retail media networks. As a result, we are enabling advertisers to both digitally and physically build awareness and drive purchase consideration, while positioning Dollar General as a retailer of choice for customers seeking many of America's most trusted brands. \n After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are beginning to meaningfully grow this business, as we expand the program and enhance the value proposition for both our customers and brand partners, while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset. Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our current goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores and enhancing customer convenience. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution, while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. \n Self-checkout was available in approximately 10,000 stores at the end of Q2, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. \n We are also excited about our pilot in select stores, which provides customers the option to utilize self-checkout in all lanes, but also choose a staffed register preferred. We believe this full self-checkout option could further enhance our convenience proposition, while enabling store teams to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores by the end of this year. \n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative retail and small box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies, which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will drive greater efficiencies for our retail leaders and their teams. Our efforts to reduce costs have also benefited from our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 1,100 tractors at the end of Q2. \n As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development, and ultimately, career advancement. To that end, we are very pleased with our DG Discover Hiring event in Q2, which exceeded our goal for new hires, while adding significant talent to our teams in the field, distribution centers and private fleet. \n With regards to development, our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. We also continue to be pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. Ultimately, we believe that the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n We also held our annual leadership meeting earlier this month in Nashville, providing an important collaboration and development experience for more than 1,500 leaders of our company. This event is a high point for me every year, and I am always inspired by the incredible talent of our people and humbled by the way they live out their personal purpose, while fulfilling our mission to serve others. \n In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance as we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 173,000 employees for their work every day to make a difference in the lives of our customers, especially at times like this when they need us the most. I am excited about all that we will accomplish together in the second half of 2022 and beyond. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thank you. Yes. I would tell you, John, thank you for the question. And I think, we've never been more excited about the future. And to Todd's point earlier, it's not 2 to 3 years out. I mean, one of the things you got to think about is our, first of all, our pipeline for growth. I mean, that 17,000 additional opportunities, 13,000 general stores, 3,000 pOpshelf stores and 1,000 DGX. So First and foremost, our pipeline is extremely robust, and we're very pleased with this larger store format that we've been rolling out. 80% of our stores this year will be in that larger store format, and we're seeing the sales per square foot perform extremely well. So we're very pleased at how our new store performance is beating our pro forma expectations. \n And John, you've followed us for quite some time. We have pretty high expectations for our new store growth program. But as you think to the future also, you got to think about digital as well. I mean, our digital strategy and our acceleration there is serving us tremendously well. \n I mean, when you think about over 80 million profiles that we're able to connect with our CPG firms and our brand partners, and we believe we can expand that beyond traditional CPG and brand partners because we have a unique customer, almost 30% of the United States population in rural America, that's really hard to reach. And with our customer profiles, we're able to really connect multiple partners with that unique Dollar General customer that no one knows better than we do. \n But as you think down the road, Mexico, we're excited to open stores, and we said this before, we wouldn't be going to Mexico if we didn't think it was a huge opportunity. And then when you think about health, health is one of these where we're -- we just had our first meeting with our advisory panel. It was incredible. And you're going to hear a lot more about health here in the near term and in the future with our Chief Medical Officer, Albert Wu, his strategy and the way we're going to be able to provide access for a customer that's being underserved right now. \n So when you think down the road, it's extremely bright. And I would tell you, your comment about our teams, where do we have fertile ground? We have the best team in retail. And so when you look at every aspect of this Dollar General team, it's the unique and secret sauce of our success. And our culture has never been stronger. Our teams are energized to continue to move forward. So I think you can tell from my excitement, Todd's excitement, John's, that we see tremendous opportunity in the future. And I can't wait to update you guys in the near future on where we're going. Corey, thank you for the question, and thank you for the well wishes. One of the things we do so well here at Dollar General is we anticipate and look down the road. And we like to think we look around the corner real well, too. So that's exactly what this is. Our distribution strategy is in lockstep, as I mentioned just a minute ago. We have 17,000 additional opportunities, and that's across the entire U.S. And so we're very pleased at our ability to expand our distribution network because what it's going to do for us is it's going to continue to allow us to serve our stores better, make it more efficient, be able to pull cost out of the system and enable us to continue to grow. And as you can tell, we have significant growth prospects in the future. And that's all this is, is being able to make sure that our distribution is in line with our store opening plans, and those 2 teams work very, very well together to plan accordingly."

[Operator Instructions] \n Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to 2022, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other. \n Our Q1 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales results in our consumable category, where we delivered comp sales growth of 4.6%. This increase was offset by a decline of 15.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe reflects the challenging lap of the stimulus benefit in Q1 of 2021. \n In addition, we continue to experience headwinds from ongoing global supply chain pressures and rising cost inflation. Despite these challenges, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, and the team's disciplined execution was the key to delivering solid financial results that exceeded our Q1 expectations for both sales and EPS while also advancing our key operating priorities and strategic initiatives. \n I'm also pleased to report that we have continued to make improvements in our overall in-stock position, which we believe positions us well to drive strong top line performance through the remainder of the year. \n In addition, while we continue to see ongoing product cost inflation, we feel good about our price position as our price indexes relative to competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, especially in a more challenging economic environment. \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the first quarter. Despite lapping a difficult quarterly sales comparison from prior year, net sales increased 4.2% to $8.8 billion, and comp sales were essentially flat with a slight decrease of 0.1%. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were positive in February before turning negative in mid-March as we began to lap the stimulus benefit from prior year. As we move past the most challenging portion of the sales lap from 2021, comp sales turned positive in April, and we are pleased with our strong start to Q2, which has exceeded our initial expectations. \n As a result of our Q1 outperformance and strong start to Q2, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. \n Our first quarter sales results included a decline in customer traffic, which was mostly offset by growth in average basket size driven largely by inflation. Importantly, we are pleased with our market share gains in highly consumable product category sales for the quarter. These results were highlighted by gains in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past few years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. \n I'm also excited to note that we recently published our fourth annual Serving Other Report (sic) [ Serving Others Report ], which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts, as well as new and updated performance metrics and targets. We are proud of the team's efforts to serve our employees, customers, communities and the environment, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead. \n Overall, we are proud of our Q1 results. Our mission and culture remain unchanged, and we believe our strategic actions which have transformed this company in recent years positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail, and our unique value and convenience offering continues to resonate with both new and existing customers. I have never felt better about the underlying business model, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2022 and beyond. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all periods noted refer to the corresponding fiscal period. \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, we expanded our gross margin rate by 208 basis points in Q1 2021, which was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories. For Q1 2022, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3%, a decrease of 151 basis points. The decrease compared to Q1 2021 was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, a higher LIFO provision, increases in transportation costs, markdowns as a percentage of sales and distribution costs and higher inventory damages. \n Of note, while we have seen some moderation from Q4, our Q1 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q1 2021, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $85 million. In addition, product cost inflation was greater than expected, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $61 million during the quarter. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.8%, an increase of 78 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and utilities. These increases were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and winter storm-related disaster expenses. \n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 17.9% to $746 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 8.5%, a decrease of 229 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8% and compares to 22% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter decreased 14.5% to $2.41. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 19.4% overall and 13.3% on a per-store basis. This increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape and that we are well positioned with the right mix and balance of products. \n Going forward, as Todd mentioned, we expect continued improvement in our overall in-stock levels as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers. The business generated cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $450 million, a decrease of 36%. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $282 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $747 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $125 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Despite the ongoing uncertainties arising from cost inflation and continued pressure in the supply chain, we are confident in the business. As a result, and as Todd noted, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022 as we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 10% to 10.5%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; and same-store sales growth of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week; share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion; and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our updated outlook reflects our strong year-to-date top line performance and current sales expectations for the remainder of the year as well as updated margin and expense expectations. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we continue to anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. We also expect our share repurchases to be lower in Q2 and Q3 compared to the Q1 amount before increasing in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fiscal year.\n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, can drive additional benefits despite anticipated continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected increase in sales mix pressure as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. \n In addition, we expect ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, increased product cost inflation and expect to return to pre-pandemic rates of seasonal markdowns and increased inventory damages, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022. \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investment in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of expected wage inflation. \n Finally, our updated outlook includes plans to build on our sales momentum with targeted investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours, to drive an even greater improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. \n In summary, we are proud of our team's resilience and commitment to execution which resulted in our strong first quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffery Owen: Thanks, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as we continue to make good progress across our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of the first quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base, including continued incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase, on average, in NCI stores in their first year post implementation, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022 and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 11 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 66. \n Additionally, at the end of Q1, we had a total of 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores as we continue to be pleased with the results. We are on track to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, as well as open up to 25 store-within-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. \n We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for pOpshelf locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by end of 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, we offered produce in more than 2,300 stores at the end of the first quarter with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n Notably, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. In fact, during Q1, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. \n Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,800 stores at the end of Q1, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven, high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed more than 800 real estate projects, including 239 new stores, 532 remodels and 32 relocations. For 2022, our plans remain to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. \n As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format as we respond to our customers' desire for even wider product selection. With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts; an extended queue line; and a broader product assortment, including NCI, our larger health and beauty offering; and produce in many stores. \n Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format. While the initial cost to open these larger stores is about $300,000, including fixed assets and working capital, we are seeing increased sales productivity and continue to generate returns in the range of 20% to 22%. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022 and included in our total new store goal, we are also very excited about our plans to expand internationally: the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. With more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q1 with more than 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to yield strong results as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in about 11,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with the early results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our Dollar General Media Network, which is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our participating brand partners with over 90% of our unique customer base. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and further enhance the value proposition for customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Most recently, we launched a suite of financial offerings as we look to further leverage our unique footprint to provide our customers with additional services they want and need. These services include a spendwell-branded bank account and debit card offering; a buy now, pay later pilot in select number of stores; and a test of a rewards redemption program. These offerings aim to provide greater financial empowerment for customers while driving incremental traffic and profitability within our stores. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. \n Self-checkout was available in more than 8,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. As a result of the success of self-checkout and popularity with customers, we have recently launched a pilot of stores that are entirely self-checkout. While our associates will remain available to assist customers, if needed, in these stores, we believe this 100% self-checkout option could further enhance the convenience proposition while enabling our associates to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores throughout 2022. \n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. \n I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 950 tractors at the end of Q1 as compared to over 700 tractors at the end of 2021. As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. As a result of this planned growth, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control within our own supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately career advancement. To that end, we recently began offering access to 100% employer-paid college degree programs for all full-time employees. \n In addition, all Dollar General employees and their immediate family members now have access to online, on-demand, self-paced learning platform that provides college-level general education courses at no cost to them, which is intended to help initiate or further their education journey and development. These programs are in addition to several other existing development programs, including our fully paid private fleet driver training program, as well as the ability to earn undergraduate credits through the American Council on Education upon completion of our store manager training program. We continue to innovate on additional development opportunities for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. \n Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. \n We continue to monitor our competitive position in the market closely, and we are pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. \n In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance, and we are pleased with our great start to the year. I want to thank our more than 164,000 employees for their hard work as we all focus on fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am excited about our plans for the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Congratulations on a good quarter. So I wanted to just ask, so obviously, your format is very resilient in a weaker macro and should outperform, in general, in a weaker macro. But I think investors have been very concerned regarding discretionary risk as it relates to the comp and also to gross margin. So I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on how your -- with respect to your guidance on how you're thinking about comps with respect specifically to discretionary versus non and then general gross margin outlook as it relates to both categories because, I mean, my personal view is that you're obviously a lot more resilient than people realize -- or investors realize in terms of both those segments, comps and gross margins. So any color on that would be helpful. \nJohn Garratt: Sure. I'll take that question, Karen. With respect to sales -- and with both of these, that's obviously factored in. With respect to sales, feel very good about the raised guidance that we've provided there. We have taken into account that the overperformance was really driven by consumables, so that's been factored into the margin as well. So we continue to feel great about both sides of the business but have reflected the fact that it is more driven by the consumables. And the team has done a fantastic job of proactively adjusting the orders accordingly to minimize markdown risk. \n The other thing I'll note, just to give a little more color on the shape of the year with regard to sales, the way we see this is as we get past the -- now past the stimulus lap that has a significant impact on last year, both with sales, but also, it's the most difficult -- it's the most difficult, rather, mix lap of the year because they had a disproportionate effect on nonconsumables. Now that we're past that, we see a market improvement in our sales throughout the year, relatively even throughout the year and strongly positive. And then, obviously, you don't have as much -- while we expect a continued mix towards consumables, the lap isn't as significant now that you're past Q1. And again, that's all been reflected. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just to clarify, in terms of April meant 2Q off to a strong start. Any more granularity you could provide on that? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Karen. We're happy with what -- how we ended Q1. And as I indicated in my opening remarks, pretty upbeat on what we have seen in the first few weeks of Q2. And I would tell you, from a consumer perspective, the consumer is behaving intentional in their purchases, I have to say. But in saying that, she still is shopping both sides of the fence, both consumables and nonconsumables, and I think that really goes to the value that we have in both consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. We've done so much work around that discretionary side with NCI and all the other work that we've done that it's a compelling offering. Even when times are tough for the consumer, she always wants a little bit of an indulgence, and we offer that ability at a real low price. So yes, we feel good about the equation as we move forward, as John indicated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: How much did trade down contribute -- or customers trading down, those who may be facing some incremental economic stress, contribute to 1Q? How much have you assumed that will contribute to the rest of the year? And in that vein, how much did like-for-like price increases contribute in the quarter? And how much do you expect it to contribute to the rest of the year? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll take that. And I'll tell you that the consumer, overall, has been fairly resilient through this hyperinflation that we've seen, not only in the products that she has to buy, but the fuel she has to put in her car and other means. So I would tell you that the consumer is holding up well, and it really goes toward what I've talked about all along. And that is as long as she's gainfully employed, that makes the biggest difference in how she shops and gives her that confidence to spend.\n The great thing at Dollar General is that we offer that value that I just mentioned earlier, and we're already starting to see that our core customers start to shop more intentionally, and we're starting to see that next tier of customers start to shop with us a little bit more as well.\n Matter of fact, when you look at the COVID customer, I would call it, the one that we attracted and now have retained since COVID, it is still running at or slightly above where we thought we would be right now, and that's a little higher-end consumer. So that tells you that, that trade down and trade in is alive and well and is starting to probably pick up steam as we move through Q2 and into the back part of the year as things continue to tighten up. \n Lastly I'll mention is the gas prices. What would normally also occur and we're starting to see is she starts to shop closer to home, not only our core consumer, but that next cohort up, so that trade in that you mentioned, because let's admit it, right, the gas price is at $4.40, $4.50 a gallon now, on average, is keeping her closer to home. So those shopping patterns are definitely changing, and we're seeing it happen right before our eyes. \nMichael Lasser: And at the risk of being a little bit of a downer, and I apologize for that, one of your big competitors this morning announced they're going to be making some investments to narrow the price gap. Do you think you'll need to take down your prices further and maintain that price gap to continue to enjoy the success that Dollar General has achieved? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Michael, I would tell you we look at all competitors when we look at our price, and there's some much bigger competitors out there than the one that you are referring to that we watch really closely. The great thing is, is that our prices are right in our historical ranges, and we feel great about price. We've got plenty of ammunition to do whatever we need to do. But I would tell you that we've never felt better about our price position as we continue to move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. \n We've taken the opportunity, and I've mentioned this before, over the many, many months of -- through COVID to sharpen our prices even more, and I believe that what we're seeing right now against all classes of trade would tell you that Dollar General is in a great spot and has all of the levers that is disposable to continue to keep that positioning. We don't see anything on the horizon that gives us any concern there at all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on another nice quarter. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you. \nJohn Garratt: Thank you. \nMatthew Boss: So Todd, on value and convenience, it seems like this is really the key driver that you're citing as one of the main pieces to the continued momentum in the business. I guess how much do you attribute all of this to company-specific top line drivers? What initiatives do you think that you're the most excited about that still have legs? And then more so, as we think about the back half of the year, help us to think about the in-stock opportunity or other key drivers of the business on a year-over-year basis. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. I would tell you that our initiatives continue to push forward and also drive that top line. So if you think of DG Fresh, that continues to be our top driver. But one area that we have started to talk about recently and we'll continue to hear more and more about is our digital initiative, and I would tell you that, that digital initiative will continue to help propel that top line as well. It's driving not only our current customer but a different cohort of customer into Dollar General, and that is that cohort that is a little bit more digitally savvy.\n We have spent some nice capital over the many years building the platform for this. And really, in earnest, in the last 6 to 8 months, have really turned the dial up on moving that digital piece. So while others are worried about fixing fundamentals, we're really moving the needle forward on a lot of those big initiatives. So you think of DG Fresh, self-distribution of produce coming up in our supply chain as well. You think about digital. And then, of course, we're so excited still about NCI and pOpshelf. POpshelf is performing very well, even in a climate that one would consider the nonconsumable discretionary side of the business may be challenged. But pOpshelf continues to do well. That's what gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward into the upcoming months and years ahead.\n So we've got a tremendous amount of drivers, a lot more than value and convenience. But when they come into the store through all these other means that we're driving traffic into the store, they are definitely gravitating to value and convenience because everybody loves a deal. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then, John, maybe on the gross margin. How best to think about the build for the second quarter and the back half of the year relative to the first quarter? And just with that, if we think larger picture and maybe similar to my top line question, what inning would you say the company-specific benefits that you've seen from DG Fresh, NCI, maybe the private fleet, what inning are these in today as we think about margin benefits? \nJohn Garratt: Sure. No, great questions, Matt. I'll start with the first part of the question, just around how we're looking at gross margin. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with what we've been able to do to hang on to that gross margin goodness. While we were down about 1.5 points this quarter, we were lapping over 2 points of expansion last year. And if you go back to pre-pandemic levels, we're still 1 point above where we were. I think it really speaks to the impact of the initiatives.\n Now certainly, there are some near-term pressures that we called out. We talked about on the call the pressure from supply chain costs, which were an $85 million year-over-year headwind. Now that was down from Q4, which was $100 million. The other thing that we talked about was the LIFO provision of $61 million that we booked based on the anticipated inflation for the full year. And of course, we had the mix challenge. But again, as I mentioned before, much more pronounced in Q1 as we lap the significant impact of stimulus.\n So as we look forward, I mentioned we expect continued pressure on a year-over-year basis, not as much as we saw in Q1 as we get away from stimulus. We also expect continued pressure from supply chain, fuel costs, as well as product cost inflation. However, we expect it to improve as we move through the year. The lapse ease, particularly in the second half of the year, as we lap the very heavy inflation from last year. And we anticipate some moderation. We're seeing some moderation in the cost pressures due, in part, to the benefits of the initiatives and the cost reduction actions we've put in place.\n We mentioned the private fleet. We're going to double that in size this year as we convert tractors and trailers in-house that drives 20% savings. And we've done other actions to lock in more third-party capacity to manage our inventory very well, adjust to the changing demand of the customers. So we feel we're very well positioned. \n And as we look ahead, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but we expect EPS to improve sequentially as we go from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year for the reasons I mentioned and really see ourselves as you look at, again, the scaling impact of the initiatives you mentioned, we're in early innings there. They vary. But I would say in macro, we're probably, on average, third, fourth inning in most of these, on average, both in terms of the sales benefit as well as the gross margin benefit.\n So as these scale and as we work the other levers we've talked about, as we leverage our scale and as Todd mentioned, is we're in a very good place in price. We see ourselves in a very nice position to, over time, continue enhancing our gross margins. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: John, I have a follow-up to that question. It's on overall margin or incremental margins. I think you spoke to gross. So this was embedded in the guidance, even when you issued it in the fourth quarter, that you have the step-up in incremental margin sequentially throughout the year. Sales get better. But if you look at the incremental against the sales, it's still an above average rate for what this business has done historically. So I heard some of the commentary that you just said within the gross and why that gets better, but it seems like cost pressures that were present 3 months ago may be getting worse, not better. And then how do you reconcile that versus accelerating incremental throughout the year? \nJohn Garratt: No. I wouldn't say we see cost pressures getting worse. We mentioned the cadence around the inflation. I would say the moderation is going to be more gradual than originally thought, but we still are seeing moderation. We still expect moderation, and that's why we see that sequential improvement in EPS and overall margins as we move through the year.\n In terms of SG&A, we don't see any increased cost pressure there in terms of wage inflation. We've talked about that. We expect that growth in wage inflation to be well less than prior year, a little more than pre-pandemic levels but still manageable, and it's tracking where we expected there. \n We also mentioned making some targeted investments and specifically labor hours. It's really from a position of strength to continue driving the sales momentum to make sure we're good for the customer in terms of in-stock levels and customer experience but not a material step up there.\n So we feel very good about the guidance we've provided, maintaining the full year EPS guidance despite enhanced, as everyone has called out, inflationary pressures. I think the team has done a great job mitigating those and improving the in-stocks in the right categories to be ready to drive the top line and the bottom line. \nSimeon Gutman: And Todd mentioned that there's some tightening that's happening, that the maybe trade down is starting to pick up steam. Are you willing to share was that built into your plan? Are you seeing it happen quicker than the way your plan was built? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you that some of it was built in. We knew that the consumer was going to get tighter in 2022, just because of the lack of stimulus compared to last year. But I would tell you that because of other pressures, more inflation coming through on her everyday needs, as well as that fuel that I talked about, has quickened the pace a little bit. So we believe that she'll flee even further to value as she moves into the back half of the year. Especially as she gets to that holiday time frame, I believe that you'll see that. So we're very prepared for that.\n The last thing I'll also mention that shows us that she is starting to move that way a little quicker is, one is she's coming more often in those basket, unit sizes are a little bit smaller. That's the true sign. And also the $1 price point that we are really pushing and getting behind has really accelerated as well, and we're seeing that. So that would tell you that she's trying to make ends meet, and we'll be there for her because that's what we do best. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Todd, maybe to start with, right, the business is in a far better place than it was in '08 and '09, right? We did extremely well. How does the recession playbook look differently than back then in terms of -- and how quickly do you play that? What do you have to see to want to lean into that playbook? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. John, it's a good question, and thanks for that. I would tell you that we're in a much different spot, not only economically, meaning the consumer is in a little different spot here. And I think the biggest piece is that her employment is still very healthy across all cohorts of customers that we serve. So I think that's one of the big differences here than '08, '09. Now could that roll over? We're watching that, very well could, which would then just quicken the pace, that flight to value. But we haven't seen that yet but because of the other inflationary pieces we have seen.\n So there really isn't a lean-in in the playbook as much as it is knowing what that customer is going to do from historical times and then servicing I mentioned. And the reason we're leaning into that $1 price point is because we know how important that is during those times. Private brand, we've seen an acceleration in our private brand business as well in recent weeks. That's a true sign that she's starting to feel that pressure. So how do we respond? Well, you'll see more endcaps, more off-shelf displays of both $1 and private brand as we move through Q2 and then to the back half of the year. So we're really good and nimble, as you know, and to be able to move very quickly, so you'll see more and more of that. \n I think the important thing here is we're so different as a company than we were in '08, '09. I would hate to be fixing fundamentals right now because the opportunity to gain share is going to be tremendous as we, I believe, move through this year. And we're so far beyond that with all of the initiatives that we've put in place over the last 6, 7 years. It's nice to see that we're going to be in a position to take an oversized amount of share, we believe, as we move through the back half of the year. \nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe secondly, right, on your -- the health and beauty assortment, maybe it's too early to tell. But when you look at those items in the basket or the people who are buying them, what are you seeing, right, in terms of frequency of shop, basket size, co-purchases? And that's typically a very loyal customer. Do you think that will drive more frequency? Is that the primary benefit you think you'll see? \nJeffery Owen: John, this is Jeff, and thank you for that question. As we think about health, we've been saying this for quite some time, the largest share donor we're seeing in our business certainly is from the drug channel. And so that's one of the reasons, as you've heard us say before, why we're leaning in here. And so certainly, with 30% more selling space and 400 additional items, we're really pleased to be in 1,800 stores and be in 4,000 by the end of the year. And what we're seeing in the customer's response is very good, and we're excited about what we're seeing, not only in her take rates, but also when you break down the basket.\n So when you think about Dollar General, I think the best way to think about this is this way. When you look at our mainstays, like home cleaning and paper where we have closer to a 10% share and when you think about this particular area where we're closer to a 4%, it really paints the opportunity for us to continue to grow share in this particular area. And as we've said before, we do classify this as consumable, but it has margins that are akin more to nonconsumable. And when you step back and you think about the larger footprint that we talk about, where 80% of our stores in 2022 will be in that larger 8,500 square foot footprint, it gives us the full theater to put this in place.\n So I think you see from -- why we're so excited, but also, I think you see the intentional nature of how we layer this into our strategic view of the business and how we look forward and around the corner. So I think you'll see more to come there. We're really excited about what we see. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I have 2 questions on the inflation front. So first, what are you seeing right now from a product cost inflation perspective? And then second, are you -- are there any challenges you're seeing right now in passing through some of the higher prices? \nTodd Vasos: Rupesh, it's Todd. Real quickly, obviously, we've seen what others have seen on that. We're in a little different spot, though, and our product mix is much different than the broader retail spectrum. So I would tell you that we're seeing, on average, a lot less cost pressure than what you would find in retail in general. That's number one.\n The second piece is we have the ability here to trade off items and to trade down sizes, which we've been very active over the last 6, 8 months on when we saw inflation starting to move in a little different direction. So we've got the ability to do that. That's what we do best on our merch side, and so we've done a lot of that to also push off some of those costs to the consumer.\n But as it relates to when we do have to put costs out there -- I'm sorry, additional retail to cover some of that CPG cost, we've been able to do that because we do it the Dollar General way, right? And we make sure that we can layer it in where the consumer still knows and sees the value of what we offer. \n And again, as I mentioned in my earlier comment, we haven't felt better about where we are. We're right in historical levels of our pricing index as compared to all classes of trade, so I believe we've got the ability to pass on where we need to, but more importantly, to help defray some of that pass-on to the consumer through our category management efforts, which, again, we're probably one of the best in the industry on. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just on your discretionary categories, just given many of the concerns out there, did anything differ versus your expectations during the quarter? I know weather did have an impact potentially on some of the categories but just curious if you've seen any changes in consumer behavior within those discretionary categories. \nTodd Vasos: Yes. As I mentioned also a little earlier, the consumer is becoming more and more intentional in her purchases. We've seen that, and what that means is taking care of her family a little bit more on the consumable side of the business, where she needs to make sure she buys; and then on that discretionary side, obviously, tightening the belt a little bit. So yes, we saw that. We knew that was going to occur, just because of the stimulus lap. But as I also mentioned, we saw it probably accelerate a little faster than where we thought it would as well.\n But the great thing is the buying team has been all over this. So what we're already doing is as we see the -- with the third and fourth quarter and be able to still yet adjust, we're able to go in and adjust the products that we're selling on that discretionary side as well as making sure that the prices are right on that discretionary side, especially as we get to the important fourth quarter selling season.\n So we feel like we've seen where that consumer is probably going to land on a mix basis, discretionary versus non, but we also believe we've made the right trade-offs, and as John indicated, feel real good about our inventory levels there and not concerned at all at this point on any markdown risk that may be there. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Our first question was just around the SNAP benefit, just how the SNAP composition has changed at DG over the last couple of quarters and what your projection is for the rest of the year. \nJohn Garratt: Yes. It continues to be elevated over pre-pandemic levels. The Thrifty Food Plan is still a benefit there. And while you have some states pulling out of the emergency waivers, it's been very gradual. And so it's still mixing quite a bit higher than norm, just not at the same peak level it was in the middle of last year, but doing very well there, continue to gain share with that customer and serve them very well. \nKatharine McShane: Question is just about traffic. Is there an expectation of when you think that can inflect positively? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. I would tell you that we actually closed out Q1 with a positive traffic number, which was really good to see. And as I indicated in my opening comments, like what we see on our start to Q2, and I think you can actually take from that, that our traffic number is looking much better than it was. So we feel as we get further and further away from that stimulus lap that John referred to, we believe we've got the right products, initiatives, price points, especially in this environment to drive that traffic long term. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Firstly, on international as it relates to Mexico, can you provide an update as to where you are on progress for expansion into that region? \nJeffery Owen: Thanks, Corey. This is Jeff. So in Mexico, I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time. I would tell you, we have assembled a fantastic team of retailers, and folks are really excited about joining the opportunity. \n So first and foremost, the team is incredibly impressive with decades of experience. That's the first point. The second point is, is that we continue to make great progress around learning how to serve this customer. And as we've mentioned before, we have a lot of analogs that gave us great confidence to even expand internationally from a lot of the performance and customers we serve along the border, which we've done historically incredibly well here at Dollar General.\n So as we learn more and more about that consumer, we're really excited about what we are able to offer her and tailor it to her needs and also really rely a lot on what we've been able to do so well here in the United States. So feel great about the assortment and the build that we're doing there, feel real good about the supply chain progress and then also on the real estate. In fact, we've been down there a couple of weeks ago and headed down there here shortly to continue to look at the sites and been very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our ability to be convenient and be that community-serving retailer that we are here in the U.S. and excited about what we're going to be able to do in Mexico. And we still feel real good about our initial expectation of up to 10 stores by the end of the year. \nCorey Tarlowe: That's great. And then just a follow-up question for John. As it relates to capital allocation, how are you thinking about the balance sheet and cash levels, balancing the dividend, close to $3 billion in share repurchases and then $1.5 billion in CapEx? \nJohn Garratt: Yes. We're still thinking about the same way in terms of the priorities. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you can get these kind of returns on new stores and the kind of returns we're getting on our strategic initiative that positions us so well, that's where we're going to continue to invest first. Then it's paying a competitive dividend, which we increased 31% year-over-year on a quarterly basis. And then the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. And as you mentioned, we're going to target $2.75 billion this year, so really meaningfully investing in the business, meaningfully returning cash to shareholders in these forms. \n And in terms of CapEx, with these kind of returns, we're going to invest what we need to. But again, I think with that amount, we're doing quite a bit with it. It is up a little bit as a percent of sales from historical norms. But the biggest piece of that is just steel inflation. And so if you strip that out, it's kind of back down to that historical level of a little over 3% of our sales. So feel really good about the allocation. It's working very well for us and I think working very well for the investors. \nTodd Vasos: Well, thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of our team which continues to execute at a high level for our customers every day. I'm sure you can tell I'm more excited about this business than ever before. We are a mature retailer in growth mode, and our strategic focus has differentiated us in a discount retail landscape, particularly as we have transformed this company in the last few years. As a result, I believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us. \n Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our strong start to 2022, and I want to thank our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers, communities and each other. \n Our Q1 performance was led by stronger-than-expected sales results in our consumable category, where we delivered comp sales growth of 4.6%. This increase was offset by a decline of 15.1% in our combined nonconsumable categories, which we believe reflects the challenging lap of the stimulus benefit in Q1 of 2021. \n In addition, we continue to experience headwinds from ongoing global supply chain pressures and rising cost inflation. Despite these challenges, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, and the team's disciplined execution was the key to delivering solid financial results that exceeded our Q1 expectations for both sales and EPS while also advancing our key operating priorities and strategic initiatives. \n I'm also pleased to report that we have continued to make improvements in our overall in-stock position, which we believe positions us well to drive strong top line performance through the remainder of the year. \n In addition, while we continue to see ongoing product cost inflation, we feel good about our price position as our price indexes relative to competitors and other classes of trade remain in line with our targeted and historical ranges. And with more than 18,000 stores located within 5 miles of about 75% of the U.S. population, we believe we are well positioned to continue supporting our customers through our unique combination of value and convenience, especially in a more challenging economic environment. \n Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to strengthen our competitive position while further differentiating Dollar General from the rest of the retail landscape. \n Now let me recap some of the additional financial results for the first quarter. Despite lapping a difficult quarterly sales comparison from prior year, net sales increased 4.2% to $8.8 billion, and comp sales were essentially flat with a slight decrease of 0.1%. From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales were positive in February before turning negative in mid-March as we began to lap the stimulus benefit from prior year. As we move past the most challenging portion of the sales lap from 2021, comp sales turned positive in April, and we are pleased with our strong start to Q2, which has exceeded our initial expectations. \n As a result of our Q1 outperformance and strong start to Q2, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our sales outlook for fiscal 2022, which John will discuss in more detail shortly. \n Our first quarter sales results included a decline in customer traffic, which was mostly offset by growth in average basket size driven largely by inflation. Importantly, we are pleased with our market share gains in highly consumable product category sales for the quarter. These results were highlighted by gains in our frozen and refrigerated product categories, where we have placed a good deal of emphasis over the past few years in an effort to provide customers with an even wider variety of options. \n I'm also excited to note that we recently published our fourth annual Serving Other Report (sic) [ Serving Others Report ], which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts, as well as new and updated performance metrics and targets. We are proud of the team's efforts to serve our employees, customers, communities and the environment, and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead. \n Overall, we are proud of our Q1 results. Our mission and culture remain unchanged, and we believe our strategic actions which have transformed this company in recent years positions us well for continued success while supporting long-term shareholder value creation. We continue to operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail, and our unique value and convenience offering continues to resonate with both new and existing customers. I have never felt better about the underlying business model, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2022 and beyond. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to John. Yes, Karen. We're happy with what -- how we ended Q1. And as I indicated in my opening remarks, pretty upbeat on what we have seen in the first few weeks of Q2. And I would tell you, from a consumer perspective, the consumer is behaving intentional in their purchases, I have to say. But in saying that, she still is shopping both sides of the fence, both consumables and nonconsumables, and I think that really goes to the value that we have in both consumables and nonconsumables side of the business. We've done so much work around that discretionary side with NCI and all the other work that we've done that it's a compelling offering. Even when times are tough for the consumer, she always wants a little bit of an indulgence, and we offer that ability at a real low price. So yes, we feel good about the equation as we move forward, as John indicated. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll take that. And I'll tell you that the consumer, overall, has been fairly resilient through this hyperinflation that we've seen, not only in the products that she has to buy, but the fuel she has to put in her car and other means. So I would tell you that the consumer is holding up well, and it really goes toward what I've talked about all along. And that is as long as she's gainfully employed, that makes the biggest difference in how she shops and gives her that confidence to spend.\n The great thing at Dollar General is that we offer that value that I just mentioned earlier, and we're already starting to see that our core customers start to shop more intentionally, and we're starting to see that next tier of customers start to shop with us a little bit more as well.\n Matter of fact, when you look at the COVID customer, I would call it, the one that we attracted and now have retained since COVID, it is still running at or slightly above where we thought we would be right now, and that's a little higher-end consumer. So that tells you that, that trade down and trade in is alive and well and is starting to probably pick up steam as we move through Q2 and into the back part of the year as things continue to tighten up. \n Lastly I'll mention is the gas prices. What would normally also occur and we're starting to see is she starts to shop closer to home, not only our core consumer, but that next cohort up, so that trade in that you mentioned, because let's admit it, right, the gas price is at $4.40, $4.50 a gallon now, on average, is keeping her closer to home. So those shopping patterns are definitely changing, and we're seeing it happen right before our eyes. Yes. Michael, I would tell you we look at all competitors when we look at our price, and there's some much bigger competitors out there than the one that you are referring to that we watch really closely. The great thing is, is that our prices are right in our historical ranges, and we feel great about price. We've got plenty of ammunition to do whatever we need to do. But I would tell you that we've never felt better about our price position as we continue to move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. \n We've taken the opportunity, and I've mentioned this before, over the many, many months of -- through COVID to sharpen our prices even more, and I believe that what we're seeing right now against all classes of trade would tell you that Dollar General is in a great spot and has all of the levers that is disposable to continue to keep that positioning. We don't see anything on the horizon that gives us any concern there at all. Thank you. Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. I would tell you that our initiatives continue to push forward and also drive that top line. So if you think of DG Fresh, that continues to be our top driver. But one area that we have started to talk about recently and we'll continue to hear more and more about is our digital initiative, and I would tell you that, that digital initiative will continue to help propel that top line as well. It's driving not only our current customer but a different cohort of customer into Dollar General, and that is that cohort that is a little bit more digitally savvy.\n We have spent some nice capital over the many years building the platform for this. And really, in earnest, in the last 6 to 8 months, have really turned the dial up on moving that digital piece. So while others are worried about fixing fundamentals, we're really moving the needle forward on a lot of those big initiatives. So you think of DG Fresh, self-distribution of produce coming up in our supply chain as well. You think about digital. And then, of course, we're so excited still about NCI and pOpshelf. POpshelf is performing very well, even in a climate that one would consider the nonconsumable discretionary side of the business may be challenged. But pOpshelf continues to do well. That's what gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward into the upcoming months and years ahead.\n So we've got a tremendous amount of drivers, a lot more than value and convenience. But when they come into the store through all these other means that we're driving traffic into the store, they are definitely gravitating to value and convenience because everybody loves a deal. Yes. I would tell you that some of it was built in. We knew that the consumer was going to get tighter in 2022, just because of the lack of stimulus compared to last year. But I would tell you that because of other pressures, more inflation coming through on her everyday needs, as well as that fuel that I talked about, has quickened the pace a little bit. So we believe that she'll flee even further to value as she moves into the back half of the year. Especially as she gets to that holiday time frame, I believe that you'll see that. So we're very prepared for that.\n The last thing I'll also mention that shows us that she is starting to move that way a little quicker is, one is she's coming more often in those basket, unit sizes are a little bit smaller. That's the true sign. And also the $1 price point that we are really pushing and getting behind has really accelerated as well, and we're seeing that. So that would tell you that she's trying to make ends meet, and we'll be there for her because that's what we do best. Yes. John, it's a good question, and thanks for that. I would tell you that we're in a much different spot, not only economically, meaning the consumer is in a little different spot here. And I think the biggest piece is that her employment is still very healthy across all cohorts of customers that we serve. So I think that's one of the big differences here than '08, '09. Now could that roll over? We're watching that, very well could, which would then just quicken the pace, that flight to value. But we haven't seen that yet but because of the other inflationary pieces we have seen.\n So there really isn't a lean-in in the playbook as much as it is knowing what that customer is going to do from historical times and then servicing I mentioned. And the reason we're leaning into that $1 price point is because we know how important that is during those times. Private brand, we've seen an acceleration in our private brand business as well in recent weeks. That's a true sign that she's starting to feel that pressure. So how do we respond? Well, you'll see more endcaps, more off-shelf displays of both $1 and private brand as we move through Q2 and then to the back half of the year. So we're really good and nimble, as you know, and to be able to move very quickly, so you'll see more and more of that. \n I think the important thing here is we're so different as a company than we were in '08, '09. I would hate to be fixing fundamentals right now because the opportunity to gain share is going to be tremendous as we, I believe, move through this year. And we're so far beyond that with all of the initiatives that we've put in place over the last 6, 7 years. It's nice to see that we're going to be in a position to take an oversized amount of share, we believe, as we move through the back half of the year. Rupesh, it's Todd. Real quickly, obviously, we've seen what others have seen on that. We're in a little different spot, though, and our product mix is much different than the broader retail spectrum. So I would tell you that we're seeing, on average, a lot less cost pressure than what you would find in retail in general. That's number one.\n The second piece is we have the ability here to trade off items and to trade down sizes, which we've been very active over the last 6, 8 months on when we saw inflation starting to move in a little different direction. So we've got the ability to do that. That's what we do best on our merch side, and so we've done a lot of that to also push off some of those costs to the consumer.\n But as it relates to when we do have to put costs out there -- I'm sorry, additional retail to cover some of that CPG cost, we've been able to do that because we do it the Dollar General way, right? And we make sure that we can layer it in where the consumer still knows and sees the value of what we offer. \n And again, as I mentioned in my earlier comment, we haven't felt better about where we are. We're right in historical levels of our pricing index as compared to all classes of trade, so I believe we've got the ability to pass on where we need to, but more importantly, to help defray some of that pass-on to the consumer through our category management efforts, which, again, we're probably one of the best in the industry on. Yes. As I mentioned also a little earlier, the consumer is becoming more and more intentional in her purchases. We've seen that, and what that means is taking care of her family a little bit more on the consumable side of the business, where she needs to make sure she buys; and then on that discretionary side, obviously, tightening the belt a little bit. So yes, we saw that. We knew that was going to occur, just because of the stimulus lap. But as I also mentioned, we saw it probably accelerate a little faster than where we thought it would as well.\n But the great thing is the buying team has been all over this. So what we're already doing is as we see the -- with the third and fourth quarter and be able to still yet adjust, we're able to go in and adjust the products that we're selling on that discretionary side as well as making sure that the prices are right on that discretionary side, especially as we get to the important fourth quarter selling season.\n So we feel like we've seen where that consumer is probably going to land on a mix basis, discretionary versus non, but we also believe we've made the right trade-offs, and as John indicated, feel real good about our inventory levels there and not concerned at all at this point on any markdown risk that may be there. Yes. I would tell you that we actually closed out Q1 with a positive traffic number, which was really good to see. And as I indicated in my opening comments, like what we see on our start to Q2, and I think you can actually take from that, that our traffic number is looking much better than it was. So we feel as we get further and further away from that stimulus lap that John referred to, we believe we've got the right products, initiatives, price points, especially in this environment to drive that traffic long term. Well, thank you for all the questions, and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of our team which continues to execute at a high level for our customers every day. I'm sure you can tell I'm more excited about this business than ever before. We are a mature retailer in growth mode, and our strategic focus has differentiated us in a discount retail landscape, particularly as we have transformed this company in the last few years. As a result, I believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us. \n Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "John Garratt",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all periods noted refer to the corresponding fiscal period. \n As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. As a reminder, we expanded our gross margin rate by 208 basis points in Q1 2021, which was positively impacted by a significant increase in sales, including net sales growth of 16% in our combined nonconsumable categories. For Q1 2022, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.3%, a decrease of 151 basis points. The decrease compared to Q1 2021 was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of sales coming from our consumables category, a higher LIFO provision, increases in transportation costs, markdowns as a percentage of sales and distribution costs and higher inventory damages. \n Of note, while we have seen some moderation from Q4, our Q1 supply chain expenses were significantly higher compared to Q1 2021, resulting in a headwind to gross margin of approximately $85 million. In addition, product cost inflation was greater than expected, resulting in a LIFO provision of approximately $61 million during the quarter. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups. \n SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.8%, an increase of 78 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of sales, the most significant of which were retail labor, store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and utilities. These increases were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and winter storm-related disaster expenses. \n Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 17.9% to $746 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 8.5%, a decrease of 229 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8% and compares to 22% in the first quarter last year. Finally, EPS for the first quarter decreased 14.5% to $2.41. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were $6.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 19.4% overall and 13.3% on a per-store basis. This increase primarily reflects the impact of product cost inflation as well as a greater mix of higher-value products. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory is in good shape and that we are well positioned with the right mix and balance of products. \n Going forward, as Todd mentioned, we expect continued improvement in our overall in-stock levels as we move through 2022, underscoring our optimism that we are well positioned to serve our customers. The business generated cash flow from operations during the quarter totaling $450 million, a decrease of 36%. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $282 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to the strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $747 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $125 million. At the end of Q1, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. \n Moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Despite the ongoing uncertainties arising from cost inflation and continued pressure in the supply chain, we are confident in the business. As a result, and as Todd noted, we are increasing our sales outlook for 2022 as we now expect the following: net sales growth of approximately 10% to 10.5%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 2 percentage points from the 53rd week; and same-store sales growth of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Additionally, we are reiterating the remainder of our financial guidance for 2022, which includes EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%, including an estimated benefit of approximately 4 percentage points from the 53rd week; share repurchases of approximately $2.75 billion; and capital spending in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Our updated outlook reflects our strong year-to-date top line performance and current sales expectations for the remainder of the year as well as updated margin and expense expectations. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook. In terms of the quarterly cadence, we continue to anticipate both comp sales and EPS growth to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half. We also expect our share repurchases to be lower in Q2 and Q3 compared to the Q1 amount before increasing in Q4, partially as a result of the extra week in our fiscal year.\n Turning now to gross margin for 2022. We expect to continue realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and NCI throughout the year. In addition, we are optimistic that distribution and transportation efficiencies, including significant expansion of our private fleet, can drive additional benefits despite anticipated continued cost pressures in the near term. Offsetting some of these benefits is an expected increase in sales mix pressure as our sales outperformance has been predominantly driven by growth in our consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories. \n In addition, we expect ongoing supply chain pressures, including higher fuel costs, increased product cost inflation and expect to return to pre-pandemic rates of seasonal markdowns and increased inventory damages, all of which are expected to be headwinds in 2022. \n With regards to SG&A, we expect continued investment in our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect they will positively contribute to operating profit margin in 2022 as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated SG&A expense. We also continue to pursue efficiencies and savings through our Save to Serve program, including Fast Track, and we believe these savings in 2022 will offset a portion of expected wage inflation. \n Finally, our updated outlook includes plans to build on our sales momentum with targeted investments to further enhance the customer experience, including incremental labor hours, to drive an even greater improvement in overall in-stock levels and customer service. \n In summary, we are proud of our team's resilience and commitment to execution which resulted in our strong first quarter results. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Sure. I'll take that question, Karen. With respect to sales -- and with both of these, that's obviously factored in. With respect to sales, feel very good about the raised guidance that we've provided there. We have taken into account that the overperformance was really driven by consumables, so that's been factored into the margin as well. So we continue to feel great about both sides of the business but have reflected the fact that it is more driven by the consumables. And the team has done a fantastic job of proactively adjusting the orders accordingly to minimize markdown risk. \n The other thing I'll note, just to give a little more color on the shape of the year with regard to sales, the way we see this is as we get past the -- now past the stimulus lap that has a significant impact on last year, both with sales, but also, it's the most difficult -- it's the most difficult, rather, mix lap of the year because they had a disproportionate effect on nonconsumables. Now that we're past that, we see a market improvement in our sales throughout the year, relatively even throughout the year and strongly positive. And then, obviously, you don't have as much -- while we expect a continued mix towards consumables, the lap isn't as significant now that you're past Q1. And again, that's all been reflected. Thank you. Sure. No, great questions, Matt. I'll start with the first part of the question, just around how we're looking at gross margin. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with what we've been able to do to hang on to that gross margin goodness. While we were down about 1.5 points this quarter, we were lapping over 2 points of expansion last year. And if you go back to pre-pandemic levels, we're still 1 point above where we were. I think it really speaks to the impact of the initiatives.\n Now certainly, there are some near-term pressures that we called out. We talked about on the call the pressure from supply chain costs, which were an $85 million year-over-year headwind. Now that was down from Q4, which was $100 million. The other thing that we talked about was the LIFO provision of $61 million that we booked based on the anticipated inflation for the full year. And of course, we had the mix challenge. But again, as I mentioned before, much more pronounced in Q1 as we lap the significant impact of stimulus.\n So as we look forward, I mentioned we expect continued pressure on a year-over-year basis, not as much as we saw in Q1 as we get away from stimulus. We also expect continued pressure from supply chain, fuel costs, as well as product cost inflation. However, we expect it to improve as we move through the year. The lapse ease, particularly in the second half of the year, as we lap the very heavy inflation from last year. And we anticipate some moderation. We're seeing some moderation in the cost pressures due, in part, to the benefits of the initiatives and the cost reduction actions we've put in place.\n We mentioned the private fleet. We're going to double that in size this year as we convert tractors and trailers in-house that drives 20% savings. And we've done other actions to lock in more third-party capacity to manage our inventory very well, adjust to the changing demand of the customers. So we feel we're very well positioned. \n And as we look ahead, we're not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but we expect EPS to improve sequentially as we go from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year for the reasons I mentioned and really see ourselves as you look at, again, the scaling impact of the initiatives you mentioned, we're in early innings there. They vary. But I would say in macro, we're probably, on average, third, fourth inning in most of these, on average, both in terms of the sales benefit as well as the gross margin benefit.\n So as these scale and as we work the other levers we've talked about, as we leverage our scale and as Todd mentioned, is we're in a very good place in price. We see ourselves in a very nice position to, over time, continue enhancing our gross margins. No. I wouldn't say we see cost pressures getting worse. We mentioned the cadence around the inflation. I would say the moderation is going to be more gradual than originally thought, but we still are seeing moderation. We still expect moderation, and that's why we see that sequential improvement in EPS and overall margins as we move through the year.\n In terms of SG&A, we don't see any increased cost pressure there in terms of wage inflation. We've talked about that. We expect that growth in wage inflation to be well less than prior year, a little more than pre-pandemic levels but still manageable, and it's tracking where we expected there. \n We also mentioned making some targeted investments and specifically labor hours. It's really from a position of strength to continue driving the sales momentum to make sure we're good for the customer in terms of in-stock levels and customer experience but not a material step up there.\n So we feel very good about the guidance we've provided, maintaining the full year EPS guidance despite enhanced, as everyone has called out, inflationary pressures. I think the team has done a great job mitigating those and improving the in-stocks in the right categories to be ready to drive the top line and the bottom line. Yes. It continues to be elevated over pre-pandemic levels. The Thrifty Food Plan is still a benefit there. And while you have some states pulling out of the emergency waivers, it's been very gradual. And so it's still mixing quite a bit higher than norm, just not at the same peak level it was in the middle of last year, but doing very well there, continue to gain share with that customer and serve them very well. Yes. We're still thinking about the same way in terms of the priorities. Our first priority remains investing in the business. When you can get these kind of returns on new stores and the kind of returns we're getting on our strategic initiative that positions us so well, that's where we're going to continue to invest first. Then it's paying a competitive dividend, which we increased 31% year-over-year on a quarterly basis. And then the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which allows us to buy back shares. And as you mentioned, we're going to target $2.75 billion this year, so really meaningfully investing in the business, meaningfully returning cash to shareholders in these forms. \n And in terms of CapEx, with these kind of returns, we're going to invest what we need to. But again, I think with that amount, we're doing quite a bit with it. It is up a little bit as a percent of sales from historical norms. But the biggest piece of that is just steel inflation. And so if you strip that out, it's kind of back down to that historical level of a little over 3% of our sales. So feel really good about the allocation. It's working very well for us and I think working very well for the investors."

            "name": "Jeffery Owen",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We are off to a great start to the year as we continue to make good progress across our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me take you through some of the recent highlights. \n Starting with our nonconsumables initiative, or NCI, which was available in more than 13,000 stores at the end of the first quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the strong sales and margin performance we are seeing across our NCI store base, including continued incremental 2.5% total comp sales increase, on average, in NCI stores in their first year post implementation, along with a meaningful improvement in gross margin rate. We expect to realize ongoing sales and margin benefits from NCI in 2022 and are on track to complete the rollout across nearly the entire chain by the end of the year. \n Moving to our pOpshelf store concept which further builds on our success and learnings with NCI. As a reminder, pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $5 or less. During the quarter, we opened 11 new pOpshelf locations, bringing the total number of stores to 66. \n Additionally, at the end of Q1, we had a total of 25 store-within-a-store concepts, which incorporates a smaller footprint pOpshelf store into one of our larger-format Dollar General market stores as we continue to be pleased with the results. We are on track to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count this year, as well as open up to 25 store-within-store concepts, which would bring us to a total of more than 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 50 store-within-a-store concepts by year-end. \n We continue to anticipate year 1 annualized sales volumes for pOpshelf locations to be between $1.7 million and $2 million per store and expect the initial average gross margin rate for these stores to exceed 40%. Overall, we are very pleased with the results from this unique and differentiated concept, and we are excited about our goal of approximately 1,000 pOpshelf locations by end of 2025. \n Turning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, along with a focus on driving continued sales growth in these areas. As a reminder, we completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain in 2021 and are now delivering to more than 18,000 stores from 12 facilities. The initial objective of DG Fresh was to reduce product cost on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing. \n Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in our frozen and refrigerated categories. We are pleased with the performance on this front, including enhanced product offerings in stores and strong performance from our perishables department. Looking ahead, we expect to realize additional benefits from DG Fresh as we continue to optimize our network, further leverage our scale, deliver even wider product selection and build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. \n And while produce is not included in our initial rollout, we continue to believe that DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time. To that end, we offered produce in more than 2,300 stores at the end of the first quarter with plans to expand this offering to a total of more than 3,000 stores by the end of 2022. \n Notably, DG Fresh has also extended the reach of our cooler expansion program. In fact, during Q1, we added more than 17,000 cooler doors across our store base, and we are on track to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2022. \n Importantly, despite the meaningful improvements we have made to date as a result of DG Fresh, we believe we still have significant incremental opportunity to drive additional returns with this initiative in the years ahead. \n Turning now to an update on our expanded health offering, which consists of up to 30% more feet of selling space and up to 400 additional items as compared to our standard offering. This offering was available in nearly 1,800 stores at the end of Q1, and we are on track to expand to a total of more than 4,000 stores by the end of 2022. Looking ahead, our plans include further expansion of our health offering with the goal of increasing access to basic health care products and ultimately services over time, particularly in rural America. \n In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with the initiatives I just discussed, we continue to pursue other opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing, supply chain efficiencies and shrink reduction. \n Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven, high-return, low-risk real estate model has served us well for many years and continues to be a core strength of our business. In the first quarter, we completed more than 800 real estate projects, including 239 new stores, 532 remodels and 32 relocations. For 2022, our plans remain to execute 2,980 real estate projects in total, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels and 120 store relocations. \n As a reminder, we expect approximately 800 of our new stores in 2022 to be in our larger 8,500 square foot store format as we respond to our customers' desire for even wider product selection. With about 1,200 square feet of additional selling space compared to a traditional store, these larger formats allow for expanded high-capacity cooler counts; an extended queue line; and a broader product assortment, including NCI, our larger health and beauty offering; and produce in many stores. \n Importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the unit economics of this larger format. While the initial cost to open these larger stores is about $300,000, including fixed assets and working capital, we are seeing increased sales productivity and continue to generate returns in the range of 20% to 22%. \n In addition to our planned Dollar General and pOpshelf growth in 2022 and included in our total new store goal, we are also very excited about our plans to expand internationally: the goal of opening up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of 2022. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust. With more U.S. brick-and-mortar stores than any retailer, we are excited about our ability to capture significant growth opportunities in the years ahead. \n Next, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our physical footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance convenience and access for customers. Our efforts remain centered around building engagement across our digital properties, including our mobile app. We ended Q1 with more than 4 million monthly active users on the app and expect this number to grow as we look to further enhance our digital offerings. \n Our partnership with DoorDash continues to yield strong results as we look to extend the value offering of Dollar General, combined with the convenience of same-day delivery in an hour or less. This offering was available in about 11,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with the early results, including better-than-expected customer trial, strong repurchase rates, high levels of sales incrementality and a broadening of our customer base. \n In addition, we are excited about the continued growth of our Dollar General Media Network, which is becoming increasingly more relevant in connecting our participating brand partners with over 90% of our unique customer base. After establishing the foundation over the last few years, we are poised to meaningfully grow this business in 2022 and beyond as we expand the program and further enhance the value proposition for customers and brand partners while increasing the overall net financial benefit for the business. \n Most recently, we launched a suite of financial offerings as we look to further leverage our unique footprint to provide our customers with additional services they want and need. These services include a spendwell-branded bank account and debit card offering; a buy now, pay later pilot in select number of stores; and a test of a rewards redemption program. These offerings aim to provide greater financial empowerment for customers while driving incremental traffic and profitability within our stores. \n Overall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience, and we are pleased with the growing engagement we are seeing across our digital properties. \n Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. We have a clear and defined process to control spending which continues to govern our disciplined approach to spending decisions. This zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do while reinforcing our cost control mindset. \n Our Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. The first phase of Fast Track consisted of both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which has led to the more efficient stocking of our stores. The second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates. \n Self-checkout was available in more than 8,000 stores at the end of Q1, and we continue to be pleased with our results, including strong customer adoption rates. As a result of the success of self-checkout and popularity with customers, we have recently launched a pilot of stores that are entirely self-checkout. While our associates will remain available to assist customers, if needed, in these stores, we believe this 100% self-checkout option could further enhance the convenience proposition while enabling our associates to dedicate even more time to serving customers. We plan to ultimately test this layout in about 200 stores throughout 2022. \n Looking ahead, we are on track to expand our self-checkout offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the year as we look to further extend our position as an innovative leader in small-box discount retail. \n Moving forward, the next phase of Fast Track consists of increasing our utilization of emerging technology and data strategies which includes putting new digital tools in the hands of our field leaders. When combined with our data-driven inventory management, we believe these efforts will reduce store workload and drive greater efficiencies for our retail associates and leaders. \n I also want to highlight our growing private fleet, which consisted of more than 950 tractors at the end of Q1 as compared to over 700 tractors at the end of 2021. As a reminder, we are focused on significantly expanding our private fleet in 2022 as we plan to more than double the number of tractors from 2021, which we expect will account for approximately 40% of our outbound transportation fleet by the end of the year. As a result of this planned growth, we believe our private fleet will become an increasingly significant competitive advantage as it gives us greater operational control within our own supply chain while further optimizing our cost structure. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator. \n Our fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion. As a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs and opportunities for personal and professional development and ultimately career advancement. To that end, we recently began offering access to 100% employer-paid college degree programs for all full-time employees. \n In addition, all Dollar General employees and their immediate family members now have access to online, on-demand, self-paced learning platform that provides college-level general education courses at no cost to them, which is intended to help initiate or further their education journey and development. These programs are in addition to several other existing development programs, including our fully paid private fleet driver training program, as well as the ability to earn undergraduate credits through the American Council on Education upon completion of our store manager training program. We continue to innovate on additional development opportunities for our teams to provide ongoing opportunities for career advancement, and in turn, meaningful wage growth. \n Our internal promotion pipeline remains robust as evidenced by internal placement rates of more than 75% at or above the lead sales associate position. Additionally, approximately 15% of our private fleet team began their careers with us in either a store or distribution center. \n We continue to monitor our competitive position in the market closely, and we are pleased with our turnover rates, staffing levels and applicant flow, further validating our belief that we are taking the right actions to attract and retain talent. We believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent. \n Overall, we continue to make great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives, and we are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders. \n In closing, I am proud of the team's strong performance, and we are pleased with our great start to the year. I want to thank our more than 164,000 employees for their hard work as we all focus on fulfilling our mission of serving others every day, and I am excited about our plans for the year ahead. \n With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. John, this is Jeff, and thank you for that question. As we think about health, we've been saying this for quite some time, the largest share donor we're seeing in our business certainly is from the drug channel. And so that's one of the reasons, as you've heard us say before, why we're leaning in here. And so certainly, with 30% more selling space and 400 additional items, we're really pleased to be in 1,800 stores and be in 4,000 by the end of the year. And what we're seeing in the customer's response is very good, and we're excited about what we're seeing, not only in her take rates, but also when you break down the basket.\n So when you think about Dollar General, I think the best way to think about this is this way. When you look at our mainstays, like home cleaning and paper where we have closer to a 10% share and when you think about this particular area where we're closer to a 4%, it really paints the opportunity for us to continue to grow share in this particular area. And as we've said before, we do classify this as consumable, but it has margins that are akin more to nonconsumable. And when you step back and you think about the larger footprint that we talk about, where 80% of our stores in 2022 will be in that larger 8,500 square foot footprint, it gives us the full theater to put this in place.\n So I think you see from -- why we're so excited, but also, I think you see the intentional nature of how we layer this into our strategic view of the business and how we look forward and around the corner. So I think you'll see more to come there. We're really excited about what we see. Thanks, Corey. This is Jeff. So in Mexico, I'm really pleased with what the team has been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time. I would tell you, we have assembled a fantastic team of retailers, and folks are really excited about joining the opportunity. \n So first and foremost, the team is incredibly impressive with decades of experience. That's the first point. The second point is, is that we continue to make great progress around learning how to serve this customer. And as we've mentioned before, we have a lot of analogs that gave us great confidence to even expand internationally from a lot of the performance and customers we serve along the border, which we've done historically incredibly well here at Dollar General.\n So as we learn more and more about that consumer, we're really excited about what we are able to offer her and tailor it to her needs and also really rely a lot on what we've been able to do so well here in the United States. So feel great about the assortment and the build that we're doing there, feel real good about the supply chain progress and then also on the real estate. In fact, we've been down there a couple of weeks ago and headed down there here shortly to continue to look at the sites and been very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our ability to be convenient and be that community-serving retailer that we are here in the U.S. and excited about what we're going to be able to do in Mexico. And we still feel real good about our initial expectation of up to 10 stores by the end of the year."

[Operator Instructions]\n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their commitment to serving our customers and their communities this year. I'm proud of the team's resilience and sense of purpose in fulfilling our mission of serving others. I was reminded again recently of the tremendous opportunity we have to serve as America's neighborhood general store as we celebrated the grand opening of our 20,000th store in Ellis, Texas. Our entire team takes great pride in serving the communities we call home with value and convenience every day.\n On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q4 performance as well as briefly sharing some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share our Q4 financial update and our financial guidance for 2024. And then I'll wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics in our execution across the business.\n Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales decreased 3.4% to $9.9 billion in Q4 compared to net sales of $10.2 billion in last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lapping sales of $678 million from the 53rd week in fiscal 2022. Our net sales performance was highlighted by accelerating market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as market share growth in dollars in nonconsumable product sales.\n Same-store sales grew 0.7% in Q4 and increased sequentially each period of the quarter, which we believe is a testament to the positive early impact of some of our Back to Basics work. The increase was driven by growth of nearly 4% in customer traffic, which was positive in all 3 periods of the quarter, and partially offset by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket.\n Additionally, the comp sales increase was driven entirely by our consumable category and was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. Customers are continuing to feel the impact of the last 2 years of inflation, which we believe is driving them to make trade-offs in the store. We see this manifested in the continued pressure on sales in discretionary categories as well as accelerated share growth and penetration in private brand sales.\n Our commitment to providing customers with value and convenience is as important as ever. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to our competitors and other classes of trade and are well positioned to help our customers stretch their dollar. As we look to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers in 2024, I want to provide a quick update on some of our plans.\n We executed more than 3,000 real estate projects in 2023, including 987 new stores, 129 relocations and 2,007 remodels. We expect to build on this momentum in 2024 as we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new store openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations. These store opening plans include 30 pOpshelf stores and up to 15 stores in Mexico, where we recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first store opening. We recently began shipping from pOpshelf-only distribution facility in Georgia, which will allow us to drive greater efficiencies in our existing traditional distribution network and better serve our pOpshelf stores.\n As a reminder, pOpshelf is comprised of primarily nonconsumable product categories and, as such, is more heavily impacted by a softer discretionary sales environment. As a result, we believe we are moving at an appropriate pace of openings for this year.\n We continue to believe that the pOpshelf concept provides an additional growth opportunity, but are cognizant of the near-term pressures impacting nonconsumable sales. We continue to diligently apply our learnings and refine our strategy and scaling of the business to drive higher returns.\n Finally, we have always prioritized going where the customer wants us to go. And we continue to hear from many of them regarding more fresh food options. Thanks to years of great work by our teams to add cooler doors to our stores while enabling the self-distribution of these products, we now have nearly 30 doors per store on average, with ongoing opportunities to add cooler doors and frozen and refrigerated items through our fresh initiative. In addition, we have fresh produce in more than 5,400 stores at the end of the year and are targeting up to 1,500 additional stores for produce in 2024.\n Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in Q4, which I will discuss in more details later. And we are excited about our plans for 2024. As we embark on our 85th year in business and with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned as a growth company that is privileged to be here for what matters for millions of customers across the country. We take this responsibility seriously and are committed to serving our customers and communities while developing and supporting our associates and creating long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly. \nKelly Dilts: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5%, a decrease of 138 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, lower inventory markups and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. Notably, year-over-year shrink headwinds continued to build during the year, increasing more than 100 basis points for both the fourth quarter and full year. We are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink in 2024, which Todd will discuss in more detail later in the call.\n Turning to SG&A. It was 23.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 189 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, including the remaining $50 million of our targeted labor investment as well as store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 37.9% to $580 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.9%, a decrease of 327 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $77 million compared to $75 million in last year's fourth quarter.\n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% and compares to 23.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes as well as lower state effective rate resulting from increased recognition of state tax credits.\n Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 38% to $1.83, which was at the higher end of our internal expectations. For the full year, EPS decreased 29% to $7.55, including an estimated negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from lapping the 53rd week and a negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from higher interest expense.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 3.5% compared to fiscal year 2022 and a decrease of 1.1% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 17% compared to last year and decreased 21% on a per store basis. I want to acknowledge the great work the team has done to reduce our inventory position this year. We've made significant progress optimizing our inventory mix and levels, and we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. As Todd will discuss in a few moments, we will continue to focus on inventory levels in 2024, including additional opportunities to reduce per store inventory.\n In 2023, the business generated cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion, an increase of 21% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, in line with our expectations and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $130 million. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making, including gains in customer traffic and market share, lower inventory levels and improving cash flow from operations.\n Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. While we continue to make progress in our Back to Basics work, the full benefits from these actions will not be realized in a single quarter, and we anticipate they will build as we move throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2024: net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same-store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and an EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. We currently anticipate an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.\n We expect a reduced level of capital spending as a percent of sales compared to prior year in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which we believe is appropriate to support our ongoing growth.\n Before I move on, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which we believe continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.\n With regard to shareholder returns this year, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share.\n Finally, to support reducing our debt leverage ratio and maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings, we do not plan to repurchase common stock this year under our Board-authorized repurchase program. Although as I mentioned, share repurchases remain a part of our future capital allocation strategy.\n Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2.\n Cash generation is always important, and we are focused on further improving cash flow as we move through 2024. We believe these actions, which are aligned with our capital allocation priorities, will continue to strengthen our overall financial position for 2024 and beyond.\n Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. As Todd noted, inflation continues to impact our customer as they make trade-offs in the aisle and we anticipate the related sales mix headwind to gross margin will continue in 2024. In addition, after multiple years of fewer markdowns, we expect the overall promotional environment in 2024 to revert to pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate this will result in higher promotional markdowns, which will offset the lower clearance markdowns compared to last year and we'll keep overall markdowns as a percent of sales in 2024 at a similar level to 2023. In addition, we expect shrink to be an ongoing headwind to gross margin in the first part of the year before the anticipated positive impact of our mitigation efforts begin to manifest in the back half of the year.\n Turning to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation as well as ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization. Looking at the quarterly SG&A cadence, while we expect to deleverage each quarter, we also expect sequential quarterly improvement in the year-over-year basis point comparison as we move through the year. In addition, we expect pressure in Q1 as we annualize some of the headwinds from 2023, including shrink and our investment in retail labor as well as pressure from markdowns, which we expect will have a different cadence than 2023, which was back half heavy.\n While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the specific Q1 headwinds, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales increase of 1.5% to 2% in the first quarter, with EPS in the range of approximately $1.50 to $1.60.\n In summary, we are confident in the long-term strategy for this company and believe we are well positioned to drive top and bottom line growth in the years ahead. In the near term, we are taking actions to strengthen our position to support long-term growth with our Back to Basics efforts with a particular focus on driving comp sales, gaining market share and reducing shrink.\n Over the long term, our underlying opportunities to grow operating margin are still in place, including shrink reduction, the DG Media Network, private brands, global sourcing, category management and inventory optimization, distribution and transportation efficiencies and our Save to Serve approach to controlling costs. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.\n We are pleased with our progress, and we are excited about our plans for 2024 as we continue to reinforce our foundation for future growth, while driving profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. We remain committed to our 4 operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low-cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\n To advance these priorities in the near term and following the period of evaluation of the challenges and opportunities in front of us, we have implemented a refresh approach to getting back to the basics to improve store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising.\n To better inform these efforts, the leadership team has spent a significant amount of time over the last couple of months directly engaging with our associates throughout the organization, including listening sessions in stores, distribution centers and our store support center. We also hosted more than 400 field leaders in Nashville in February, and then several of us spent time on the road with more than 1,000 additional leaders across the country. These sessions allowed us to follow up on the feedback we've received, share our action plans and commitments and align our expectations with our teams across the organization. We continue to prioritize this direct engagement with our associates and value the actionable feedback we gain to continue enhancing the way we support our teams and serve our customers, all while strengthening the sense of pride and purpose we all share at Dollar General.\n I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends with our customer. We completed the investment of $150 million in store labor during the fourth quarter, with the additional hours primarily focused on the 2 areas we discussed on our last quarterly call. First, we significantly increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores. These team members are dedicated to providing a friendly, welcome and positive checkout experience for our customers.\n Second, we take dedicated more labor to perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specialized inventory training in each store. This effort has been well received by our managers and their teams and has contributed to in-stock level improvements in our stores.\n As we entered 2024, we have also reduced the span of control for our district managers, adding more than 140 new districts and district managers. This significant investment in our field teams reduces the number of stores assigned to each district manager by approximately 15% and is designed to increase both the opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams as well as to drive consistency and execution across our store base.\n Finally, we've taken a fresh look at store-level tasks and activities and have taken significant action to make it easier to operate our stores. While we have made progress, we continue to focus on how we can enhance the overall customer and associate experience in our stores.\n With that in mind, we are making 3 changes to our self-checkout strategy this year. As a reminder, we currently have self-checkout options available in more than 14,000 stores. Although adoption rates for self-checkout have been high, we believe there is truly no substitute for an employee presence at the front end of the store to greet customers and provide excellent customer service, including at checkout. Importantly, when choosing our self-checkout solution, we implemented a product that is convertible from self-checkout to associate-assisted checkout. To that end, we have begun immediately converting some or all self-checkout registers to assisted-checkout options in approximately 9,000 stores. This is intended to drive traffic first to our staffed registers, with assisted-checkout options available as second or third options to reduce lines during high-volume times.\n Our second course of action will apply to all remaining stores with self-checkout, where we have begun limiting self-checkout to transactions consisting of 5 items or less.\n And finally, over the first half of the year, we plan to completely remove self-checkout from more than 300 of our highest shrink stores. Collectively, we believe these steps are in line with where the customer wants us to be, which includes increasing personal engagement with them at the store. Additionally, we believe these actions have the potential to have a material and positive impact on shrink as we move into the back half of the year and into 2025. The 2024 portion of this benefit as well as additional labor in these stores to devote to the checkout process is included in our guidance that Kelly provided earlier.\n Beyond our changes to self-checkout, we are also executing on a variety of other actions to reduce shrink this year, including inventory reduction efforts, where we see additional opportunity in 2024; SKU rationalization, which I'll discuss more momentarily; additional shrink incentive programs for our store managers to encourage and foster a greater sense of ownership; and the utilization of high-shrink planograms, whereby we will remove certain high-shrink items from high-shrink stores to target the greatest opportunity for improvement. While we anticipate a continuing headwind from shrink early this year, we believe our actions will have a significant mitigation impact in the back half of the year and into 2025.\n Overall, we believe these actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on-shelf availability and convenience; enhance the associate experience in our stores, including improved employee engagement and retention; and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink.\n Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. As a reminder, our top priority this year is to improve our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams are laser-focused on serving stores as their most direct customers and are pursuing several opportunities to drive higher OTIF levels. Since Q3, we have seen significant improvements in our on-time deliveries as well as customer service levels. In 2024, we will continue to pursue improvements by undertaking our first full-scale refresh of our sorting process and distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track sortation initiative in 2017.\n With the growth and evolution we have seen since that time, we are further updating the sorting process to improve our distribution flow while enabling our store teams to unload the truck and restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on-shelf availability for our customers and increased sales.\n In addition to improving OTIF rates, we have also been successful in reducing inventory and optimizing the flow within our supply chain. As we said we would last quarter, we have reduced the number of temporary warehouse facilities, exiting 5 buildings in 2023, with plans to exit 7 more in 2024. We will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities that are more complementary to some of our smaller permanent distribution centers, but by reducing the number of outside warehouses, we can lower costs and continue to improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain.\n As I mentioned earlier, we opened a pOpshelf-only distribution facility earlier this year to improve efficiencies, and we expect to open Dollar General distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado later this year as we continue to support our ongoing growth. As a result of our reduced inventory levels and optimization of existing distribution centers, we now expect to open the planned facility in Oregon at a date beyond 2024.\n We are pleased with the progress we've made in our supply chain and are confident in our ability to continue progressing toward our goals. Ultimately, these actions should enhance our ability to meet challenging demands and respond to the challenges within the supply chain as well as drive greater efficiencies and further improve experience for our store teams and customers.\n Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics in merchandising. Our team continues to prioritize delivering value to our customers while simplifying the work for our store teams and driving profitable sales growth. I want to echo Kelly in acknowledging the great work the team has done on inventory optimization and reduction. This has lowered our carrying costs, driven efficiencies across the supply chain and store base and positions us to better serve our customers. Importantly, we have been able to lower average inventory per store while improving our in-stock rates and driving higher comp sales growth. We expect to continue driving improvement in 2024 with several efforts already underway.\n We have begun actively reducing the number of SKUs we carry in our stores through our planogram reset process, and we expect net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs in our stores by the end of 2024. Notably, we have already turned off the majority of these SKUs, which will allow us to sell through the remaining inventory while seeking to minimize the amount of related clearance markdowns, which are contemplated in our 2024 guidance.\n Finally, our merchant teams have focused on reducing activity for store teams by reducing the number of floor stands and monthly endcap resets and increasing the number of products that go straight to the shelf, all which saves time in our stores and enhances the customer experience.\n As we wrap up this morning, I want to reiterate that we are laser-focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General and fulfilling our mission of serving others. I'm proud of the team's efforts over the last few months to identify gaps and opportunities, implement plans of action and deliver on our commitments that we make.\n We are moving with a sense of urgency and have made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. And while we are already seeing positive results from some of our actions, other efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit.\n With all that in mind, we are excited about the future of this business. We are working hard to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us to drive meaningful operational improvement in the near term and to deliver sustainable growth and value over the long term.\n I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their engagement and for their dedication to serving others every day. This team is energized and committed to our Back to Basics plan, and I'm excited about all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead.\n With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on the improvement. So Todd, I think it would be helpful if you could maybe speak to the top line and traffic self-help improvement that you're seeing, just given the volatile macro backdrop. So as you break down your 2024 comp guide, could you elaborate on the Back to Basics strategy? What's working today that supports the first quarter comp guidance relative to maybe incremental opportunity that you see potentially building throughout the year, particularly in the back half? \nTodd Vasos: Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. We're pretty pleased with what we've seen in our short run here on getting back to the basics. You can see it in our comps in Q4, you can see it in our traffic numbers and we can see it in our customer data as well. So all good signs that we're on track to where we want to get to, to get back to the basics here at Dollar General.\n In saying that, you saw the comp guide for Q1 at 1.5% to 2%. Obviously, that is a more robust comp than we've seen here for a better part of the year. And I think that really goes to the -- to a couple of things. One is our commitment and -- as well as our confidence in the Back to Basics work that's being done. Let me just quickly recap a couple of those so that you all can have confidence as I do and the team does here on why we believe.\n One is, we have done a lot of work in ensuring we've got the right amount of labor inside of our stores, $150 million in labor investments in 2023. I think most notably here as well is in Q4, the reallocation of that labor to areas that mean the most to our stores and to our customers. And so ensuring that we've got somebody at the front register to ring out 100% of the time, check, we're actually doing that, I believe, at a very high level now.\n Second of all, ensuring that we put labor in to keep our on-hand and perpetual inventory counts more accurate. We, through Q4, have implemented that program, including extensive training to make sure that we feel confident long term that it will be sticky in our stores. And so I would tell you that our stores and our store employees have applauded that labor investment. And we're already starting to see some of the early benefits from that on the shelf, meaning more product on time and in the shelf. So really great to see.\n Also, another big reason on the self-help side, as you indicated, that we feel confident in is that we worked hard in Q4. We've gone back and peeled the onion completely back on transportation and DC accuracy, so in our whole supply chain and then put it back together, believe it or not, in Q4. What we've seen by doing that is that we've seen our on-time rates tick up greatly. Matter of fact, in the last 4 to 5 weeks, we've seen a very, very consistent level just shy of our goals. And last week, for the first time, we hit our goals on both our fresh distribution as well as our traditional DC distribution. So great to see.\n And how that manifests itself at our store is any time we can be on time and more inflow in our stores, it gives our store the ability to be able to work what we call that 7-day workflow, which -- when they're able to do that, things run very, very smoothly inside of our stores. So more to come. While we're not 100% there, we are getting there on our transportation and our distribution pieces.\n And then the other pieces that really come into play here is in our merchandising areas. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we've already turned off 1,000 SKUs. We've got those turned off and already starting to burn down at store level. So we hope that we see our markdowns be somewhat limited there while we've got some markdowns, obviously, planned in 2024 to move through that product. This is really going to help the stores, 1,000 less SKUs that they have to deal with. And then at the same time, reducing the amount of floor stands coming up and other products that don't go right to the shelf. And by the way, it's going to be a substantial decrease. We -- the stores haven't seen that yet. That's coming in later in Q1 and into Q2. And by the way, it's over a 50% to 60% decrease over last year in those floor stands and those alternate items coming in. So again, a lot less work at the store.\n And then lastly, as it relates to, and I alluded to it in my prepared remarks, the rolltainer sort. We haven't done that since 2017. If you remember, back in 2017, when we did do that, it makes the putting of the product onto the shelf from the delivery 15% to 20% more -- does it faster. So we're able to execute it faster at store level. And what that does and how that manifests itself at store is, bottom line, is it gets product to the shelf faster. That increases sales, and it increases the productivity of our stockers inside that store.\n So more to come there. That's why we feel so bullish about what we've got coming and what we've already done. So we've done this before, Matt. We know how to do it, and we're getting at it, as you could tell with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of conviction here. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Todd, I wanted to ask you something that kind of puts together some of the comments you made as well as what Kelly said. I wanted to ask what's gone well since you joined, what's sort of taking longer. You mentioned some things need a little more attention. And as the construct of getting back to 7-plus margins, I think we talked about it theoretically by '25. Is that something that's still achievable? And listening to the finer points and some of what Kelly spoke about, like promotions being a little bit higher, it seems like shrink is about where you thought it would be. I don't know if you were trying to signal that it's a little worse that you're taking more action, but those type of puts and takes sort of what's gone well, what's not, and then something around the 7% in the future. \nTodd Vasos: Yes, Simeon, thank you for the question. I'll start and then pass it over to Kelly for that second piece.\n So what -- I've just covered a few of those what went well. But again, we feel good about those sales-driving activities and customer satisfaction activities that we've taken in our Back to Basics work. I believe that if you look at outside of shrink, and I'll get to that in a moment, here's how I would characterize where we are in getting back to the basics. I think this is a fundamental way to think about it.\n When we started this journey in middle October of last year, I'd say, unfortunately, we were about our own 10-yard line if you think about a football analogy. I'd say that as we exited Q4 and now entering Q1, we're just crossing the 35-yard line, our own 35-yard line. I feel that we are on the right track to cross over the 50-yard line as we move through Q1 and into Q2 and start to really look at how we drive further into '24 and into '25 and get into our own red zone, if you will.\n So that's how I'm looking at this. So some things are manifesting themselves and happening in real time very quickly at the store and through our customers' lens. Some will take a little longer. Now one of those things is shrink that's going to take a little longer. As you know, we take physical inventories once a year in our stores. So anything we started to do as of October of last year will take a year to manifest itself within the financials and, by the way, a little longer in some instances as things take hold, some quicker on the shrink side, some take a little longer.\n The great thing on the shrink side is that we know how to control this. We've done this before. Matter of fact, the individual that is in charge of operations now -- store operations, Steve Decker, Steve ran our shrink program for years here at Dollar General years ago and got it down to some of the lowest levels that -- historical lowest levels that we've seen in Dollar General pre-pandemic.\n We are squarely focused as we move through '25 and into '26 to get back to those pre-pandemic levels of shrink here at Dollar General. It's just going to take us a little time. But I'd tell you, when you look at what were -- the actions we're taking and, I would say, decisive actions, especially around self-checkout, taking self-checkout, if you will, the ability of self-checkout out of 9,000 of our stores immediately and turning them to assisted-check stands is really going to benefit us.\n We spent a little bit of money in Q4, and we looked at an AI solution. We brought a team in. The team was called Everseen, and it's an AI solution that monitors thousands -- hundreds of thousands of our self-checkout transactions. And we were able to see through AI what has transpired over the course of many months of transaction data at self-checkout.\n And what we're able to see was how much shrink -- true shrink we've had, both purpose shrink, unfortunately, and inadvertent shrink by items not being scanned properly or thinking they scanned it and didn't. Long story here to say, we've made decisions based on that AI activity to pull out in 9,000 stores and go to that assisted-check stand. That should immediately do a lot for us. Putting somebody at the front end of the store, we did in October immediate -- will help our shrink.\n And then lastly, inventory control is going to help our shrink tremendously. I'm an own operator, going way back into the '80s as a System Manager, Store Manager, District Manager, VP of Operations. And I would tell you that any time you have too much inventory in the store, you've got too much shrink and damages. And damages, by the way, is just known shrink. And so more to come. I believe we're getting our arms around everything and feel very confident about where we're going.\n And Kelly? \nKelly Dilts: Yes. No, I think Todd told you all the reasons that we really believe that we're strengthening our foundation for long-term growth. And we really believe that this business is going to return to 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the long term.\n As we move past some of the significant headwinds that Todd just talked about and getting back to all the mitigating actions that we're doing to combat those headwinds, we still have a lot of really good fundamentals in this business even with where we are and they're only going to get better. We're seeing momentum and growing share. We're growing traffic. We're starting to see healthy comps again, all the while, we've been generating a lot of cash flow. So this model is absolutely intact.\n And when we think about it, we've still got a long runway for growth. We think 700 and 900 stores are certainly still in our future. We've got a lot of remodel progress that we have on our plates as well. And that, as you know, contributes 150 to 200 basis points of comp contribution, so still really solid there. And we've got a lot of long-term drivers, some new, which Todd just talked about, making sure that we're reducing shrink. The inventory optimization gives us a lot of efficiencies, both in the store and in the distribution centers.\n But then we have those long-term drivers that we've had in place for a while and continue to benefit of, the DG Media Network, private brands, the global sourcing, category management, all of those things that we've had for a while are certainly still in place. And with that, we expect to continue to generate cash and are looking forward to being able to return that cash back to shareholders, not only through the dividend, which we're doing now, but also through share repurchases over the long term.\n So lots of reasons to believe back in that 10% to 10% EPS growth, and we feel good about the future. \nOperator: Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. \nJohn Heinbockel: Todd, I wonder if you can address the mini-market format, your thoughts on potential -- how many stores you think you could have if we're talking several thousands. And then remind us of the economics of that. I know it's relatively new. But when you think about whether it's sales per store, sales per foot, 4-wall margins, how that might look versus other formats that you use? \nTodd Vasos: Sure. Thanks for the question, John. And you and I have been talking about fresh and about these type of stores for quite a while. And I would tell you, when we put into place here years ago, our ability to grow cooler count, to grow fresh produce, the way we have over the years very methodically to be profitable at it as well as then enabling all of that and soon to be produced in the near future into self-distribution, I would tell you that we feel very good about that.\n Then as you think about municipalities across this country that are in food deserts and/or looking for help in more fresh options, that mini market, as you indicated, our DG Market is really a lifesaver for those areas and a true lifeline for those areas where the grocery have left years ago, and we're there and can be there to help them.\n So we believe in that concept greatly. And as you look at the economics, and I'll pass it over to Kelly to add a little bit more color to it. But I would tell you that we like the sales economics there. We do like the 4-wall profitability that's thrown off by that. As we continue to look at balancing it, I would tell you there are thousands of opportunities for that box across the U.S.\n Kelly? \nKelly Dilts: That's right now and I think Todd hit on most of it. We really like the IRR. They're certainly at the upper end of what we expect from new stores and a payback of less than 2 years. We like the top line and the flow-through on the operating margin, and the 4-wall is strong. So we think it hits all cylinders. It's great for the business, but as Todd alluded to, it's also great for our customer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So I have 2 related questions to gross margins. So Kelly, you commented on your expectation for the promotional backdrop to revert to pre-pandemic levels. Just curious if you're seeing any changes in the promotional backdrop today or whether that's just an expectation for the balance of the year. And then just on gross margins, we heard a lot about the headwinds. But just wanted any granularity in terms of whether you expect gross margins to be up or down as we think about '24. \nTodd Vasos: Rupesh, let me start, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. Yes, as we look out into 2024, we do believe that the promotional environment will have an uptick here. We believe that it will revert closer to where pre-pandemic levels were. In 2023, we saw an increase as well. So this isn't an immediate left- or right-hand turn here. This is what we had anticipated, quite frankly, over the last couple of years that as we enter '24, we would probably start to see this. And by the way, I think our CPG partners, and I'm sure you've seen, have signaled this for quite a while now in that they need to move units and through that, encourage, if you will, some of that promotional activity to occur.\n The great thing about Dollar General, we talked about the levels of markdown, but the great thing about Dollar General is that with our size and scale, we're able to get a tremendous amount of CPG help when it relates to this higher level of activity. And so our margins usually tend to be okay, if you will, as we move through these higher markdowns -- promotional markdowns. But what it also does right now, Rupesh, I believe, is it just gives that customer that's looking for more and more value right now. And by the way, this customer is getting healthier and healthier every day. We're seeing it. She's figuring out her expenses. I think you probably remember, I talked about this quite often. It takes her a few quarters to figure out when she gets a shock to the system. And unfortunately, this inflationary environment we've lived in for the last couple of years has been a shock and maybe even a double shock to her.\n But she's starting to figure it out. You can see it through the transaction data. You can see it on the unit side, and you can see it even on the mix side. She's starting to pick up a little bit more of that nonconsumable-type items, that discretionary item a little bit more each and every passing week that we see. So there's a lot of reason to believe that this markdown activity will actually help encourage her to get out and spend more at Dollar General at a time where she needs us most. \nKelly Dilts: Yes. And just to kind of give you a cadence just off of exactly what Todd was talking about, as we think about moving through the year, Q1 is certainly our [indiscernible] from a sales perspective. But as Todd talked about on the markdown side of things, it's really -- it's a cadence thing more than just being impactful on gross margin overall for the year. And so last year, our markdown cadence, because it was more clearance related, was back half heavy. This year, because we're leaning into the promotional cadence, just getting back to more normal rates, you'll see that spread a little bit more evenly over the quarters.\n The other thing that we're looking at is just annualizing the retail labor hour investment. And so that's going to put some pressure on Q1. And then the -- we talked about shrink being 100 basis points or more above in -- year-over-year in Q4. And so with that exit rate, you're going to see some pressure in the front half of the year as well.\n I think importantly, as we think about the cadence overall, the momentum of the actions that we are taking, we're certainly pleased with what we're seeing now, but that's going to continue to build. And we're going to see top line improve as we move through the quarter and a strong bottom line growth as we move into the back half of the year.\n If we think through just the components -- and back to your original question just on the gross margin piece, from a headwinds perspective, you've heard us talk a lot about shrink, but we do think with all of the actions that we're taking that we're going to be able to bend that trend as we move into the back half of the year and certainly start to see some benefits there. But really, as we move into 2025, we're going to see sales mix headwind probably all year as they make trade-off in the aisles, but as Todd alluded to, it's nice to see that we are starting to move that discretionary items as well.\n And then on the tailwind side, lots of work done in supply chain. You've heard us talk about the efficiencies there and just structural improvement on that. And the inventory reductions are going to help, again, with shrink, but also with damages. DG Media Network continues to grow. We continue to like what we see there as well as private brands. So those are kind of the components as we think about the margin.\n And then just a couple of things on SG&A. Obviously, retail labor has played into our baseline that it's little bit Q1 impact there, just based off of the annualization. And then the incentive compensation will pressure us throughout all of the quarters, and we call that out as a $0.50 headwind that we're estimating for the current -- for the 2024 year. And then depreciation cost increases over the prior year. So those are really the puts and takes as we think about the flow and just the different components of both gross margin and SG&A. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to talk a little bit more about inventory. I think the total inventory was up and with the decline in discretionary inventory, I think it means that the consumable inventory might have been up maybe 19% or 20%. So I was wondering if you could just talk about that, if that's related to SKU changes. And just in general, when do you expect to get into a normalized inventory position really across both categories? \nKelly Dilts: Yes. No, I think the teams have done a lot of nice work on inventory, and you're absolutely right on what you're thinking about as far as trajectory. I think that they've done a really good job here threading the needle. And so we're seeing both sides of that. We're seeing the nonconsumable side inventory drop on a per store basis. And to your point, we're seeing the consumables increase. But that's us getting improvements in our in-stock, which is helping to drive sales. So they're doing a good job of balancing both of those things.\n As we move into 2024, inventory continues to be a high priority for us. We see opportunity to reduce our inventory on a per store basis as we move through. And then as you know, as we do that, the benefits just continue for us. It lowers our carrier costs, and it continues to drive efficiencies both in the stores and in the distribution centers. It takes pressure off of both shrink and damages. And frankly, with the improved in-stocks, that just positions us better to serve our customers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: I just want to circle back a little bit on Simeon's question, but just looking at it from the margin angle. It looks like operating margins this year are going to finish in the high 5%, low 6%, if we back out the incentive accrual. So when you look back to pre-COVID, you guys were running in that, call it, high 7%, mid-8% range. Just curious when you look ahead, now that the business is starting to stabilize, how quickly you think you could get back to those levels? And when you look at the P&L, what are the key ingredients to get you there? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Chuck, thanks for the question. And I would tell you, what we feel good about right now is getting back to the basics here. All the work that we're doing, as I indicated, we're probably just crossing over that 35-yard line. And so a lot of moving parts yet, but I think you could tell by my voice, and I can tell you, if you were here in this building, you could see the enthusiasm and in our stores of what is starting to really start to take hold. And that is getting back to the fundamentals that have made this company successful over the years.\n And a lot of it, the majority of it is not recreating the wheel, as I've said last quarter. It's taking tried and true items as well as processes and procedures and ensuring compliance. It's that simple in many instances.\n Now some of these, though, unfortunately, that had gone awry in the last 12 to 18 months. We really need to take some time to get those back in line. So those -- some of those are margin related and those components of, but as those start to heal, shrink being the largest one of those, I believe that we'll be in a really good position, as Kelly indicated, especially to start delivering on that EPS growth of 10% plus. And that is really some of the good health of the business that would start to show up.\n I feel good about that long-term algorithm. I feel good about this business as good as I ever felt. And quite frankly, I believe we have more drivers at our disposal today on driving that top line than we've ever had in the past, especially around the fresh network that we've got, the fresh food as well as all the work that we've done on NCI over the years and nonconsumables. That is just waiting for the customer to come back in. And as I indicated earlier, we're starting to see glimmers of her starting to come back in to that discretionary side. And we stand ready, willing, able with inventory, fresh inventory to get that done. So stay tuned. You know me, we're not going to stand still. We're going to push hard and get this thing moving as fast as we can, and we're off to a great start already here. \nOperator: Our final question is from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. You've seen now positive traffic for 2 quarters in a row, I believe. I was curious to get your thoughts. And within your outlook, what's embedded for traffic and ticket within your guide? And then if you could also maybe just touch on what you're expecting ahead from a wage standpoint and what's embedded in your guide as well there? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, sure. I'll start and pass it over to Kelly. Yes, the very back half of Q3, we started to see some good glimmers of positive traffic. And then as we move through Q4, we saw that sequentially increase. And not that we're giving Q1 guidance, but that's continued into Q1. And so we feel very good about what we're seeing on that traffic side. And we believe, again, by all these actions we're taking on getting back to the basics should manifest itself in a strong traffic growth as we continue to move into the quarters ahead. And that's why the comp guidance that we gave is so important because we believe that we can see that positive traffic.\n Not only that, but all the work that we're doing to get back to basics here, get in stock not only helps that traffic. But what we're starting to see is -- and gives us confidence is that for the first time in many quarters, we're starting to see the trade down come back in. And we hadn't seen that for a few quarters. And quite frankly, it's been across every cohort, a customer that we track. So not only that higher income, all the way down to the lower income, we're seeing share gains. So great to see that. That means the work that we're doing is resonating and should also mean and manifest itself into long-term growth on that top line. \nKelly Dilts: Absolutely right. And then on the wage side of things, I'll tell you, we feel really good about our wages. We've increased wages almost 30% since 2019 and feel we're in a good position there. We're not seeing a lot of stress on the wage front. So a more normalized annual wage growth is what we're expecting. And then with all of the investments that we've made in the labor hours, we feel like we are well positioned on that front in 2024. And all of that's considered in the guidance that we gave. So feel good about that as well. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our associates for their commitment to serving our customers and their communities this year. I'm proud of the team's resilience and sense of purpose in fulfilling our mission of serving others. I was reminded again recently of the tremendous opportunity we have to serve as America's neighborhood general store as we celebrated the grand opening of our 20,000th store in Ellis, Texas. Our entire team takes great pride in serving the communities we call home with value and convenience every day.\n On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q4 performance as well as briefly sharing some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share our Q4 financial update and our financial guidance for 2024. And then I'll wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics in our execution across the business.\n Turning to our fourth quarter performance. Net sales decreased 3.4% to $9.9 billion in Q4 compared to net sales of $10.2 billion in last year's fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lapping sales of $678 million from the 53rd week in fiscal 2022. Our net sales performance was highlighted by accelerating market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as market share growth in dollars in nonconsumable product sales.\n Same-store sales grew 0.7% in Q4 and increased sequentially each period of the quarter, which we believe is a testament to the positive early impact of some of our Back to Basics work. The increase was driven by growth of nearly 4% in customer traffic, which was positive in all 3 periods of the quarter, and partially offset by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket.\n Additionally, the comp sales increase was driven entirely by our consumable category and was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. Customers are continuing to feel the impact of the last 2 years of inflation, which we believe is driving them to make trade-offs in the store. We see this manifested in the continued pressure on sales in discretionary categories as well as accelerated share growth and penetration in private brand sales.\n Our commitment to providing customers with value and convenience is as important as ever. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to our competitors and other classes of trade and are well positioned to help our customers stretch their dollar. As we look to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers in 2024, I want to provide a quick update on some of our plans.\n We executed more than 3,000 real estate projects in 2023, including 987 new stores, 129 relocations and 2,007 remodels. We expect to build on this momentum in 2024 as we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new store openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations. These store opening plans include 30 pOpshelf stores and up to 15 stores in Mexico, where we recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our first store opening. We recently began shipping from pOpshelf-only distribution facility in Georgia, which will allow us to drive greater efficiencies in our existing traditional distribution network and better serve our pOpshelf stores.\n As a reminder, pOpshelf is comprised of primarily nonconsumable product categories and, as such, is more heavily impacted by a softer discretionary sales environment. As a result, we believe we are moving at an appropriate pace of openings for this year.\n We continue to believe that the pOpshelf concept provides an additional growth opportunity, but are cognizant of the near-term pressures impacting nonconsumable sales. We continue to diligently apply our learnings and refine our strategy and scaling of the business to drive higher returns.\n Finally, we have always prioritized going where the customer wants us to go. And we continue to hear from many of them regarding more fresh food options. Thanks to years of great work by our teams to add cooler doors to our stores while enabling the self-distribution of these products, we now have nearly 30 doors per store on average, with ongoing opportunities to add cooler doors and frozen and refrigerated items through our fresh initiative. In addition, we have fresh produce in more than 5,400 stores at the end of the year and are targeting up to 1,500 additional stores for produce in 2024.\n Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made in Q4, which I will discuss in more details later. And we are excited about our plans for 2024. As we embark on our 85th year in business and with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned as a growth company that is privileged to be here for what matters for millions of customers across the country. We take this responsibility seriously and are committed to serving our customers and communities while developing and supporting our associates and creating long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly. Thank you, Kelly. We remain committed to our 4 operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low-cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\n To advance these priorities in the near term and following the period of evaluation of the challenges and opportunities in front of us, we have implemented a refresh approach to getting back to the basics to improve store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising.\n To better inform these efforts, the leadership team has spent a significant amount of time over the last couple of months directly engaging with our associates throughout the organization, including listening sessions in stores, distribution centers and our store support center. We also hosted more than 400 field leaders in Nashville in February, and then several of us spent time on the road with more than 1,000 additional leaders across the country. These sessions allowed us to follow up on the feedback we've received, share our action plans and commitments and align our expectations with our teams across the organization. We continue to prioritize this direct engagement with our associates and value the actionable feedback we gain to continue enhancing the way we support our teams and serve our customers, all while strengthening the sense of pride and purpose we all share at Dollar General.\n I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends with our customer. We completed the investment of $150 million in store labor during the fourth quarter, with the additional hours primarily focused on the 2 areas we discussed on our last quarterly call. First, we significantly increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores. These team members are dedicated to providing a friendly, welcome and positive checkout experience for our customers.\n Second, we take dedicated more labor to perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specialized inventory training in each store. This effort has been well received by our managers and their teams and has contributed to in-stock level improvements in our stores.\n As we entered 2024, we have also reduced the span of control for our district managers, adding more than 140 new districts and district managers. This significant investment in our field teams reduces the number of stores assigned to each district manager by approximately 15% and is designed to increase both the opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams as well as to drive consistency and execution across our store base.\n Finally, we've taken a fresh look at store-level tasks and activities and have taken significant action to make it easier to operate our stores. While we have made progress, we continue to focus on how we can enhance the overall customer and associate experience in our stores.\n With that in mind, we are making 3 changes to our self-checkout strategy this year. As a reminder, we currently have self-checkout options available in more than 14,000 stores. Although adoption rates for self-checkout have been high, we believe there is truly no substitute for an employee presence at the front end of the store to greet customers and provide excellent customer service, including at checkout. Importantly, when choosing our self-checkout solution, we implemented a product that is convertible from self-checkout to associate-assisted checkout. To that end, we have begun immediately converting some or all self-checkout registers to assisted-checkout options in approximately 9,000 stores. This is intended to drive traffic first to our staffed registers, with assisted-checkout options available as second or third options to reduce lines during high-volume times.\n Our second course of action will apply to all remaining stores with self-checkout, where we have begun limiting self-checkout to transactions consisting of 5 items or less.\n And finally, over the first half of the year, we plan to completely remove self-checkout from more than 300 of our highest shrink stores. Collectively, we believe these steps are in line with where the customer wants us to be, which includes increasing personal engagement with them at the store. Additionally, we believe these actions have the potential to have a material and positive impact on shrink as we move into the back half of the year and into 2025. The 2024 portion of this benefit as well as additional labor in these stores to devote to the checkout process is included in our guidance that Kelly provided earlier.\n Beyond our changes to self-checkout, we are also executing on a variety of other actions to reduce shrink this year, including inventory reduction efforts, where we see additional opportunity in 2024; SKU rationalization, which I'll discuss more momentarily; additional shrink incentive programs for our store managers to encourage and foster a greater sense of ownership; and the utilization of high-shrink planograms, whereby we will remove certain high-shrink items from high-shrink stores to target the greatest opportunity for improvement. While we anticipate a continuing headwind from shrink early this year, we believe our actions will have a significant mitigation impact in the back half of the year and into 2025.\n Overall, we believe these actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on-shelf availability and convenience; enhance the associate experience in our stores, including improved employee engagement and retention; and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink.\n Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. As a reminder, our top priority this year is to improve our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams are laser-focused on serving stores as their most direct customers and are pursuing several opportunities to drive higher OTIF levels. Since Q3, we have seen significant improvements in our on-time deliveries as well as customer service levels. In 2024, we will continue to pursue improvements by undertaking our first full-scale refresh of our sorting process and distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track sortation initiative in 2017.\n With the growth and evolution we have seen since that time, we are further updating the sorting process to improve our distribution flow while enabling our store teams to unload the truck and restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on-shelf availability for our customers and increased sales.\n In addition to improving OTIF rates, we have also been successful in reducing inventory and optimizing the flow within our supply chain. As we said we would last quarter, we have reduced the number of temporary warehouse facilities, exiting 5 buildings in 2023, with plans to exit 7 more in 2024. We will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities that are more complementary to some of our smaller permanent distribution centers, but by reducing the number of outside warehouses, we can lower costs and continue to improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain.\n As I mentioned earlier, we opened a pOpshelf-only distribution facility earlier this year to improve efficiencies, and we expect to open Dollar General distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado later this year as we continue to support our ongoing growth. As a result of our reduced inventory levels and optimization of existing distribution centers, we now expect to open the planned facility in Oregon at a date beyond 2024.\n We are pleased with the progress we've made in our supply chain and are confident in our ability to continue progressing toward our goals. Ultimately, these actions should enhance our ability to meet challenging demands and respond to the challenges within the supply chain as well as drive greater efficiencies and further improve experience for our store teams and customers.\n Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics in merchandising. Our team continues to prioritize delivering value to our customers while simplifying the work for our store teams and driving profitable sales growth. I want to echo Kelly in acknowledging the great work the team has done on inventory optimization and reduction. This has lowered our carrying costs, driven efficiencies across the supply chain and store base and positions us to better serve our customers. Importantly, we have been able to lower average inventory per store while improving our in-stock rates and driving higher comp sales growth. We expect to continue driving improvement in 2024 with several efforts already underway.\n We have begun actively reducing the number of SKUs we carry in our stores through our planogram reset process, and we expect net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs in our stores by the end of 2024. Notably, we have already turned off the majority of these SKUs, which will allow us to sell through the remaining inventory while seeking to minimize the amount of related clearance markdowns, which are contemplated in our 2024 guidance.\n Finally, our merchant teams have focused on reducing activity for store teams by reducing the number of floor stands and monthly endcap resets and increasing the number of products that go straight to the shelf, all which saves time in our stores and enhances the customer experience.\n As we wrap up this morning, I want to reiterate that we are laser-focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General and fulfilling our mission of serving others. I'm proud of the team's efforts over the last few months to identify gaps and opportunities, implement plans of action and deliver on our commitments that we make.\n We are moving with a sense of urgency and have made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. And while we are already seeing positive results from some of our actions, other efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit.\n With all that in mind, we are excited about the future of this business. We are working hard to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us to drive meaningful operational improvement in the near term and to deliver sustainable growth and value over the long term.\n I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their engagement and for their dedication to serving others every day. This team is energized and committed to our Back to Basics plan, and I'm excited about all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead.\n With that, operator, I'd now like to open the lines for questions. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. We're pretty pleased with what we've seen in our short run here on getting back to the basics. You can see it in our comps in Q4, you can see it in our traffic numbers and we can see it in our customer data as well. So all good signs that we're on track to where we want to get to, to get back to the basics here at Dollar General.\n In saying that, you saw the comp guide for Q1 at 1.5% to 2%. Obviously, that is a more robust comp than we've seen here for a better part of the year. And I think that really goes to the -- to a couple of things. One is our commitment and -- as well as our confidence in the Back to Basics work that's being done. Let me just quickly recap a couple of those so that you all can have confidence as I do and the team does here on why we believe.\n One is, we have done a lot of work in ensuring we've got the right amount of labor inside of our stores, $150 million in labor investments in 2023. I think most notably here as well is in Q4, the reallocation of that labor to areas that mean the most to our stores and to our customers. And so ensuring that we've got somebody at the front register to ring out 100% of the time, check, we're actually doing that, I believe, at a very high level now.\n Second of all, ensuring that we put labor in to keep our on-hand and perpetual inventory counts more accurate. We, through Q4, have implemented that program, including extensive training to make sure that we feel confident long term that it will be sticky in our stores. And so I would tell you that our stores and our store employees have applauded that labor investment. And we're already starting to see some of the early benefits from that on the shelf, meaning more product on time and in the shelf. So really great to see.\n Also, another big reason on the self-help side, as you indicated, that we feel confident in is that we worked hard in Q4. We've gone back and peeled the onion completely back on transportation and DC accuracy, so in our whole supply chain and then put it back together, believe it or not, in Q4. What we've seen by doing that is that we've seen our on-time rates tick up greatly. Matter of fact, in the last 4 to 5 weeks, we've seen a very, very consistent level just shy of our goals. And last week, for the first time, we hit our goals on both our fresh distribution as well as our traditional DC distribution. So great to see.\n And how that manifests itself at our store is any time we can be on time and more inflow in our stores, it gives our store the ability to be able to work what we call that 7-day workflow, which -- when they're able to do that, things run very, very smoothly inside of our stores. So more to come. While we're not 100% there, we are getting there on our transportation and our distribution pieces.\n And then the other pieces that really come into play here is in our merchandising areas. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we've already turned off 1,000 SKUs. We've got those turned off and already starting to burn down at store level. So we hope that we see our markdowns be somewhat limited there while we've got some markdowns, obviously, planned in 2024 to move through that product. This is really going to help the stores, 1,000 less SKUs that they have to deal with. And then at the same time, reducing the amount of floor stands coming up and other products that don't go right to the shelf. And by the way, it's going to be a substantial decrease. We -- the stores haven't seen that yet. That's coming in later in Q1 and into Q2. And by the way, it's over a 50% to 60% decrease over last year in those floor stands and those alternate items coming in. So again, a lot less work at the store.\n And then lastly, as it relates to, and I alluded to it in my prepared remarks, the rolltainer sort. We haven't done that since 2017. If you remember, back in 2017, when we did do that, it makes the putting of the product onto the shelf from the delivery 15% to 20% more -- does it faster. So we're able to execute it faster at store level. And what that does and how that manifests itself at store is, bottom line, is it gets product to the shelf faster. That increases sales, and it increases the productivity of our stockers inside that store.\n So more to come there. That's why we feel so bullish about what we've got coming and what we've already done. So we've done this before, Matt. We know how to do it, and we're getting at it, as you could tell with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of conviction here. Yes, Simeon, thank you for the question. I'll start and then pass it over to Kelly for that second piece.\n So what -- I've just covered a few of those what went well. But again, we feel good about those sales-driving activities and customer satisfaction activities that we've taken in our Back to Basics work. I believe that if you look at outside of shrink, and I'll get to that in a moment, here's how I would characterize where we are in getting back to the basics. I think this is a fundamental way to think about it.\n When we started this journey in middle October of last year, I'd say, unfortunately, we were about our own 10-yard line if you think about a football analogy. I'd say that as we exited Q4 and now entering Q1, we're just crossing the 35-yard line, our own 35-yard line. I feel that we are on the right track to cross over the 50-yard line as we move through Q1 and into Q2 and start to really look at how we drive further into '24 and into '25 and get into our own red zone, if you will.\n So that's how I'm looking at this. So some things are manifesting themselves and happening in real time very quickly at the store and through our customers' lens. Some will take a little longer. Now one of those things is shrink that's going to take a little longer. As you know, we take physical inventories once a year in our stores. So anything we started to do as of October of last year will take a year to manifest itself within the financials and, by the way, a little longer in some instances as things take hold, some quicker on the shrink side, some take a little longer.\n The great thing on the shrink side is that we know how to control this. We've done this before. Matter of fact, the individual that is in charge of operations now -- store operations, Steve Decker, Steve ran our shrink program for years here at Dollar General years ago and got it down to some of the lowest levels that -- historical lowest levels that we've seen in Dollar General pre-pandemic.\n We are squarely focused as we move through '25 and into '26 to get back to those pre-pandemic levels of shrink here at Dollar General. It's just going to take us a little time. But I'd tell you, when you look at what were -- the actions we're taking and, I would say, decisive actions, especially around self-checkout, taking self-checkout, if you will, the ability of self-checkout out of 9,000 of our stores immediately and turning them to assisted-check stands is really going to benefit us.\n We spent a little bit of money in Q4, and we looked at an AI solution. We brought a team in. The team was called Everseen, and it's an AI solution that monitors thousands -- hundreds of thousands of our self-checkout transactions. And we were able to see through AI what has transpired over the course of many months of transaction data at self-checkout.\n And what we're able to see was how much shrink -- true shrink we've had, both purpose shrink, unfortunately, and inadvertent shrink by items not being scanned properly or thinking they scanned it and didn't. Long story here to say, we've made decisions based on that AI activity to pull out in 9,000 stores and go to that assisted-check stand. That should immediately do a lot for us. Putting somebody at the front end of the store, we did in October immediate -- will help our shrink.\n And then lastly, inventory control is going to help our shrink tremendously. I'm an own operator, going way back into the '80s as a System Manager, Store Manager, District Manager, VP of Operations. And I would tell you that any time you have too much inventory in the store, you've got too much shrink and damages. And damages, by the way, is just known shrink. And so more to come. I believe we're getting our arms around everything and feel very confident about where we're going.\n And Kelly? Sure. Thanks for the question, John. And you and I have been talking about fresh and about these type of stores for quite a while. And I would tell you, when we put into place here years ago, our ability to grow cooler count, to grow fresh produce, the way we have over the years very methodically to be profitable at it as well as then enabling all of that and soon to be produced in the near future into self-distribution, I would tell you that we feel very good about that.\n Then as you think about municipalities across this country that are in food deserts and/or looking for help in more fresh options, that mini market, as you indicated, our DG Market is really a lifesaver for those areas and a true lifeline for those areas where the grocery have left years ago, and we're there and can be there to help them.\n So we believe in that concept greatly. And as you look at the economics, and I'll pass it over to Kelly to add a little bit more color to it. But I would tell you that we like the sales economics there. We do like the 4-wall profitability that's thrown off by that. As we continue to look at balancing it, I would tell you there are thousands of opportunities for that box across the U.S.\n Kelly? Rupesh, let me start, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. Yes, as we look out into 2024, we do believe that the promotional environment will have an uptick here. We believe that it will revert closer to where pre-pandemic levels were. In 2023, we saw an increase as well. So this isn't an immediate left- or right-hand turn here. This is what we had anticipated, quite frankly, over the last couple of years that as we enter '24, we would probably start to see this. And by the way, I think our CPG partners, and I'm sure you've seen, have signaled this for quite a while now in that they need to move units and through that, encourage, if you will, some of that promotional activity to occur.\n The great thing about Dollar General, we talked about the levels of markdown, but the great thing about Dollar General is that with our size and scale, we're able to get a tremendous amount of CPG help when it relates to this higher level of activity. And so our margins usually tend to be okay, if you will, as we move through these higher markdowns -- promotional markdowns. But what it also does right now, Rupesh, I believe, is it just gives that customer that's looking for more and more value right now. And by the way, this customer is getting healthier and healthier every day. We're seeing it. She's figuring out her expenses. I think you probably remember, I talked about this quite often. It takes her a few quarters to figure out when she gets a shock to the system. And unfortunately, this inflationary environment we've lived in for the last couple of years has been a shock and maybe even a double shock to her.\n But she's starting to figure it out. You can see it through the transaction data. You can see it on the unit side, and you can see it even on the mix side. She's starting to pick up a little bit more of that nonconsumable-type items, that discretionary item a little bit more each and every passing week that we see. So there's a lot of reason to believe that this markdown activity will actually help encourage her to get out and spend more at Dollar General at a time where she needs us most. Yes. Chuck, thanks for the question. And I would tell you, what we feel good about right now is getting back to the basics here. All the work that we're doing, as I indicated, we're probably just crossing over that 35-yard line. And so a lot of moving parts yet, but I think you could tell by my voice, and I can tell you, if you were here in this building, you could see the enthusiasm and in our stores of what is starting to really start to take hold. And that is getting back to the fundamentals that have made this company successful over the years.\n And a lot of it, the majority of it is not recreating the wheel, as I've said last quarter. It's taking tried and true items as well as processes and procedures and ensuring compliance. It's that simple in many instances.\n Now some of these, though, unfortunately, that had gone awry in the last 12 to 18 months. We really need to take some time to get those back in line. So those -- some of those are margin related and those components of, but as those start to heal, shrink being the largest one of those, I believe that we'll be in a really good position, as Kelly indicated, especially to start delivering on that EPS growth of 10% plus. And that is really some of the good health of the business that would start to show up.\n I feel good about that long-term algorithm. I feel good about this business as good as I ever felt. And quite frankly, I believe we have more drivers at our disposal today on driving that top line than we've ever had in the past, especially around the fresh network that we've got, the fresh food as well as all the work that we've done on NCI over the years and nonconsumables. That is just waiting for the customer to come back in. And as I indicated earlier, we're starting to see glimmers of her starting to come back in to that discretionary side. And we stand ready, willing, able with inventory, fresh inventory to get that done. So stay tuned. You know me, we're not going to stand still. We're going to push hard and get this thing moving as fast as we can, and we're off to a great start already here. Yes, sure. I'll start and pass it over to Kelly. Yes, the very back half of Q3, we started to see some good glimmers of positive traffic. And then as we move through Q4, we saw that sequentially increase. And not that we're giving Q1 guidance, but that's continued into Q1. And so we feel very good about what we're seeing on that traffic side. And we believe, again, by all these actions we're taking on getting back to the basics should manifest itself in a strong traffic growth as we continue to move into the quarters ahead. And that's why the comp guidance that we gave is so important because we believe that we can see that positive traffic.\n Not only that, but all the work that we're doing to get back to basics here, get in stock not only helps that traffic. But what we're starting to see is -- and gives us confidence is that for the first time in many quarters, we're starting to see the trade down come back in. And we hadn't seen that for a few quarters. And quite frankly, it's been across every cohort, a customer that we track. So not only that higher income, all the way down to the lower income, we're seeing share gains. So great to see that. That means the work that we're doing is resonating and should also mean and manifest itself into long-term growth on that top line."

            "name": "Kelly Dilts",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\n As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q4, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5%, a decrease of 138 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, lower inventory markups and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. Notably, year-over-year shrink headwinds continued to build during the year, increasing more than 100 basis points for both the fourth quarter and full year. We are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink in 2024, which Todd will discuss in more detail later in the call.\n Turning to SG&A. It was 23.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 189 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, including the remaining $50 million of our targeted labor investment as well as store occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation.\n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 37.9% to $580 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.9%, a decrease of 327 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $77 million compared to $75 million in last year's fourth quarter.\n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% and compares to 23.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes as well as lower state effective rate resulting from increased recognition of state tax credits.\n Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 38% to $1.83, which was at the higher end of our internal expectations. For the full year, EPS decreased 29% to $7.55, including an estimated negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from lapping the 53rd week and a negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points from higher interest expense.\n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 3.5% compared to fiscal year 2022 and a decrease of 1.1% on a per store basis. Notably, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 17% compared to last year and decreased 21% on a per store basis. I want to acknowledge the great work the team has done to reduce our inventory position this year. We've made significant progress optimizing our inventory mix and levels, and we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. As Todd will discuss in a few moments, we will continue to focus on inventory levels in 2024, including additional opportunities to reduce per store inventory.\n In 2023, the business generated cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion, an increase of 21% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, in line with our expectations and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\n During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payment of $130 million. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making, including gains in customer traffic and market share, lower inventory levels and improving cash flow from operations.\n Moving to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. While we continue to make progress in our Back to Basics work, the full benefits from these actions will not be realized in a single quarter, and we anticipate they will build as we move throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect the following for 2024: net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same-store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and an EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. We currently anticipate an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.\n We expect a reduced level of capital spending as a percent of sales compared to prior year in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which we believe is appropriate to support our ongoing growth.\n Before I move on, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which we believe continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases.\n With regard to shareholder returns this year, our Board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share.\n Finally, to support reducing our debt leverage ratio and maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings, we do not plan to repurchase common stock this year under our Board-authorized repurchase program. Although as I mentioned, share repurchases remain a part of our future capital allocation strategy.\n Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2.\n Cash generation is always important, and we are focused on further improving cash flow as we move through 2024. We believe these actions, which are aligned with our capital allocation priorities, will continue to strengthen our overall financial position for 2024 and beyond.\n Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. As Todd noted, inflation continues to impact our customer as they make trade-offs in the aisle and we anticipate the related sales mix headwind to gross margin will continue in 2024. In addition, after multiple years of fewer markdowns, we expect the overall promotional environment in 2024 to revert to pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate this will result in higher promotional markdowns, which will offset the lower clearance markdowns compared to last year and we'll keep overall markdowns as a percent of sales in 2024 at a similar level to 2023. In addition, we expect shrink to be an ongoing headwind to gross margin in the first part of the year before the anticipated positive impact of our mitigation efforts begin to manifest in the back half of the year.\n Turning to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation as well as ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization. Looking at the quarterly SG&A cadence, while we expect to deleverage each quarter, we also expect sequential quarterly improvement in the year-over-year basis point comparison as we move through the year. In addition, we expect pressure in Q1 as we annualize some of the headwinds from 2023, including shrink and our investment in retail labor as well as pressure from markdowns, which we expect will have a different cadence than 2023, which was back half heavy.\n While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, given the specific Q1 headwinds, we are providing more specific detail on our expectations for the first quarter. To that end, we expect a comp sales increase of 1.5% to 2% in the first quarter, with EPS in the range of approximately $1.50 to $1.60.\n In summary, we are confident in the long-term strategy for this company and believe we are well positioned to drive top and bottom line growth in the years ahead. In the near term, we are taking actions to strengthen our position to support long-term growth with our Back to Basics efforts with a particular focus on driving comp sales, gaining market share and reducing shrink.\n Over the long term, our underlying opportunities to grow operating margin are still in place, including shrink reduction, the DG Media Network, private brands, global sourcing, category management and inventory optimization, distribution and transportation efficiencies and our Save to Serve approach to controlling costs. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.\n We are pleased with our progress, and we are excited about our plans for 2024 as we continue to reinforce our foundation for future growth, while driving profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Yes. No, I think Todd told you all the reasons that we really believe that we're strengthening our foundation for long-term growth. And we really believe that this business is going to return to 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the long term.\n As we move past some of the significant headwinds that Todd just talked about and getting back to all the mitigating actions that we're doing to combat those headwinds, we still have a lot of really good fundamentals in this business even with where we are and they're only going to get better. We're seeing momentum and growing share. We're growing traffic. We're starting to see healthy comps again, all the while, we've been generating a lot of cash flow. So this model is absolutely intact.\n And when we think about it, we've still got a long runway for growth. We think 700 and 900 stores are certainly still in our future. We've got a lot of remodel progress that we have on our plates as well. And that, as you know, contributes 150 to 200 basis points of comp contribution, so still really solid there. And we've got a lot of long-term drivers, some new, which Todd just talked about, making sure that we're reducing shrink. The inventory optimization gives us a lot of efficiencies, both in the store and in the distribution centers.\n But then we have those long-term drivers that we've had in place for a while and continue to benefit of, the DG Media Network, private brands, the global sourcing, category management, all of those things that we've had for a while are certainly still in place. And with that, we expect to continue to generate cash and are looking forward to being able to return that cash back to shareholders, not only through the dividend, which we're doing now, but also through share repurchases over the long term.\n So lots of reasons to believe back in that 10% to 10% EPS growth, and we feel good about the future. That's right now and I think Todd hit on most of it. We really like the IRR. They're certainly at the upper end of what we expect from new stores and a payback of less than 2 years. We like the top line and the flow-through on the operating margin, and the 4-wall is strong. So we think it hits all cylinders. It's great for the business, but as Todd alluded to, it's also great for our customer. Yes. And just to kind of give you a cadence just off of exactly what Todd was talking about, as we think about moving through the year, Q1 is certainly our [indiscernible] from a sales perspective. But as Todd talked about on the markdown side of things, it's really -- it's a cadence thing more than just being impactful on gross margin overall for the year. And so last year, our markdown cadence, because it was more clearance related, was back half heavy. This year, because we're leaning into the promotional cadence, just getting back to more normal rates, you'll see that spread a little bit more evenly over the quarters.\n The other thing that we're looking at is just annualizing the retail labor hour investment. And so that's going to put some pressure on Q1. And then the -- we talked about shrink being 100 basis points or more above in -- year-over-year in Q4. And so with that exit rate, you're going to see some pressure in the front half of the year as well.\n I think importantly, as we think about the cadence overall, the momentum of the actions that we are taking, we're certainly pleased with what we're seeing now, but that's going to continue to build. And we're going to see top line improve as we move through the quarter and a strong bottom line growth as we move into the back half of the year.\n If we think through just the components -- and back to your original question just on the gross margin piece, from a headwinds perspective, you've heard us talk a lot about shrink, but we do think with all of the actions that we're taking that we're going to be able to bend that trend as we move into the back half of the year and certainly start to see some benefits there. But really, as we move into 2025, we're going to see sales mix headwind probably all year as they make trade-off in the aisles, but as Todd alluded to, it's nice to see that we are starting to move that discretionary items as well.\n And then on the tailwind side, lots of work done in supply chain. You've heard us talk about the efficiencies there and just structural improvement on that. And the inventory reductions are going to help, again, with shrink, but also with damages. DG Media Network continues to grow. We continue to like what we see there as well as private brands. So those are kind of the components as we think about the margin.\n And then just a couple of things on SG&A. Obviously, retail labor has played into our baseline that it's little bit Q1 impact there, just based off of the annualization. And then the incentive compensation will pressure us throughout all of the quarters, and we call that out as a $0.50 headwind that we're estimating for the current -- for the 2024 year. And then depreciation cost increases over the prior year. So those are really the puts and takes as we think about the flow and just the different components of both gross margin and SG&A. Yes. No, I think the teams have done a lot of nice work on inventory, and you're absolutely right on what you're thinking about as far as trajectory. I think that they've done a really good job here threading the needle. And so we're seeing both sides of that. We're seeing the nonconsumable side inventory drop on a per store basis. And to your point, we're seeing the consumables increase. But that's us getting improvements in our in-stock, which is helping to drive sales. So they're doing a good job of balancing both of those things.\n As we move into 2024, inventory continues to be a high priority for us. We see opportunity to reduce our inventory on a per store basis as we move through. And then as you know, as we do that, the benefits just continue for us. It lowers our carrier costs, and it continues to drive efficiencies both in the stores and in the distribution centers. It takes pressure off of both shrink and damages. And frankly, with the improved in-stocks, that just positions us better to serve our customers. Absolutely right. And then on the wage side of things, I'll tell you, we feel really good about our wages. We've increased wages almost 30% since 2019 and feel we're in a good position there. We're not seeing a lot of stress on the wage front. So a more normalized annual wage growth is what we're expecting. And then with all of the investments that we've made in the labor hours, we feel like we are well positioned on that front in 2024. And all of that's considered in the guidance that we gave. So feel good about that as well."

[Operator Instructions] \n Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be back at Dollar General. I have a deep passion for this company and for the customers we are privileged to serve. I continue to believe in this model, our future growth prospects and our ability to deliver value and convenience for our customers, a positive experience for our employees, and long-term value for our shareholders.  \n We take our mission of serving others seriously and know that our customer is facing financial constraints and communities are looking for strong partners in a tough macroeconomic environment. Historically, we've met those challenges head-on and delivered for our customer. And we believe that we are well positioned to do so now.  \n In retail, one of the best ways to diagnose the state of the business is by looking at it through the eyes of the customer. And we know that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. \n We have spent the last several weeks taking a fresh look at all areas of our business as well as the challenges and opportunities in front of us. We believe that we have a good understanding of what we need to do to address those challenges and opportunities, and we're already taking action. To be clear, this is not about rebuilding a team or organization, but about refocusing efforts already underway. This is where I want to spend the majority of our time today.  \n I won't share all the details this morning but I want to provide an overview to highlight our focus on getting back to the basics in our stores, in our supply chain and within our merchandising. After that, Kelly and I will review our third quarter performance.  \n I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. As we drive improvement across our store footprint, we are doing so through the lens of our customers. As we have previously announced, we are investing approximately $150 million in store labor hours this year. After review, we continue to believe this level of investment is appropriate. But as we do with every dollar we invest, we must ensure we are spending it to drive the greatest return, which means we are directly helping our store teams support our customers.  \n With that in mind, we have made the decision to redeploy labor hours away from smart teams and instead more directly to our store teams and a greater emphasis on customer service and store-level inventory management activities.  \n To that end, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus we believe will drive the greatest improvement in our stores. First, we plan to increase the employee presence at the front end of our stores and in particular, the checkout area. While self-checkout has contributed to the convenient proposition for our customers in certain stores, it does not reduce the importance of a friendly, helpful employee who is there to greet customers and assist while the checkout process is happening.  \n We have already begun by allocating more labor to front-end activities and clearly communicating our expectations around the visible presence of an associate at the front of our stores.  \n Second, we are reemphasizing the role played by our store teams in our perpetual inventory management process, which we believe will positively impact our on-shelf availability as well as our customers' convenience perception in our sales.  \n To do this, we are reallocating some of our labor investments toward store level inventory management processes, including an even greater focus on getting product on to our shelves more quickly. We are also reducing the span of control for our district managers which will provide more opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams and more consistency and execution across the store base.  \n As we take these actions and focus on the basics in our stores, we believe we will see improved retention at the store manager level where our turnover is currently higher than we like. And we know from experience that when we stabilize the store manager position, the entire store and team benefit, which ultimately drives a more positive experience for our customers as well as improved sales and shrink results.  \n Overall, we believe these actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service, on-shelf availability and convenience as well as sales, while our focus on the front end should also reduce shrink. These efforts also should help us improve employee engagement and retention.  \n Next, I want to talk about our supply chain. We have made significant progress recovering from the distribution capacity constraints that we had discussed late last year. However, through the lens of the customer, we see additional opportunity for improvement, particularly when it comes to serving our stores.  \n As we focus on getting back to the basics, the goal within our supply chain is for our truck deliveries to be on time and in full, or OTIF. As we continue to drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work for our store teams, which again results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates as well as an expectation of higher sales. \n I want to briefly highlight 3 areas of focus within our supply chain. First, we plan to better optimize the inventory within our distribution centers. As I will discuss in a moment, we are taking steps to reduce inventory, including SKU rationalization, which will allow for the more efficient movement of product for our distribution teams. Second, we are implementing productivity improvement initiatives within our distribution centers. While productivity rates have been impacted by both internal and external factors, we are working to mitigate or eliminate productivity impediments for our teams and control the things we can control.  \n These efforts include standardizing system configurations and optimizing the product layout in our facilities, while providing clear communication on performance standards and expectations.  \n And third, now that we're past the capacity constraints we experienced last year, we are reducing the number of temporary outside warehouse facilities being used to store product as inventory flows more effectively to and through our existing distribution centers.  \n By better leveraging these existing distribution centers and taking advantage of the new permanent facilities we have opened over the last year and those we will open next year, we believe we can significantly reduce the amount of temporary warehouse space needed.  \n As we've done historically, we likely will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities. However, we expect to transition out of many of them in Q4 and into next year. All of these actions within our supply chain should translate to lower distribution and transportation costs, better OTIF rates and better customer experience and all while improving sales results.\n Finally, I want to speak to our focus on fundamentals and merchandising. Once again, we reflected on our approach to the eyes of our customer. For our merchants, there is no greater priority than offering great value of the products our customers want and need.  \n Our customers are offering living paycheck to paycheck and continually tell us that value is the most important factor in their shopping decisions. I am pleased to note that we are in good shape when it comes to our everyday pricing. And we are right where we want to be in our price gaps with our competitors and classes of trade.  \n With that said, we are taking a hard look at what else we can do to drive value for our customers in this challenging economic environment, including highlighting private brands and other opportunities for savings as well as maximizing the effectiveness of any promotional activity to drive traffic and share growth.  \n Beyond these opportunities for our customers, we have also challenged our merchants to consider how they can drive simplification for our stores and supply chain as well with meaningful SKU rationalization as one of the most immediate areas of focus.  \n To that end, we have identified several opportunities to eliminate certain SKUs that have become less productive; first, by moving them out of our DCs and then ultimately to our stores to sell through. As our store teams have fewer SKUs to manage, we can lower our cost to serve, while driving higher inventory turns and higher sales of products that are most important to our customers.  We believe these actions will help further reduce inventory and shrink, while simplifying operations in both DCs and stores to drive greater efficiencies over the longer term.  \n We all know that driving traffic and market share are essential to long-term retail success. And while our results have been improving in these areas, we are still not satisfied with our current position. We believe we have identified actions that will pay dividends over both the short and long term, as we remain focused on driving profitable sales growth.  \n In summary, we are getting back to the basics here at Dollar General across all levels of the organization. Our desired results will not materialize overnight, but we believe we will see some early wins and continue to make progress towards executing on the fundamentals that have been foundational to our success over the past 85 years. As a result, we believe we will significantly enhance the customer experience while driving higher sales and increased profitability in our business.  \n Now before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to briefly discuss some of our top line results for Q3 as well as our 2024 real estate plans, which we announced earlier this morning.  \n Net sales in the third quarter increased 2.4% to $9.7 billion compared to net sales of $9.5 billion last year's third quarter. Within our net sales growth, we again grew market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as an overall non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales decreased 1.3% in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. The decrease was driven by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by units and included declines in all 4 product categories.  \n From an overall monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was very similar in all 3 months of the quarter. However, I'm pleased to note that customer traffic was positive in Q3. After starting the quarter slightly negative, traffic turned positive in the middle period and improved sequentially each period of the quarter.  \n Notably, Customer traffic and same-store sales continue to improve in November, which, although early in the quarter, we believe reflects early traction from our work on getting back to the basics here at Dollar General.  \n Turning to a quick update on our customer. During our most recent survey work, our customer continues to tell us they are feeling significant pressure on their spending which is supported by what we see in their behavior. Based on these trends and what we see in the macroeconomic environment, we anticipate customer spending may continue to be constrained as we head into 2024, especially in discretionary categories.  \n This further reinforces the importance of the work we're doing today, and we believe our unique value and convenient proposition is as relevant as ever in this marketplace. To that end, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth next year as we look to extend our offering to many more communities.  \n Real estate continues to be one of our core competencies and we remain pleased with the performance of our real estate projects. As a reminder, we monitor the following 5 metrics of our new store portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in 2 years or less; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 18% on average in 2024.  \n I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, are down modestly from our historical target of 20%-plus. This change is being driven partially by higher new store openings and occupancy cost, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. \n We also continue to see strong performance from our remodel stores, which drive comp sales lifts between 8% and 11% for our DGTP format and average returns, which continue to be greater than what we see from our new stores.  \n With this consistently strong performance, we continue to see real estate projects as one of our best uses of capital. In fiscal 2024, we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations.  \n While this is a significant number of projects, I want to acknowledge a smaller number than we have opened in the recent years due primarily to a couple of considerations. First, we want to ensure that our teams across the company are focused on getting back to the basics and the efforts I discussed a few moments ago.  \n And second, the capital required to execute these projects has increased significantly. For example, the initial opening of our 8,500 square foot store has increased more than 30% since we began rolling out the larger format in 2022. Additionally, nonresidential construction costs have increased significantly since pre-COVID.  \n Our team has a number of efforts underway to reduce these costs, including engineering costs out of the projects. And we believe, over time, we will be able to mitigate some of the impact we have seen from inflation.  \n With that said, our pipeline remains robust. We continue to see more than 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General bannered stores in the United States. And as we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high.  \n We continue to innovate on store formats as an important element of our real estate strategy, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our plans for 2024. We are placing a heavier emphasis on rural stores in 2024 with more than 80% of our new stores planned in rural communities where we believe we can have the most significant and positive impact for our customers.  \n In addition, more than 90% of our new stores and relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continues to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box. These larger stores also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings to help them build meals to feed their families, more health and beauty products and fresh produce in many stores. \n Also included within our store plans are approximately 30 new pop shelf locations as we continue to move at a measured pace with this concept in a softer discretionary sales environment.  Finally, we've been very pleased with our initial entry into Mexico and our new store plans for 2024 also include approximately 15 new Mi S\u00faper Dollar General stores in Mexico. \n Turning to remodels. Nearly 70% are planned to be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for significant increase in cooler count as well as the potential to add fresh produce in many of these stores. We are excited about our real estate plans for 2024 as we continue to grow the number of communities we are serving, particularly in rural America. \n In closing, we have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us, which we are uniquely well positioned to capture. We are working diligently on getting back to the basics, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers while providing meaningful opportunity for our employees and creating long-term value for our shareholders.  \n With that, I now would like to turn the call over to Kelly. \nKelly Dilts: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n For third quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29%, a decrease of 147 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in shrink, lower inventory markups and increased markdowns. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. \n Turning to SG&A, which was 24.5% of sales, an increase of 183 basis points. This increase was driven by retail labor, including approximately $29 million of our targeted labor investment as well as depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, rent, professional fees, other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 41.1% to $433.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 4.5%, a decrease of 330 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $82 million compared to $54 million in last year's third quarter, driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% and compares to 22.8% in the third quarter of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to increased benefits from federal employment tax credits and an increased benefit from rate-impacting items caused by lower earnings before taxes for the third quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 45.9% to $1.26. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to last year and a decrease of 1.8% on a per store basis. In addition, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 15% compared to last year and decreased 19% on a per store basis. \n While the inventory growth rate has significantly moderated from its peak in the third quarter last year and the quality of our inventory remains good, we continue to believe there is opportunity to optimize and reduce our inventory levels. We continue to review our markdown plans related to the previously announced $95 million investment, including associated costs to ensure we are maximizing the impact of these actions. \n We are focused on optimizing our overall inventory position to better support our customers, stores, distribution centers and growth plans. Year-to-date, through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.5%. \n Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.2 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $129.5 million. As planned, we did not repurchase shares this quarter. \n Now I want to take a moment to provide an update on our financial outlook. We continue to expect the following for fiscal year 2023. First, net sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Next, same-store sales in the range of a decline of approximately negative 1% to flat, and EPS in the range of $7.10 to $7.60 or a decline of negative 34% to negative 29%. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Finally, we expect capital spending in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, and no share repurchase activity. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for the rest of 2023. While we continue to see a more constrained consumer and softer sales trends than we expected coming into the year, those trends were anticipated when we provided our guidance update in October. \n We have always been an all-weather brand and aided by the actions that Todd outlined earlier, we are poised and ready to serve our customer in this challenging economic environment. In the near term, we expect continued overall pressure on the sales line, particularly in the nonconsumable categories. \n Within gross margin, in addition to sales mix pressure in our previously announced markdowns, shrink has continued to be a sizable headwind, and we expect this will remain with us into next year as any shrink improvement typically takes at least a year from a store's most recent count to show up in our financial results. \n Partially offsetting these challenges, we expect benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates, our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also continue to expect realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and the DG Media Network. \n Turning to SG&A. We plan to make the remaining $50 million of our planned total labor investment of approximately $150 million in our stores during Q4. Overall, the investments we have previously discussed in retail labor markdowns and other areas to better support our customers, stores and distribution centers are expected to total up to $270 million in 2023, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We are reviewing every aspect of these investments to ensure we maximize their impact for our customers and stores while driving the greatest return moving forward. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. \n Next, we return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment. And finally, over time, and when appropriate, share repurchases. Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in order to support our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. With all of that said, cash generation is very important, particularly in this environment, and we are focused on maintaining and improving strong cash flow as we head into 2024. \n In summary, we remain committed to maintaining our discipline and how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me just say again that we're laser-focused on getting back to the basics. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, some of these actions will take a little bit more time to deliver the desired results. But we expect to demonstrate significant progress over the coming months and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. .\n This team is energized, and we are confident in the actions we're taking to drive operational excellence for our customers and employees and long-term value creation for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their commitment to doing the work necessary to serve our customers and communities every day. I am proud of this team, and look forward to serving our customers together as we move through this busy holiday season. \n With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Welcome back, Todd. So I wanted to kick it off just with longer-term operating margins. Do you feel like you can sustain a 6%-plus operating margin level longer term? And do you think you can get back to 8%-plus, where you have historically operated? And then to get to that 8%-plus, where do you see potentially the bigger buckets of opportunity going forward? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the second part of that and then pass it over to Kelly. We hear a Dollar General have gone back to the basics. You heard that in my prepared remarks, and I have to say, it has truly energized this company at all different levels. \n Everything starts and stops at the store with the customer. And what we've done is actually, again, nothing rocket science here, we've actually gone in and looked at every element of our business. It touches our consumer from the lens of the consumer. \n Again, you would think that, that is always an ongoing piece. But sometimes it's good to remind yourself and remind you organization. So we've done that. And with that, and I won't go through all of that because you saw a lot of it in my prepared remarks, but really getting back to the basics, making sure that the labor that we've already have deployed in our stores and yet to come in the fourth quarter, the $150 million of additional labor is spend in the proper way. \n And again, that redeployment of money from the smart teams directly into our store where it touches our customer each and every day immediately is so important, and that's exactly what we're going to do. And as we do that, and I think it's very important to point out, it also helps the front end of that store. \n And it helps on the sales line because we've got somebody to meet, greet and ring up the customer. It also helps on the shrink line because you've got somebody at the front end of the store that is always there to monitor the front end of the store. \n And also, it helps on the convenience side because we had relied and start to reply too much this year on self-checkout in our stores. We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary. And so with all that, it's really going to help. And then when you focus in on our supply chain, getting the right product at the right time to our stores or OTIF in full and on time, I would tell you that, that's going to make a world of difference. \n Again, being an old operator that I am, there's nothing more disruptive in the store, not getting your truck on time and be able to get all the truck up onto the shelf when it comes in; and by the way, having the right items when you do put it on the shelf. \n And then lastly, really honing in this merchandising piece. We've got probably one of the best merchant groups in all of consumable retailing. But at times, you have to step back and look at what brought you to the party may not always be exactly what you need to do to go forward. Sometimes you got to step back to go forward. And I would tell you that's the case here on a couple of levels. One being the number of SKUs we're carrying, SKU rationalization is always an ongoing piece at Dollar General. \n But I believe that it's time to really step back and energize that even more in 2024. And we've already actually have gone deep here, turned off a lot of SKUs. There's going to be a lot more to come. And the idea here is turning off or eliminating SKUs that are more in the secondary or tertiary type of line. \n So think about [indiscernible] as an example. We may have 5 or 6 different variants of [indiscernible] on the shelf today. We can easily drop 1 or 2 of those. The consumer is not going to know the difference, actually is going to make her life a little simpler when she goes to the shelf, going to make the store's life simpler to put product on the shelf. \n And also, what it's going to do is help our warehouses actually eliminate a lot of holding slots. So a lot of benefit to what we're going to do in SKU rationalization. And all of this, which is fabulous, and I'll pass it over to Kelly, will actually start to move down to the bottom line, some faster than others. But again, being an old line retailer that I am, I know that these actions will fall to the bottom line and also help increase our top line as we go into '24. Kelly? \nKelly Dilts: Thanks, Todd. And just so everybody knows, our goal is certainly to get back to the historic levels of operating margin and profit that we're used to. While we're not going to give guidance, obviously, for '24 today, I do want to give a little bit of color of '24 just around some near-term headwinds that we're seeing. \n The first of those is around lapping really significantly reduced incentive compensation as well as stock-based compensation. And so that will just be a near-term headwind as we think about 2024. \n The other thing that we're looking at right now is we're expecting a higher effective tax rate. And that's really due to lower benefits around the stock-based compensation piece as well as we've seen historically just some higher state effective tax rates as we have moved through the last few years. \n So those are near-term headwinds, certainly not anything long term that we need to worry about. \n The other thing is around shrink. And so as you know, shrink has been pretty significant for us for a while, and it's definitely going to carry into 2024. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, it just takes a while to start showing up in your financial results. \n And just to give you a little bit more color of kind of where we are with shrink on a year-to-date basis. Shrink is actually 100 basis point headwind for us. And then as we moved into Q3, it's actually running just a little bit higher than that. And so certainly a pressure near term for us, something that we're looking to hopefully -- we're mitigating along the way, and it'll show up in the financial results later in 2024. \n And then as we think about just our underserved customers, we're just making sure that we're watching her and whether she gains -- stays gainfully employed. All the actions that Todd just noted and getting back to the basics is certainly going to set us up nicely to be able to serve her and it doesn't matter what economic environment. And we've always been an all-weather brand, and we certainly will continue to be so as we move forward. \n So that's a little bit of color on '24. We're going to give you a lot more color in March and give you a little bit more holistic view there. But what I'll say is, overall, the fundamentals of this business are absolutely unchanged and this model remains strong. And on a longer-term basis, we believe that we're going to get back to the historic levels that this model is accustomed to delivering. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Welcome back, Todd. When you rejoined, you talked about you having an opportunity to revisit the financial profile of the business. And if there was a time to look back and reset and invest deeper that you could take that opportunity. As the business looks to be forming a bottom in margin and thinking about getting to 7% or plus in a reasonable time frame, do you have any updated thoughts on that? Does it make sense to lean in so that when you start building back, it builds back sustainably, do you think the business needs a little more investment than you thought 1.5 months ago? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you for the question. And you're 100% right. The first few weeks back on the deck here, I did take a holistic view across not only our operations, but as you heard, our supply chain, our merchandising areas, looked at everything holistically, and I'll just click off a few. \n But first, let me say before I click it off, is that I believe that the investments that have been already talked about this year are $100 million and $150 million in totality labor investments were the exact right thing to do. I don't believe at this point that I see a need that we need to make any other larger outsized investments as we move into '24. \n I believe, as I indicated, that the right thing to do is make sure that the $150 million is being used appropriately and in the right areas that touches the consumer and helps our stores be able to better serve our consumer each and every day. And that's exactly what we've done now over the last few weeks. \n And that's why I believe taking the smart teams out of the equation, taking that whole bunch of labor that was dedicated to that, putting it directly in our stores to cover the front end of our stores more effectively each and every day, 100% of the time tethered to the front end for customer service and ringing up our customers. \n And then also one of the first for Dollar General, quite frankly, and that is deploying some of that labor into a work that ensures that we keep our perpetual inventory correct and ongoingly correct each and every day. Because once again, if the system doesn't realize you need product, it won't send you product. \n And unfortunately, over the last year or so, our perpetual inventory numbers have gotten further and further out of whack, quite frankly. And we are now in the midst of bringing those back. We've seen a lot of great traction, but the redeployment of hours of this $50 million coming out of the smart teams will really benefit. And again, this is a first for Dollar General, so it will be great to see that as well. And then as I looked into other areas of the company, I feel fabulous about our pricing. \n The great thing when I step back in, our everyday pricing across all channels of trade, including our chief competitor, looks very good and in great position. As a matter of fact, our gaps are right where we would like to see them compared to historical levels. So very good there. Our promotional activity, while I still believe I would call it semi rational across the spectrum, we have seen an uptick in recent weeks on promotional activity. \n We're watching that carefully. Is that because we're moving into the holidays? Or is that something that will sustain as we move into '24? So we're watching that carefully. But you know us pretty well, Simeon, we're going to take whatever action is needed. We're going to take it quickly, and we'll make sure that our pricing stays exactly where it needs to be to service our customers. \n But at this point, I don't see a need to reinvest any large amounts, sums of money in margin to do anything there. But again, we always reserve the right to be able to do it if that time arises. So right now, I think the investments we've already talked about over this past year are in the system. \n I believe they're appropriate. They're now being used, I believe, very appropriately in all areas and are deployed the proper way. Now it's time for execution. And that's what we're doing. We're already starting to see a little bit of benefit, especially as we moved into November on some of our top line results both in consumables and nonconsumables, quite frankly, as we move through November. \n So it's great to see it. But again, caution it's very early in the quarter, and it's very early in this new look at how Dollar General is going to go to market. But rest assured, as Kelly indicated, we feel very good about the long-term prospects of getting back to historical levels here at Dollar General. \nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Maybe, Todd, at higher level. Could you just help elaborate on some of the recent changes in behavior that you're seeing from the low-end consumer? The traffic versus ticket trends that you cited, I think, are interesting. But maybe asked a different way, traffic is improving, what's constraining the comp through the third quarter? Did comps actually turn positive in November tied to some of these initiatives? \n And then just lastly, on the new stores and the mindset shift to maybe down shift a bit, could you just elaborate on some of those pieces that you walked through, occupancy costs and some of the other moving parts? And just what you're seeing on the new store return to maybe just take a pause here? \nTodd Vasos: Okay, sure. As we look at our results as we move through the quarter, as we indicated, each of the periods were very similar, but we did see continued uptick in our traffic as we move through the quarter and then into November. \n Now I'm not going to give you a lot of color in November, but to say that we did see a change in trajectory on our comp as well as we moved into November. So it was great to see. And I would tell you that, again, it was both on the consumable and the nonconsumable side of the equation. \n Now one would say, \"Well, where is it in the comp?\" Well, I would tell you the comp actually was much better as we move through the end of October into November, but we still have a lot of work to do, Matt, to get back to some historical comp type rights here at Dollar General. \n I believe the back to basic work that we're doing is going to help us get there faster as you move into the back half of Q4 and into Q1 of '24. Making sure our stores are stocked each and every day when the consumer walks in the store. They'll be able to find what they need is going to be very, very important. So more to come. We've already started to see that. \n We've actually have seen our in-stock rates markedly improve over the last few weeks. We check it and watch it each and every week. And I believe that has added to some of that betterment and comp that I talked about in November. So more to come. \n I believe the macro still has an effect on us as well as others. But what we've always been and prided ourselves on control, which you can control here at Dollar General, and we're doing just that with back to basics. And we believe that we can help overcome some of those shortcomings in the macro environment with being able to control what -- and what the consumer feels and sees when she's in the store. So more to come. We feel like we're on the right track here, but we've got a lot of work yet to do, but I feel good about that. \n As far as our new stores. As you noted, we did take a little bit of a step back this year. Again, this was one of the areas that I cracked open as soon as I walked in the door. Again, we looked at -- there was no sacred cows. We looked at every single piece of this business. \n One of the things that I do here with the team, every line of that P&L is scrutinized, every single line, including our investments in capital. And as I looked at our new stores, while still wildly the best use of our capital across the board, I feel it was a prudent decision to take a step back. \n Now some people would say, \"Boy, still building 800 stores, that's not too big of a step back, that's still a large commitment,\" and it is, Matt. But it was a prudent decision for a couple of reasons. \n One, we talked about the increased cost to build a store today. The interest rates are up. The cost to build a store is up. I feel very good about the work the team has done. They've mitigated some of those costs, but we still have a lot of work to do yet to mitigate even further some of these costs. So why not take a little bit of a step back in new store development, give our teams the opportunity to also get a lower cost to put these buildings in. \n So we're doing that as we speak. And I believe that it's exactly the right thing to do. And then as you then step a little bit further back, when you look at some of the work we have to do just internally, it's probably a prudent thing to do to step back a little bit as well, so we can go forward faster in the outer years. \n Now I believe that this -- while this may or may not be a 1-year phenomenon, I would tell you that the way we're looking at it right now, we're not here to give guidance past '24, is that we don't see any reason why we can't up our new store openings as we continue to move forward. \n We love what we see on still 12,000 opportunities to put a Dollar General out in the continental United States, and we've always prided ourselves on being very quick and first to market to capture the majority and release the oversized portion of those 12,000 opportunities. So nothing yet that we see stands in the way of that. And Kelly, you may want to just touch on the returns just really quickly. \nKelly Dilts: Yes. No, absolutely. And so an 18% return in this environment is fabulous, and Todd noted it, it's still a great use of capital. The new unit economics are still very strong as we move into '24. And it has a great payback period still of less than 2 years. \n And the other thing that we haven't seen is any change in the cannibalization rate. The other thing I'd point out and Dollar General is just fantastic at this. Our real estate group is pretty amazing, and we have an extremely high hit rate of success and you've seen that over the years. So we feel really good about the projects. We feel good about the 18% return, and of course, as Todd noted, while we're pleased with all of that in typical Dollar General fashion, we're going to work to improve it as we go through '24. \nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to talk about inventory a little bit. Just in terms of the progress rightsizing your inventory position. Can you just give us a little bit more perspective on where you sit today with consumables versus nonconsumables? \n And then is it your expectation to exit the year clean? Or do you feel like you're going to still need some incremental actions into next year? And then I'll just add a second part to the question around the top line. When you look at the improving trends the last few months, to what extent has that been influenced by markdowns and clearance activity? \nKelly Dilts: Yes. No, thanks for the question. And inventory reduction is absolutely a priority of ours this year, and it will be a priority as we move into next year. I think the good news for us is that the quality of our inventory is good, but we've talked a lot in the past about the benefits of inventory reduction and just what that does as you reduce the complexities in both the stores and the distribution centers. \n So I would say our progress is on track in our reduction efforts, and you saw a little bit of that in the numbers today. So total inventory increase was 3% on a year-over-year basis. But if you look at it on a per store basis, we're down 1.8%. I think the real story here is, is around the nonconsumable piece. And so we are down 15% on a year-over-year basis there, and we're down 19% on a per store basis. \n I think the other important thing to call out, and we've been calling it out every quarter, but this one is even more significant as we've seen a 58% decrease in our import receipts. And again, that's us buying around that product and making sure that we're selling through it. And so we feel good about where we're headed for the end of the year. \n Just a little bit longer term, I'd say we have several work streams in place that are working on inventory reduction, but just as important, and this kind of goes to the top line is inventory optimization and making sure that we're going where the customer wants us to go. \n And so I would say with all of these things in place, we should feel pretty good about where we're landing at the end of '23, but we're going to feel even better as we see continued improvement in inventory levels as we move through '24. \nTodd Vasos: Thanks, Kelly. And as you look at our results in Q3 and how that relates to any activity around clearing this inventory, I would tell you that I feel very good about the balance here. While there was some activity there, actually, some of the bigger activities is really slated for Q4, if needed. \n And a lot of that will be centered around our sell-through of holiday. \n So we're watching that very closely. But again, early results would say it's right in line where we thought it would be right now. And actually, in some areas, a little bit better. So we're watching that carefully. But I would also say, as we continue to move forward, what we like and what I've seen since I've been back, is I believe we've done exactly the right thing on moving through some of this inventory. \n But as I look at the quality of our inventory, it is in very good shape. And actually, as Kelly just indicated, a lot of what we have right now to deal with on an overstock basis is actually more in our core everyday goods. So this isn't about a bunch of screw drivers and hammers or fashion-type items for holiday that we have to move through, this is about having a little bit too much of some basic paper cleaning, food-type items, things like that, that will move through the system pretty naturally as long as we do the right thing with our supply chain and our stores, and that's exactly what back to the basics is meant to address. So feel very good about that and very good about what we see going into the back half of this year and '24. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Welcome back, Todd. Given everything that outlined this morning, when is it realistic for us as outsiders to hold the team accountable to getting back to consistently producing a double-digit EPS growth algorithm like Dollar General has done in the past? And as part of that, Kelly pointed to a few factors that are going to weigh on Dollar General's profitability in 2024. Could you give more texture and timing around how large those factors are like incentive compensation and shrink? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, thank you, Michael. As both Kelly and I have both said, I don't see anything that gets in the way longer term to getting back to some of our historical ways that we return to our shareholders and our customers. We feel that we're on the right track with our back to basics moves here, both in our labor investments, in our inventory investments as well as in our supply chain and merchandising. \n So we feel like we've taken the right appropriate actions now, and we're moving with speed and intent. As I said in my prepared remarks, some of it will occur and manifest itself faster and some will take a little bit more time. But rest assured, we are hitting every single item, and we're monitoring every single item every week here to make sure it's on the right track. And if it happens not to move the way we want, we will then make an adjustment to ensure that it does. \n We are squarely focused on getting this company back to its historical returns that everyone is accustomed to seeing. And most importantly, our customer is used to seeing at store level. Now as Kelly indicated, there are some near-term headwinds. As much as I would love Michael to give you more color right now, we're not here to give '24 guidance. \n We wanted to though make sure that you can contextualize at least some of those headwinds as we start to move into 2024, but rest assured, we're going to give you more than you need in the components when we come back and give you the guidance for 2024 to make sure that you can build the models out the proper way. \n But again, I want to make sure you also understand, though, that we're not going to wait till '24. We're taking action now to continue to modify and also continue to ensure that we're addressing any of the gaps that are out there that are well in our control. There'll just be a few things that may not be fully in our control in '24 that will probably be more of a onetime in nature that we'll address at the right time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We were wondering how you would frame the risk of deflation across your box into next year? And how do you think about the puts and takes across the P&L as a result? \nTodd Vasos: Yes. That's a good question. And there's been a lot written up in certain areas on deflation. We've seen some deflationary pieces starting to show up, especially in our nonconsumable discretionary type areas. Nothing that alarms us at this point as we move into 2024. How we're looking at it is we see some real opportunity to reduce initial costs, especially in our import-related goods, not only from the factory, but also for the transportation side. \n So ocean freight, fuel cost, bunker fuel cost and such have moderated greatly over the last year. So there's some opportunity to pull cost out. Some of that, we will definitely pass on to the consumer as we continue to watch, especially in those commodity areas of the import side of the business because there's always some good -- even in our nonconsumable areas, there are some good commodity-type items in there. \n From a consumable perspective, while there's always movement in those areas of commodities: milk, dairy type areas, oils, wheat, we watch that very carefully. We have component pricing here at Dollar General for not only our national brands, but our private brands. We watch that very, very closely and we monitor that. \n Now in saying that, we haven't seen in center of store, if you will, dry grocery, chemical paper, very, very little deflationary pressures. A little bit on those commodities in dairy, as I indicated, some meat items, which we don't -- are not a huge player in. Produce, we're a little bit of a player there in what we've done.\n There's some deflation there. But again, I would tell you, in totality, nothing that alarms us or believes that it will adversely affect the top line as we move into '24, at least nothing at this point shows that. \nOperator: Our final question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Welcome back, Todd as well. Can you talk a little bit about the out-of-stock issue and perhaps quantify the drag that it's been to comps over the past few quarters? I believe it's probably pretty sizable and the measures you're taking to improve that issue? \n And then on the SKU rationalization, that's interesting. I was just wondering if you could speak to maybe the number of SKUs you have in an average store today? So say, relative to back in 2019 and how big of an opportunity that can be? And how long do you think you'll take to get back to an optimal level? \nTodd Vasos: Yes, sure. I would tell you that the amount of out of stocks we have in our store are probably some of the largest that I've seen in the 15-plus years I've been here and saying that. There are so many work streams that are now underway, Chuck, that I feel good about where we're headed. \n As I just indicated a few moments ago, we saw a meaningful change over the last 2 weeks in our in-stock rates at store level. And these are not just on our perpetual inventory system, but this has actually counted inventory from our inventory -- our Washington inventory group that takes our yearly fiscal inventory. \n So these are real counts, if you will, real out of stocks and not just out of stocks on the shelf, but out of stocks in the back room, too, so meaning it is not in the system for the consumer at all. So we saw a meaningful drop in that, meaning more available to the consumer. \n We believe as we move through the rest of this quarter and into the first, we're going to make even further meaningful advances. Why? We're putting hours toward the inventory specialist role that I mentioned earlier. This is a first for Dollar General to go in and ensure that we keep our on hand or our perpetual inventories more accurate than we have in the past. \n We've done this activity in the past, but we have come up with and we are teaching and training individuals to do this in a little bit of a different way, taking a fresh look at it, a fresh approach at it, doing more areas of the store on a weekly basis at a time to ensure that we touch every SKU. \n And by the way, touching every department of the store at least once a month and the higher velocity areas more than once a month. So we feel good about the direction. We feel good about how we will be able to quickly pivot and make some adjustments here.\n Now on the SKU rationalization side. I would tell you that -- and we've said this in the past, we've got between 11,000 and 12,000 total SKUs in our store today, depending on the format, right? We've got some larger formats, as you know, than our smaller ones. \n But we believe we have an opportunity to take out a meaningful number of SKUs. I'm not going to give you the number right now. We're still in the midst of looking at that. And how we're looking at it again is from that secondary and tertiary type areas that I talked about it earlier. \n We're also, though, taking a fresh approach to look to it from a standpoint of return, right? And so not only a GMROI look at it, but also looking at it from the standpoint of shrink and other areas of components that go into a SKU. And is it still profitable? With shrink being elevated, so a lot of it in our control, some not in our control. There may be SKUs -- and by the way, there are SKUs that we'll be dropping due to the amount of shrink that is in our store as well. \n So it's going to be a fresh look across the portfolio SKUs we carry with the consumer in mind first, but also profitability in mind throughout the entire supply chain through our stores. So more to come. I think we can give you a little bit more color as we go into Q1 of next year on both our progress as well as maybe contextualize how meaningful we're talking about here. But rest assured, I wouldn't talk about it on this if I didn't believe it was going to be a meaningful number of SKUs and a meaningful impact to the simplification efforts within our stores. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Todd Vasos for closing comments. \nTodd Vasos: Thank you, and thanks for all the questions and your kind words for welcoming me back. As I said last year that serving this team at Dollar General has been the highlight of my professional career, and I feel the same sense of honor today. \n As you heard this morning, we have some hard work yet ahead of us but we know what to do. We've done it before, and we are absolutely set on doing it again as quickly as possible. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and all that we've accomplished together over the years and will continue to do so for our customers, associates and shareholders. Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be back at Dollar General. I have a deep passion for this company and for the customers we are privileged to serve. I continue to believe in this model, our future growth prospects and our ability to deliver value and convenience for our customers, a positive experience for our employees, and long-term value for our shareholders.  \n We take our mission of serving others seriously and know that our customer is facing financial constraints and communities are looking for strong partners in a tough macroeconomic environment. Historically, we've met those challenges head-on and delivered for our customer. And we believe that we are well positioned to do so now.  \n In retail, one of the best ways to diagnose the state of the business is by looking at it through the eyes of the customer. And we know that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. \n We have spent the last several weeks taking a fresh look at all areas of our business as well as the challenges and opportunities in front of us. We believe that we have a good understanding of what we need to do to address those challenges and opportunities, and we're already taking action. To be clear, this is not about rebuilding a team or organization, but about refocusing efforts already underway. This is where I want to spend the majority of our time today.  \n I won't share all the details this morning but I want to provide an overview to highlight our focus on getting back to the basics in our stores, in our supply chain and within our merchandising. After that, Kelly and I will review our third quarter performance.  \n I want to start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. As we drive improvement across our store footprint, we are doing so through the lens of our customers. As we have previously announced, we are investing approximately $150 million in store labor hours this year. After review, we continue to believe this level of investment is appropriate. But as we do with every dollar we invest, we must ensure we are spending it to drive the greatest return, which means we are directly helping our store teams support our customers.  \n With that in mind, we have made the decision to redeploy labor hours away from smart teams and instead more directly to our store teams and a greater emphasis on customer service and store-level inventory management activities.  \n To that end, I want to highlight 2 areas of focus we believe will drive the greatest improvement in our stores. First, we plan to increase the employee presence at the front end of our stores and in particular, the checkout area. While self-checkout has contributed to the convenient proposition for our customers in certain stores, it does not reduce the importance of a friendly, helpful employee who is there to greet customers and assist while the checkout process is happening.  \n We have already begun by allocating more labor to front-end activities and clearly communicating our expectations around the visible presence of an associate at the front of our stores.  \n Second, we are reemphasizing the role played by our store teams in our perpetual inventory management process, which we believe will positively impact our on-shelf availability as well as our customers' convenience perception in our sales.  \n To do this, we are reallocating some of our labor investments toward store level inventory management processes, including an even greater focus on getting product on to our shelves more quickly. We are also reducing the span of control for our district managers which will provide more opportunity for engagement with our store managers and their teams and more consistency and execution across the store base.  \n As we take these actions and focus on the basics in our stores, we believe we will see improved retention at the store manager level where our turnover is currently higher than we like. And we know from experience that when we stabilize the store manager position, the entire store and team benefit, which ultimately drives a more positive experience for our customers as well as improved sales and shrink results.  \n Overall, we believe these actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service, on-shelf availability and convenience as well as sales, while our focus on the front end should also reduce shrink. These efforts also should help us improve employee engagement and retention.  \n Next, I want to talk about our supply chain. We have made significant progress recovering from the distribution capacity constraints that we had discussed late last year. However, through the lens of the customer, we see additional opportunity for improvement, particularly when it comes to serving our stores.  \n As we focus on getting back to the basics, the goal within our supply chain is for our truck deliveries to be on time and in full, or OTIF. As we continue to drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work for our store teams, which again results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates as well as an expectation of higher sales. \n I want to briefly highlight 3 areas of focus within our supply chain. First, we plan to better optimize the inventory within our distribution centers. As I will discuss in a moment, we are taking steps to reduce inventory, including SKU rationalization, which will allow for the more efficient movement of product for our distribution teams. Second, we are implementing productivity improvement initiatives within our distribution centers. While productivity rates have been impacted by both internal and external factors, we are working to mitigate or eliminate productivity impediments for our teams and control the things we can control.  \n These efforts include standardizing system configurations and optimizing the product layout in our facilities, while providing clear communication on performance standards and expectations.  \n And third, now that we're past the capacity constraints we experienced last year, we are reducing the number of temporary outside warehouse facilities being used to store product as inventory flows more effectively to and through our existing distribution centers.  \n By better leveraging these existing distribution centers and taking advantage of the new permanent facilities we have opened over the last year and those we will open next year, we believe we can significantly reduce the amount of temporary warehouse space needed.  \n As we've done historically, we likely will continue to maintain a few of these temporary facilities. However, we expect to transition out of many of them in Q4 and into next year. All of these actions within our supply chain should translate to lower distribution and transportation costs, better OTIF rates and better customer experience and all while improving sales results.\n Finally, I want to speak to our focus on fundamentals and merchandising. Once again, we reflected on our approach to the eyes of our customer. For our merchants, there is no greater priority than offering great value of the products our customers want and need.  \n Our customers are offering living paycheck to paycheck and continually tell us that value is the most important factor in their shopping decisions. I am pleased to note that we are in good shape when it comes to our everyday pricing. And we are right where we want to be in our price gaps with our competitors and classes of trade.  \n With that said, we are taking a hard look at what else we can do to drive value for our customers in this challenging economic environment, including highlighting private brands and other opportunities for savings as well as maximizing the effectiveness of any promotional activity to drive traffic and share growth.  \n Beyond these opportunities for our customers, we have also challenged our merchants to consider how they can drive simplification for our stores and supply chain as well with meaningful SKU rationalization as one of the most immediate areas of focus.  \n To that end, we have identified several opportunities to eliminate certain SKUs that have become less productive; first, by moving them out of our DCs and then ultimately to our stores to sell through. As our store teams have fewer SKUs to manage, we can lower our cost to serve, while driving higher inventory turns and higher sales of products that are most important to our customers.  We believe these actions will help further reduce inventory and shrink, while simplifying operations in both DCs and stores to drive greater efficiencies over the longer term.  \n We all know that driving traffic and market share are essential to long-term retail success. And while our results have been improving in these areas, we are still not satisfied with our current position. We believe we have identified actions that will pay dividends over both the short and long term, as we remain focused on driving profitable sales growth.  \n In summary, we are getting back to the basics here at Dollar General across all levels of the organization. Our desired results will not materialize overnight, but we believe we will see some early wins and continue to make progress towards executing on the fundamentals that have been foundational to our success over the past 85 years. As a result, we believe we will significantly enhance the customer experience while driving higher sales and increased profitability in our business.  \n Now before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to briefly discuss some of our top line results for Q3 as well as our 2024 real estate plans, which we announced earlier this morning.  \n Net sales in the third quarter increased 2.4% to $9.7 billion compared to net sales of $9.5 billion last year's third quarter. Within our net sales growth, we again grew market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales as well as an overall non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales decreased 1.3% in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. The decrease was driven by a decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by units and included declines in all 4 product categories.  \n From an overall monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was very similar in all 3 months of the quarter. However, I'm pleased to note that customer traffic was positive in Q3. After starting the quarter slightly negative, traffic turned positive in the middle period and improved sequentially each period of the quarter.  \n Notably, Customer traffic and same-store sales continue to improve in November, which, although early in the quarter, we believe reflects early traction from our work on getting back to the basics here at Dollar General.  \n Turning to a quick update on our customer. During our most recent survey work, our customer continues to tell us they are feeling significant pressure on their spending which is supported by what we see in their behavior. Based on these trends and what we see in the macroeconomic environment, we anticipate customer spending may continue to be constrained as we head into 2024, especially in discretionary categories.  \n This further reinforces the importance of the work we're doing today, and we believe our unique value and convenient proposition is as relevant as ever in this marketplace. To that end, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth next year as we look to extend our offering to many more communities.  \n Real estate continues to be one of our core competencies and we remain pleased with the performance of our real estate projects. As a reminder, we monitor the following 5 metrics of our new store portfolio, including performance against pro forma sales expectations, new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in 2 years or less; and new store returns, which we expect to be approximately 18% on average in 2024.  \n I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, are down modestly from our historical target of 20%-plus. This change is being driven partially by higher new store openings and occupancy cost, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. \n We also continue to see strong performance from our remodel stores, which drive comp sales lifts between 8% and 11% for our DGTP format and average returns, which continue to be greater than what we see from our new stores.  \n With this consistently strong performance, we continue to see real estate projects as one of our best uses of capital. In fiscal 2024, we plan to execute approximately 2,385 projects, including 800 new openings, 1,500 remodels and 85 relocations.  \n While this is a significant number of projects, I want to acknowledge a smaller number than we have opened in the recent years due primarily to a couple of considerations. First, we want to ensure that our teams across the company are focused on getting back to the basics and the efforts I discussed a few moments ago.  \n And second, the capital required to execute these projects has increased significantly. For example, the initial opening of our 8,500 square foot store has increased more than 30% since we began rolling out the larger format in 2022. Additionally, nonresidential construction costs have increased significantly since pre-COVID.  \n Our team has a number of efforts underway to reduce these costs, including engineering costs out of the projects. And we believe, over time, we will be able to mitigate some of the impact we have seen from inflation.  \n With that said, our pipeline remains robust. We continue to see more than 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General bannered stores in the United States. And as we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high.  \n We continue to innovate on store formats as an important element of our real estate strategy, and I want to take a moment to provide some additional color on our plans for 2024. We are placing a heavier emphasis on rural stores in 2024 with more than 80% of our new stores planned in rural communities where we believe we can have the most significant and positive impact for our customers.  \n In addition, more than 90% of our new stores and relocations will be in one of our larger store formats, which continues to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box. These larger stores also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings to help them build meals to feed their families, more health and beauty products and fresh produce in many stores. \n Also included within our store plans are approximately 30 new pop shelf locations as we continue to move at a measured pace with this concept in a softer discretionary sales environment.  Finally, we've been very pleased with our initial entry into Mexico and our new store plans for 2024 also include approximately 15 new Mi Su\u0301per Dollar General stores in Mexico. \n Turning to remodels. Nearly 70% are planned to be in our DGTP format, which will provide the opportunity for significant increase in cooler count as well as the potential to add fresh produce in many of these stores. We are excited about our real estate plans for 2024 as we continue to grow the number of communities we are serving, particularly in rural America. \n In closing, we have tremendous growth opportunities in front of us, which we are uniquely well positioned to capture. We are working diligently on getting back to the basics, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers while providing meaningful opportunity for our employees and creating long-term value for our shareholders.  \n With that, I now would like to turn the call over to Kelly. Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me just say again that we're laser-focused on getting back to the basics. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, some of these actions will take a little bit more time to deliver the desired results. But we expect to demonstrate significant progress over the coming months and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. .\n This team is energized, and we are confident in the actions we're taking to drive operational excellence for our customers and employees and long-term value creation for our shareholders. I want to thank our approximately 185,000 employees for their commitment to doing the work necessary to serve our customers and communities every day. I am proud of this team, and look forward to serving our customers together as we move through this busy holiday season. \n With that, operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the second part of that and then pass it over to Kelly. We hear a Dollar General have gone back to the basics. You heard that in my prepared remarks, and I have to say, it has truly energized this company at all different levels. \n Everything starts and stops at the store with the customer. And what we've done is actually, again, nothing rocket science here, we've actually gone in and looked at every element of our business. It touches our consumer from the lens of the consumer. \n Again, you would think that, that is always an ongoing piece. But sometimes it's good to remind yourself and remind you organization. So we've done that. And with that, and I won't go through all of that because you saw a lot of it in my prepared remarks, but really getting back to the basics, making sure that the labor that we've already have deployed in our stores and yet to come in the fourth quarter, the $150 million of additional labor is spend in the proper way. \n And again, that redeployment of money from the smart teams directly into our store where it touches our customer each and every day immediately is so important, and that's exactly what we're going to do. And as we do that, and I think it's very important to point out, it also helps the front end of that store. \n And it helps on the sales line because we've got somebody to meet, greet and ring up the customer. It also helps on the shrink line because you've got somebody at the front end of the store that is always there to monitor the front end of the store. \n And also, it helps on the convenience side because we had relied and start to reply too much this year on self-checkout in our stores. We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary. And so with all that, it's really going to help. And then when you focus in on our supply chain, getting the right product at the right time to our stores or OTIF in full and on time, I would tell you that, that's going to make a world of difference. \n Again, being an old operator that I am, there's nothing more disruptive in the store, not getting your truck on time and be able to get all the truck up onto the shelf when it comes in; and by the way, having the right items when you do put it on the shelf. \n And then lastly, really honing in this merchandising piece. We've got probably one of the best merchant groups in all of consumable retailing. But at times, you have to step back and look at what brought you to the party may not always be exactly what you need to do to go forward. Sometimes you got to step back to go forward. And I would tell you that's the case here on a couple of levels. One being the number of SKUs we're carrying, SKU rationalization is always an ongoing piece at Dollar General. \n But I believe that it's time to really step back and energize that even more in 2024. And we've already actually have gone deep here, turned off a lot of SKUs. There's going to be a lot more to come. And the idea here is turning off or eliminating SKUs that are more in the secondary or tertiary type of line. \n So think about [indiscernible] as an example. We may have 5 or 6 different variants of [indiscernible] on the shelf today. We can easily drop 1 or 2 of those. The consumer is not going to know the difference, actually is going to make her life a little simpler when she goes to the shelf, going to make the store's life simpler to put product on the shelf. \n And also, what it's going to do is help our warehouses actually eliminate a lot of holding slots. So a lot of benefit to what we're going to do in SKU rationalization. And all of this, which is fabulous, and I'll pass it over to Kelly, will actually start to move down to the bottom line, some faster than others. But again, being an old line retailer that I am, I know that these actions will fall to the bottom line and also help increase our top line as we go into '24. Kelly? Yes. Thank you for the question. And you're 100% right. The first few weeks back on the deck here, I did take a holistic view across not only our operations, but as you heard, our supply chain, our merchandising areas, looked at everything holistically, and I'll just click off a few. \n But first, let me say before I click it off, is that I believe that the investments that have been already talked about this year are $100 million and $150 million in totality labor investments were the exact right thing to do. I don't believe at this point that I see a need that we need to make any other larger outsized investments as we move into '24. \n I believe, as I indicated, that the right thing to do is make sure that the $150 million is being used appropriately and in the right areas that touches the consumer and helps our stores be able to better serve our consumer each and every day. And that's exactly what we've done now over the last few weeks. \n And that's why I believe taking the smart teams out of the equation, taking that whole bunch of labor that was dedicated to that, putting it directly in our stores to cover the front end of our stores more effectively each and every day, 100% of the time tethered to the front end for customer service and ringing up our customers. \n And then also one of the first for Dollar General, quite frankly, and that is deploying some of that labor into a work that ensures that we keep our perpetual inventory correct and ongoingly correct each and every day. Because once again, if the system doesn't realize you need product, it won't send you product. \n And unfortunately, over the last year or so, our perpetual inventory numbers have gotten further and further out of whack, quite frankly. And we are now in the midst of bringing those back. We've seen a lot of great traction, but the redeployment of hours of this $50 million coming out of the smart teams will really benefit. And again, this is a first for Dollar General, so it will be great to see that as well. And then as I looked into other areas of the company, I feel fabulous about our pricing. \n The great thing when I step back in, our everyday pricing across all channels of trade, including our chief competitor, looks very good and in great position. As a matter of fact, our gaps are right where we would like to see them compared to historical levels. So very good there. Our promotional activity, while I still believe I would call it semi rational across the spectrum, we have seen an uptick in recent weeks on promotional activity. \n We're watching that carefully. Is that because we're moving into the holidays? Or is that something that will sustain as we move into '24? So we're watching that carefully. But you know us pretty well, Simeon, we're going to take whatever action is needed. We're going to take it quickly, and we'll make sure that our pricing stays exactly where it needs to be to service our customers. \n But at this point, I don't see a need to reinvest any large amounts, sums of money in margin to do anything there. But again, we always reserve the right to be able to do it if that time arises. So right now, I think the investments we've already talked about over this past year are in the system. \n I believe they're appropriate. They're now being used, I believe, very appropriately in all areas and are deployed the proper way. Now it's time for execution. And that's what we're doing. We're already starting to see a little bit of benefit, especially as we moved into November on some of our top line results both in consumables and nonconsumables, quite frankly, as we move through November. \n So it's great to see it. But again, caution it's very early in the quarter, and it's very early in this new look at how Dollar General is going to go to market. But rest assured, as Kelly indicated, we feel very good about the long-term prospects of getting back to historical levels here at Dollar General. Okay, sure. As we look at our results as we move through the quarter, as we indicated, each of the periods were very similar, but we did see continued uptick in our traffic as we move through the quarter and then into November. \n Now I'm not going to give you a lot of color in November, but to say that we did see a change in trajectory on our comp as well as we moved into November. So it was great to see. And I would tell you that, again, it was both on the consumable and the nonconsumable side of the equation. \n Now one would say, \"Well, where is it in the comp?\" Well, I would tell you the comp actually was much better as we move through the end of October into November, but we still have a lot of work to do, Matt, to get back to some historical comp type rights here at Dollar General. \n I believe the back to basic work that we're doing is going to help us get there faster as you move into the back half of Q4 and into Q1 of '24. Making sure our stores are stocked each and every day when the consumer walks in the store. They'll be able to find what they need is going to be very, very important. So more to come. We've already started to see that. \n We've actually have seen our in-stock rates markedly improve over the last few weeks. We check it and watch it each and every week. And I believe that has added to some of that betterment and comp that I talked about in November. So more to come. \n I believe the macro still has an effect on us as well as others. But what we've always been and prided ourselves on control, which you can control here at Dollar General, and we're doing just that with back to basics. And we believe that we can help overcome some of those shortcomings in the macro environment with being able to control what -- and what the consumer feels and sees when she's in the store. So more to come. We feel like we're on the right track here, but we've got a lot of work yet to do, but I feel good about that. \n As far as our new stores. As you noted, we did take a little bit of a step back this year. Again, this was one of the areas that I cracked open as soon as I walked in the door. Again, we looked at -- there was no sacred cows. We looked at every single piece of this business. \n One of the things that I do here with the team, every line of that P&L is scrutinized, every single line, including our investments in capital. And as I looked at our new stores, while still wildly the best use of our capital across the board, I feel it was a prudent decision to take a step back. \n Now some people would say, \"Boy, still building 800 stores, that's not too big of a step back, that's still a large commitment,\" and it is, Matt. But it was a prudent decision for a couple of reasons. \n One, we talked about the increased cost to build a store today. The interest rates are up. The cost to build a store is up. I feel very good about the work the team has done. They've mitigated some of those costs, but we still have a lot of work to do yet to mitigate even further some of these costs. So why not take a little bit of a step back in new store development, give our teams the opportunity to also get a lower cost to put these buildings in. \n So we're doing that as we speak. And I believe that it's exactly the right thing to do. And then as you then step a little bit further back, when you look at some of the work we have to do just internally, it's probably a prudent thing to do to step back a little bit as well, so we can go forward faster in the outer years. \n Now I believe that this -- while this may or may not be a 1-year phenomenon, I would tell you that the way we're looking at it right now, we're not here to give guidance past '24, is that we don't see any reason why we can't up our new store openings as we continue to move forward. \n We love what we see on still 12,000 opportunities to put a Dollar General out in the continental United States, and we've always prided ourselves on being very quick and first to market to capture the majority and release the oversized portion of those 12,000 opportunities. So nothing yet that we see stands in the way of that. And Kelly, you may want to just touch on the returns just really quickly. Thanks, Kelly. And as you look at our results in Q3 and how that relates to any activity around clearing this inventory, I would tell you that I feel very good about the balance here. While there was some activity there, actually, some of the bigger activities is really slated for Q4, if needed. \n And a lot of that will be centered around our sell-through of holiday. \n So we're watching that very closely. But again, early results would say it's right in line where we thought it would be right now. And actually, in some areas, a little bit better. So we're watching that carefully. But I would also say, as we continue to move forward, what we like and what I've seen since I've been back, is I believe we've done exactly the right thing on moving through some of this inventory. \n But as I look at the quality of our inventory, it is in very good shape. And actually, as Kelly just indicated, a lot of what we have right now to deal with on an overstock basis is actually more in our core everyday goods. So this isn't about a bunch of screw drivers and hammers or fashion-type items for holiday that we have to move through, this is about having a little bit too much of some basic paper cleaning, food-type items, things like that, that will move through the system pretty naturally as long as we do the right thing with our supply chain and our stores, and that's exactly what back to the basics is meant to address. So feel very good about that and very good about what we see going into the back half of this year and '24. Yes, thank you, Michael. As both Kelly and I have both said, I don't see anything that gets in the way longer term to getting back to some of our historical ways that we return to our shareholders and our customers. We feel that we're on the right track with our back to basics moves here, both in our labor investments, in our inventory investments as well as in our supply chain and merchandising. \n So we feel like we've taken the right appropriate actions now, and we're moving with speed and intent. As I said in my prepared remarks, some of it will occur and manifest itself faster and some will take a little bit more time. But rest assured, we are hitting every single item, and we're monitoring every single item every week here to make sure it's on the right track. And if it happens not to move the way we want, we will then make an adjustment to ensure that it does. \n We are squarely focused on getting this company back to its historical returns that everyone is accustomed to seeing. And most importantly, our customer is used to seeing at store level. Now as Kelly indicated, there are some near-term headwinds. As much as I would love Michael to give you more color right now, we're not here to give '24 guidance. \n We wanted to though make sure that you can contextualize at least some of those headwinds as we start to move into 2024, but rest assured, we're going to give you more than you need in the components when we come back and give you the guidance for 2024 to make sure that you can build the models out the proper way. \n But again, I want to make sure you also understand, though, that we're not going to wait till '24. We're taking action now to continue to modify and also continue to ensure that we're addressing any of the gaps that are out there that are well in our control. There'll just be a few things that may not be fully in our control in '24 that will probably be more of a onetime in nature that we'll address at the right time. Yes. That's a good question. And there's been a lot written up in certain areas on deflation. We've seen some deflationary pieces starting to show up, especially in our nonconsumable discretionary type areas. Nothing that alarms us at this point as we move into 2024. How we're looking at it is we see some real opportunity to reduce initial costs, especially in our import-related goods, not only from the factory, but also for the transportation side. \n So ocean freight, fuel cost, bunker fuel cost and such have moderated greatly over the last year. So there's some opportunity to pull cost out. Some of that, we will definitely pass on to the consumer as we continue to watch, especially in those commodity areas of the import side of the business because there's always some good -- even in our nonconsumable areas, there are some good commodity-type items in there. \n From a consumable perspective, while there's always movement in those areas of commodities: milk, dairy type areas, oils, wheat, we watch that very carefully. We have component pricing here at Dollar General for not only our national brands, but our private brands. We watch that very, very closely and we monitor that. \n Now in saying that, we haven't seen in center of store, if you will, dry grocery, chemical paper, very, very little deflationary pressures. A little bit on those commodities in dairy, as I indicated, some meat items, which we don't -- are not a huge player in. Produce, we're a little bit of a player there in what we've done.\n There's some deflation there. But again, I would tell you, in totality, nothing that alarms us or believes that it will adversely affect the top line as we move into '24, at least nothing at this point shows that. Yes, sure. I would tell you that the amount of out of stocks we have in our store are probably some of the largest that I've seen in the 15-plus years I've been here and saying that. There are so many work streams that are now underway, Chuck, that I feel good about where we're headed. \n As I just indicated a few moments ago, we saw a meaningful change over the last 2 weeks in our in-stock rates at store level. And these are not just on our perpetual inventory system, but this has actually counted inventory from our inventory -- our Washington inventory group that takes our yearly fiscal inventory. \n So these are real counts, if you will, real out of stocks and not just out of stocks on the shelf, but out of stocks in the back room, too, so meaning it is not in the system for the consumer at all. So we saw a meaningful drop in that, meaning more available to the consumer. \n We believe as we move through the rest of this quarter and into the first, we're going to make even further meaningful advances. Why? We're putting hours toward the inventory specialist role that I mentioned earlier. This is a first for Dollar General to go in and ensure that we keep our on hand or our perpetual inventories more accurate than we have in the past. \n We've done this activity in the past, but we have come up with and we are teaching and training individuals to do this in a little bit of a different way, taking a fresh look at it, a fresh approach at it, doing more areas of the store on a weekly basis at a time to ensure that we touch every SKU. \n And by the way, touching every department of the store at least once a month and the higher velocity areas more than once a month. So we feel good about the direction. We feel good about how we will be able to quickly pivot and make some adjustments here.\n Now on the SKU rationalization side. I would tell you that -- and we've said this in the past, we've got between 11,000 and 12,000 total SKUs in our store today, depending on the format, right? We've got some larger formats, as you know, than our smaller ones. \n But we believe we have an opportunity to take out a meaningful number of SKUs. I'm not going to give you the number right now. We're still in the midst of looking at that. And how we're looking at it again is from that secondary and tertiary type areas that I talked about it earlier. \n We're also, though, taking a fresh approach to look to it from a standpoint of return, right? And so not only a GMROI look at it, but also looking at it from the standpoint of shrink and other areas of components that go into a SKU. And is it still profitable? With shrink being elevated, so a lot of it in our control, some not in our control. There may be SKUs -- and by the way, there are SKUs that we'll be dropping due to the amount of shrink that is in our store as well. \n So it's going to be a fresh look across the portfolio SKUs we carry with the consumer in mind first, but also profitability in mind throughout the entire supply chain through our stores. So more to come. I think we can give you a little bit more color as we go into Q1 of next year on both our progress as well as maybe contextualize how meaningful we're talking about here. But rest assured, I wouldn't talk about it on this if I didn't believe it was going to be a meaningful number of SKUs and a meaningful impact to the simplification efforts within our stores. Thank you, and thanks for all the questions and your kind words for welcoming me back. As I said last year that serving this team at Dollar General has been the highlight of my professional career, and I feel the same sense of honor today. \n As you heard this morning, we have some hard work yet ahead of us but we know what to do. We've done it before, and we are absolutely set on doing it again as quickly as possible. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and all that we've accomplished together over the years and will continue to do so for our customers, associates and shareholders. Thank you for listening, and I hope you have a great day."

            "name": "Kelly Dilts",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \n For third quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29%, a decrease of 147 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in shrink, lower inventory markups and increased markdowns. These were partially offset by decreases in LIFO and transportation costs. \n Turning to SG&A, which was 24.5% of sales, an increase of 183 basis points. This increase was driven by retail labor, including approximately $29 million of our targeted labor investment as well as depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance, rent, professional fees, other services purchased, including debit and credit card transaction fees. These were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. \n Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the third quarter decreased 41.1% to $433.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 4.5%, a decrease of 330 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $82 million compared to $54 million in last year's third quarter, driven by higher average borrowings and higher interest rates. \n Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% and compares to 22.8% in the third quarter of last year. This lower rate is primarily due to increased benefits from federal employment tax credits and an increased benefit from rate-impacting items caused by lower earnings before taxes for the third quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a higher state effective tax rate. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 45.9% to $1.26. \n Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3% compared to last year and a decrease of 1.8% on a per store basis. In addition, total nonconsumable inventory decreased approximately 15% compared to last year and decreased 19% on a per store basis. \n While the inventory growth rate has significantly moderated from its peak in the third quarter last year and the quality of our inventory remains good, we continue to believe there is opportunity to optimize and reduce our inventory levels. We continue to review our markdown plans related to the previously announced $95 million investment, including associated costs to ensure we are maximizing the impact of these actions. \n We are focused on optimizing our overall inventory position to better support our customers, stores, distribution centers and growth plans. Year-to-date, through Q3, the business generated cash flows from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of 15.5%. \n Total capital expenditures through Q3 were $1.2 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. \n During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $129.5 million. As planned, we did not repurchase shares this quarter. \n Now I want to take a moment to provide an update on our financial outlook. We continue to expect the following for fiscal year 2023. First, net sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Next, same-store sales in the range of a decline of approximately negative 1% to flat, and EPS in the range of $7.10 to $7.60 or a decline of negative 34% to negative 29%. Our EPS guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Finally, we expect capital spending in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, and no share repurchase activity. \n Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for the rest of 2023. While we continue to see a more constrained consumer and softer sales trends than we expected coming into the year, those trends were anticipated when we provided our guidance update in October. \n We have always been an all-weather brand and aided by the actions that Todd outlined earlier, we are poised and ready to serve our customer in this challenging economic environment. In the near term, we expect continued overall pressure on the sales line, particularly in the nonconsumable categories. \n Within gross margin, in addition to sales mix pressure in our previously announced markdowns, shrink has continued to be a sizable headwind, and we expect this will remain with us into next year as any shrink improvement typically takes at least a year from a store's most recent count to show up in our financial results. \n Partially offsetting these challenges, we expect benefits from greater distribution center capacity and performance, lower carrier rates, our private tractor fleet and other distribution and transportation efficiencies. We also continue to expect realizing benefits from our initiatives, including DG Fresh and the DG Media Network. \n Turning to SG&A. We plan to make the remaining $50 million of our planned total labor investment of approximately $150 million in our stores during Q4. Overall, the investments we have previously discussed in retail labor markdowns and other areas to better support our customers, stores and distribution centers are expected to total up to $270 million in 2023, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We are reviewing every aspect of these investments to ensure we maximize their impact for our customers and stores while driving the greatest return moving forward. \n Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and guide us today. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. \n Next, we return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment. And finally, over time, and when appropriate, share repurchases. Although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in order to support our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. With all of that said, cash generation is very important, particularly in this environment, and we are focused on maintaining and improving strong cash flow as we head into 2024. \n In summary, we remain committed to maintaining our discipline and how we manage expenses and capital as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. \n With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. Thanks, Todd. And just so everybody knows, our goal is certainly to get back to the historic levels of operating margin and profit that we're used to. While we're not going to give guidance, obviously, for '24 today, I do want to give a little bit of color of '24 just around some near-term headwinds that we're seeing. \n The first of those is around lapping really significantly reduced incentive compensation as well as stock-based compensation. And so that will just be a near-term headwind as we think about 2024. \n The other thing that we're looking at right now is we're expecting a higher effective tax rate. And that's really due to lower benefits around the stock-based compensation piece as well as we've seen historically just some higher state effective tax rates as we have moved through the last few years. \n So those are near-term headwinds, certainly not anything long term that we need to worry about. \n The other thing is around shrink. And so as you know, shrink has been pretty significant for us for a while, and it's definitely going to carry into 2024. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, it just takes a while to start showing up in your financial results. \n And just to give you a little bit more color of kind of where we are with shrink on a year-to-date basis. Shrink is actually 100 basis point headwind for us. And then as we moved into Q3, it's actually running just a little bit higher than that. And so certainly a pressure near term for us, something that we're looking to hopefully -- we're mitigating along the way, and it'll show up in the financial results later in 2024. \n And then as we think about just our underserved customers, we're just making sure that we're watching her and whether she gains -- stays gainfully employed. All the actions that Todd just noted and getting back to the basics is certainly going to set us up nicely to be able to serve her and it doesn't matter what economic environment. And we've always been an all-weather brand, and we certainly will continue to be so as we move forward. \n So that's a little bit of color on '24. We're going to give you a lot more color in March and give you a little bit more holistic view there. But what I'll say is, overall, the fundamentals of this business are absolutely unchanged and this model remains strong. And on a longer-term basis, we believe that we're going to get back to the historic levels that this model is accustomed to delivering. Yes. No, absolutely. And so an 18% return in this environment is fabulous, and Todd noted it, it's still a great use of capital. The new unit economics are still very strong as we move into '24. And it has a great payback period still of less than 2 years. \n And the other thing that we haven't seen is any change in the cannibalization rate. The other thing I'd point out and Dollar General is just fantastic at this. Our real estate group is pretty amazing, and we have an extremely high hit rate of success and you've seen that over the years. So we feel really good about the projects. We feel good about the 18% return, and of course, as Todd noted, while we're pleased with all of that in typical Dollar General fashion, we're going to work to improve it as we go through '24. Yes. No, thanks for the question. And inventory reduction is absolutely a priority of ours this year, and it will be a priority as we move into next year. I think the good news for us is that the quality of our inventory is good, but we've talked a lot in the past about the benefits of inventory reduction and just what that does as you reduce the complexities in both the stores and the distribution centers. \n So I would say our progress is on track in our reduction efforts, and you saw a little bit of that in the numbers today. So total inventory increase was 3% on a year-over-year basis. But if you look at it on a per store basis, we're down 1.8%. I think the real story here is, is around the nonconsumable piece. And so we are down 15% on a year-over-year basis there, and we're down 19% on a per store basis. \n I think the other important thing to call out, and we've been calling it out every quarter, but this one is even more significant as we've seen a 58% decrease in our import receipts. And again, that's us buying around that product and making sure that we're selling through it. And so we feel good about where we're headed for the end of the year. \n Just a little bit longer term, I'd say we have several work streams in place that are working on inventory reduction, but just as important, and this kind of goes to the top line is inventory optimization and making sure that we're going where the customer wants us to go. \n And so I would say with all of these things in place, we should feel pretty good about where we're landing at the end of '23, but we're going to feel even better as we see continued improvement in inventory levels as we move through '24."

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution, particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams worked diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas. In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross donating gift cards and through our own Employee Assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later. But importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead. For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate. Turning to our third quarter performance. On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3 compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continued to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable products sales during the quarter and also grew market share in non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item. Customer traffic also increased of 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continued to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October and was positive in all three periods of the quarter. Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top-line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior. We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted through throughout the third quarter and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year. With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our Back to Basics work, which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenience proposition, we believe over the longer term we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results.\nKelly Dilts: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd's taken you through a few of the top-line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact. Now turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months. While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits offset by the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well. We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in stock levels and drive sales while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52% as we continue to improve our working capital position primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter. Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs. Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of five fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations. Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and, over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress. To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our Back to Basics efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and look at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain. We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits and, more importantly, our customers are telling us as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores. This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate. We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries with which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points and in-full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates. In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity and, in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited four more facilities in Q3 for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs. Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping to stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility. Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year we began the first full scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front. And as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items store wide during the holiday season and low opening price points including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1. To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year, as Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year and we are well on our way to meeting that goal with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms. Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50% compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas and we believe we are well positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward. I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers and then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March. First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September and we are currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores and the learnings from that initiative and our own customer work have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering. With our unique customer base, we believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General while still providing the value they need. We are quickly learning and refining our process and, over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience at Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025. With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within five miles or less of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America. As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year. More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels and an additional 2,250 Project Elevate remodels and 45 relocations, and we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico. With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format, which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average. We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer facing areas in the store. Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels and, in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lists in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores. As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio including performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years and new store returns which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20%-plus. As we discussed for our 2024 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General branded stores in the U.S. As we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities and nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products and we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year isn't the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth. In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan, and we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025 as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders. As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey. Good morning, Todd and Kelly. My question is on the...\nTodd Vasos: Good morning.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning. The comp algorithm. How does it move now that you're mixing to a higher level of remodels versus store growth? It sounds like you could get almost a point of remodelled lift, assuming they continue to grow at the rate you expect over the next few years. Where does the comp algorithm land? And then consequently, if it's a little lower than what DG is used to, does -- how much does the cost structure need to evolve? It sounds like you're making progress in a lot of areas. Some of the supply chain may take a little bit longer, but can you match that cost structure so that you can deliver some of the former earnings growth prior to the last couple of years?\nKelly Dilts: Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do. Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move the year. So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Have you seen enough progress with improved execution as well as the mitigation in shrink for you to see line of sight to restoring double-digit EPS growth in 2025 despite having some incentive comp recurring next year?\nTodd Vasos: Michael, this is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on Back to Basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March. But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work, because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had. Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right. We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can. So we'll continue to work hard, not only on Back to Basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So Todd, have you seen any notable change in consumer spending or behavior between consumables and discretionary from your low-income customer? Maybe could you talk to top-line trends that you've seen in November, maybe relative to same-store sales in the third quarter? And then, Kelly, just with the heightened promotional backdrop, I think you cited, now expected at least through year end. How best to think about gross margin puts and takes in the fourth quarter, maybe notably markdown?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you a very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3. So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf. As a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our non-discretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store. As a matter of fact, value that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet. And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being -- the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope. We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side. It's just -- she's been very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween. So let -- not the candy side while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday. And while there's a lot of selling left and, unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we are optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant. And that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that it's probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it. On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we are capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that. The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses. And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations. So that didn't really change much. And neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages. So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Todd and Kelly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the same-day delivery pilot. What have you learned so far from there? How much of that cost your consumer, if they would like the added convenience of that program? And how are you thinking about the margin implications, either passing on the cost of that to the consumer or absorbing those? And just kind of big picture thoughts about what that could add to the DG kind of growth profile going forward?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thank you for the question. We are excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2. And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running. I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating towards it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly. And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us, one, we want convenience. Two, we want an opportunity to always save money. And then third, believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that comes specialized offering. So we're able to also offer that through this through this delivery means. The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores. It could marry very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time. We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it. And with that comes low cost to both our customer and to Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others. So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering, we're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network. And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece. And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top-line and bottom-line perspective will produce for Dollar General.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go towards FY 2025. Any initial puts and takes you can provide? I know your incentive comp could normalize. There could be some hurricane expense benefit. And including that, any initial thoughts on CapEx spend just given the significant increase in real estate products anticipated next year? Thank you.\nKelly Dilts: Yes, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will pressure on 2025. The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries. So we are seeing, and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025. And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the CapEx, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation. I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we are expecting right now is a CapEx that would be similar to this year's CapEx as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nZhihan Ma: Hi, Todd and Kelly. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on the remodeling side of things. Maybe a two-part question. One, I believe you historically mentioned that the DGTP remodels had an 8% to 11% comp sales lift that compares to the 6% to 8% you were mentioning today. So has there been any update on that front? And secondly, in terms of the mix of remodels versus new stores going forward, is 2025 a good model for the next couple of years as we think about the medium to longer term? Thank you.\nKelly Dilts: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right. We had quoted 8% to 11% last year. What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler accounts, and so that impacts top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns. So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns. So anytime you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts.\nTodd Vasos: Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base, and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base. We are excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come. We are just starting the journey. But the great thing about the Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, they'll see in this project elevate. So excited about it. We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Todd, you had mentioned last quarter that of the share gain that was up for grabs at the time that you didn't quite get your fair share, I know there's still been quite a few door closures in Q3 and we were wondering if you've seen any change with what you've seen with those opportunities this quarter?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. Interestingly, we -- what we've seen is a little bit of a rebound of that. Matter of fact, our mid- to high-end consumer, we gained share once again in Q3. So happy to see that start to bounce back. So it's interesting how the consumer is reacting. She's being a little finicky. But at the end of the day, value always wins. It appears. And so she's starting to seek more and more value. So good to see that customer that's available out there in the marketplace that we were able to capture more of our fair share this quarter than we did last. And we've got our sights set on that. Very same type of dynamic as we move through Q4 here and into early 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Hey. Thanks very much. Good to talk to you. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the actual dollars going into the standard remodels versus Project Elevate, and also what the return profile -- actual return is, as you calculate it? I know it's probably a little early on Project Elevate, but curious if you could give color on both of those.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. So for our traditional remodels, we're expecting a similar investment on the capital expenditure side. And I would tell you on Project Elevated is significantly less than that. So that's why it fits really nicely into our capital allocation structure. On the returns, we will -- you're right on Project Elevate a little early, but I will tell you that what we are contemplating are IRRs that are significantly higher than our new store IRRs and are relatively in line with the traditional remodels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on the gross margin. The trend is improving, down less this quarter than prior quarters. As you think about some of the tailwinds such as shrink on paper that should build into the fourth quarter and into next year, can you speak about that? And how you're thinking about gross margin expansion year over year, starting in the fourth quarter? And maybe just in general, how you think about the recoverability of the gross margin from here? Thanks so much.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well. So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey. And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financial statements just because as we take inventory through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hey, guys. So historically, when your core customers been pressured, it's usually resulted in higher traffic, but lower ticket as folks buy less become in more frequently. Today, we're seeing the opposite happen with traffic dropping in the last few quarters. Todd, why do you think that is playing out that way? And would you expect that to change at some point?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. We are squarely focused as always on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost, I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from LY. So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously. But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we are never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch. The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well. So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's been very, very frugal with that spend. And when she spends it. So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey. Thanks, guys. Curious when you do a remodel, how much of that expected comp lift is traffic versus conversion versus ticket? And then second, on that shrink opportunity on the gross margin line, I'm curious if there's an offset on the SG&A line? And then, Kelly, maybe just high level, how you're thinking about SG&A leverage point for next year?\nTodd Vasos: Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yeah, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, it -- your uptick happens from the offering itself. So more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds. So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels.\nKelly Dilts: And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically. A 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Grom: Thanks. Good morning. Good progress. Todd, just how are you thinking about the company's operating margin structure over time? It looks like if we back out the hurricane costs, you're going to exit this year a little bit around 5%. Can you improve on that over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like the business needs to see some investments both from labor and maybe price before you build from there?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we are pleased where we came out here in Q3. As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there. We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about 2025 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do. Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respect of how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point. I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there. And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned, that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?\nKelly Dilts: Yeah. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time. We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction. We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about and delivery could certainly play a big role in that. You've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital. Supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today, and then, of course, our save-to-serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow, which does allow us to invest in the business and you say that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project to Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth. So while we're not ready to commit to a time line or, of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session and also conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter execution, particularly in light of significant impact of multiple hurricanes in the Southeast during the quarter. Before discussing our results, I want to express my appreciation for our team's tremendous efforts to serve our hometown communities following these storms. As an essential retailer and often the most convenient source of products our customers need, our teams worked diligently to reopen the stores as soon as we could safely do so in the impacted areas. In addition, we have helped those in need through the donations to the American Red Cross donating gift cards and through our own Employee Assistance Foundation. We further embrace the opportunity to help in recovery efforts by donating truckloads of products in these communities. Kelly will discuss the financial impact of these storms on our results later. But importantly, our thoughts remain with those impacted communities and we will continue to seek opportunities to partner with them in the months ahead. For today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q3 performance. After that, Kelly will share the details of our financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2024. I will then wrap up the call with an update on our Back to Basics work before discussing our new same-day delivery pilot and our real estate plans for 2025, including Project Elevate. Turning to our third quarter performance. On the top line, while our core customer remains financially constrained, our results came in near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion in Q3 compared to net sales of $9.7 billion in last year's third quarter. Importantly, we continued to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable products sales during the quarter and also grew market share in non-consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the quarter and was primarily driven by growth of 1.1% in average transaction amount, including increases in average items per basket and average unit retail price per item. Customer traffic also increased of 0.3% during the quarter. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by growth in our consumable category as customers continued to focus their spending on the items they need most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in October and was positive in all three periods of the quarter. Notably, the last full calendar weeks of both August and September were the weakest of the quarter, suggesting that our customers continue to face significant financial pressure as they are less able to stretch their budgets at the end of the month. While we saw an uptick in pre-hurricane sales in areas forecasted to be impacted, we believe it was largely offset by periods of store closures following the storms. As a result, we believe the net impact of our top-line results was immaterial. I mentioned our core customers continue to face significant financial pressure, which is having an impact on our shopping -- on their shopping behavior. We see this pressure in the timing of their shopping during the month as well as in the mix of products they're buying. We know that they need value and we are working hard to deliver for them every day. We continue to feel very good about our everyday low price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the heightened promotional environment persisted through throughout the third quarter and we anticipate that it will continue for at least the duration of the year. With that said, we continue to focus on enhancing our unique combination of value and convenience. We believe our results demonstrate that we have made significant progress in our Back to Basics work, which I will discuss in more detail in just a bit. Importantly, as we continue to improve our execution and enhance our value and convenience proposition, we believe over the longer term we can capture even more incremental market share, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Before I discuss our plans to achieve these goals, I'll turn the call over to Kelly to share more on the financial details of our third quarter results. Thank you, Kelly. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on our Back to Basics efforts in our stores, supply chain and merchandising. When I spoke with you one year ago and announced this plan, we noted that our customers rely on Dollar General to provide the products they need at great values in convenient, friendly and easy-to-shop stores. And when we step back and look at our business through the eyes of the customer, we weren't meeting that goal consistently across our chain. We laid out several important goals for the team to address these concerns, and I'm proud to note we have made substantial progress executing on these objectives and improving the overall customer experience. With that in mind, I want to share a little about our progress in each area. I'll start with our stores, where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our goal in our stores is to deliver value and convenience in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have made significant progress on this front with a meaningful increase in the number of stores that we believe meet or exceed our expectations as well as those of our customers. As we view our stores through the eyes of the customer, we have seen this notable improvement continue to develop in our own unannounced store visits and, more importantly, our customers are telling us as they have noted this improvement through our survey results at checkout. Notably, as of the end of Q3, customer satisfaction levels have increased by more than 900 basis points since Q1 when we first had these surveys available in the majority of our stores. This coincides with improving in-stock levels, which increased approximately 180 basis points from Q3 of 2020 through to the end of Q3 of 2024. These results are a testament to the hard work of the team as well as the focus on increasing the front-of-store employee presence and sharpening our perpetual inventory management in our stores. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant contributions to our efforts in the store by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which enhances both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to help drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associate. We still have work to do, but we're proud of the progress in the stores over the last year and we continue to be pleased with the associate and customer response to these efforts. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to continue to elevate the in-store experience. Let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries with which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly improved OTIF levels in Q3 compared to the same time last year. Notably, we have improved our on-time deliveries by approximately 470 basis points and in-full rates by approximately 900 basis points over that period. We continue to be pleased with what we have seen in both our traditional and fresh supply chain, but believe we have room for further improvement. As a reminder, as we drive our OTIF rates higher, we simplify the work inside of our stores, which ultimately results in a better overall experience for both our customers and associates. In addition, we have continued making good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity and, in fact, have been able to accelerate our plans to exit temporary warehouse facilities. We exited four more facilities in Q3 for a total of 15 within the last 12 months. This will leave us with three remaining opportunities, all of which we plan to exit in 2025. By closing these temporary facilities, we are able to improve overall efficiency in our supply chain while also reducing costs. Meanwhile, we've augmented our permanent DC footprint with two new facilities in Colorado and Arkansas, each of which is open and now shipping to stores. By the end of this year, we anticipate these efforts will result in year-over-year reductions in stem miles of approximately 4% or greater in both our fresh and traditional supply chains. I also want to note that we implemented an automated system that utilizes advanced technology to store and retrieve products in our Arkansas DC. As a reminder, we added automation in a DC for the first time last year in South Carolina and have been pleased with the performance and results in that facility. Over time, we believe automation in these facilities can increase efficiency for our teams, optimize storage in the facility and drive even greater inventory and order accuracy to further enhance the way we serve our stores. Finally, earlier this year we began the first full scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front. And as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on our merchandising efforts. As a reminder, our top priority is providing meaningful value to our customer. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including strong everyday low prices on national and private brands, compelling promotions and sales events such as our DG Deal Days, which featured discounts on more than 6,000 items store wide during the holiday season and low opening price points including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1. To that end, comp sales in our Value Valley section of the store, which is comprised of a variety of items at the $1 price point, outperformed the rest of the store in Q3 by more than 600 basis points. We have also continued our strong progress in total inventory reduction this year, as Kelly previously noted, with a 3% overall decrease and a 7% decrease on a per store basis, all while improving in-stock levels and growing sales. Earlier this year, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year and we are well on our way to meeting that goal with the vast majority of these items already out of the planograms. Finally, our merchants have continued working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside of our stores. For example, we recently reached an important goal by completing the reduction of the number of floor stands by approximately 50% compared to Q3 of last year. As demonstrated by these results, Back to Basics has a significant positive impact on our business over the last year. While we still have room to improve, we have made substantial progress in each of our three priority areas and we believe we are well positioned to continue advancing this progress moving forward. I'm excited about the work we have done to solidify our foundation and position us to deliver even stronger customer experience in 2025 and beyond. With that in mind, while we are committed to executing on these basics at even a higher level as we move forward, we are excited to progress our discussion beyond Back to Basics and focus on our initiatives and plans to drive growth and value for customers and shareholders. I'll share a couple of updates today on how we are enhancing the value and convenience proposition in new and exciting ways for our customers and then we expect to share more of our plans for 2025 on our Q4 call in March. First, I'm excited to announce that we began a test of same-day home delivery from our stores during the quarter. This pilot launched in September and we are currently partnering with a third party to offer delivery through our DG app from approximately 75 stores. As a reminder, we have a highly successful and incremental delivery partnership with DoorDash in approximately 16,000 of our stores and the learnings from that initiative and our own customer work have provided the foundation from which to test our own delivery offering. With our unique customer base, we believe this offering will even further enhance the convenience of our customers expect from Dollar General while still providing the value they need. We are quickly learning and refining our process and, over time, we believe we can have delivery through the DG app available the same number of stores as our DoorDash offering, which we expect to continue expanding over time. We are excited about the opportunity for our customers. Our goal is to drive greater customer loyalty within the digital platform while ultimately increasing market share and accelerating growth. Next, as we look to extend and enhance the unique combination of value and convenience at Dollar General, I want to discuss our plans for real estate growth in 2025. With more than 20,000 stores across 48 states, Dollar General is located within five miles or less of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. And with approximately 80% of these stores in towns of 20,000 or fewer people, we are uniquely positioned to serve an underserved customer in rural America. As we look to leverage our real estate strength, we plan to increase the number of real estate projects next year. More specifically, we continue to see very strong returns in our remodel projects. We are expanding and enhancing our efforts to impact our mature stores. Accordingly, the growth in projects this year is focused on our remodels while continuing to balance our portfolio and capture growth opportunities through a significant number of new stores as well. With that in mind, in fiscal 2025, we plan to execute approximately 4,885 projects, including 575 new store openings in the U.S., 2,000 full remodels and an additional 2,250 Project Elevate remodels and 45 relocations, and we plan to open up to 15 additional stores in Mexico. With regards to our remodels, we are revamping our approach to further improve the shopping experience and elevate our brand through our mature store base. In our full remodels, we are increasing the scope of work to include additional upgrades and refreshes to the physical store assets. We expect more than 80% next year to be in our DGTP format, which will continue to allow for incremental cooler counts to provide a fuller shopping trip for our customers. We continue to expect average returns in our remodels that are consistent with what we have seen historically and are even greater than what we have seen from our new stores, driven by expected first year comp sales lifts in our full remodels of approximately 6% to 8% on average. We are also introducing a new remodel approach that is incremental to our full remodel program in order to expand the number of mature stores we impact each year. We are calling this incremental remodel initiative Project Elevate and our goal is to bolster performance in portions of the mature store base that are not yet old enough to be part of the full remodel pipeline. These projects will include nearly all of the same assortment updates as our full remodels other than cooler expansion and the addition of produce. Notably, they will include planogram optimizations and expansions across the store, updated adjacencies and physical asset refreshes in most prominent customer facing areas in the store. Our investment in these stores will be less than our full remodels and, in turn, our goal is to drive first year comp sales lists in the range of approximately 3% to 5% in these projects. We believe our customers will respond very favorably to these updates in their local stores and ultimately believe that this will enhance the associate and customer experience in our mature stores while also driving incremental sales growth. Turning to our new stores. As a reminder, we monitor the following five metrics of our portfolio including performance against pro forma sales expectations; new store productivity compared to the mature store base; cannibalization, which overall has remained consistent and predictable; cash payback, which we continue to expect in approximately two years and new store returns which we expect to be approximately 17% on average in 2025. I want to note that our expectations for new store returns, while still very strong, have been down modestly from our historic targets of 20%-plus. As we discussed for our 2024 pipeline, this change is also driven by higher new store occupancy cost as well as by higher operating costs. We continue to work to mitigate some of these higher costs where possible and continue to see significant opportunities for growth with approximately 12,000 opportunities for Dollar General branded stores in the U.S. As we said before, for a variety of reasons, we will not capture each of these opportunities, but we are pleased that the overall number of opportunities remains high. We anticipate that more than 80% of our new stores next year will be in one of our 8,500 square foot store formats and will predominantly be located in rural communities and nearly all of our relocations are planned for one of our 8,500 or 9,500 square foot stores. These stores continue to drive increased sales productivity per square foot as compared to our traditional 7,300 square foot box and also provide additional opportunities to serve our customers, including expanded cooler offerings, more health and beauty products and we anticipate adding fresh produce to approximately 300 new stores in 2025, bringing our expected total to approximately 7,000 by the end of next year. I also want to note that we do not plan to open any additional pOpshelf stores in 2025. We have continued to test and learn in our existing store base with new products and layouts, but in light of the current weaker customer shopping trends in discretionary categories, do not believe opening new stores in the coming year isn't the best use of our capital. Collectively, we believe our planned real estate projects will further solidify Dollar General as an essential partner to communities in rural America while strengthening our foundation to drive long-term sustainable growth. In closing, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the tremendous progress the team has delivered through our Back to Basics plan, and we are poised to continue building on that progress through the remainder of this year and into 2025 as we continue to strengthen the foundation for more meaningful growth in the future. With that in mind, I'm looking forward to sharing more about our plans and goals for 2025 and beyond in the months ahead. We are confident in this business and the actions we are taking to deliver value for our associates, customers and shareholders. As we move through our busy holiday season, I want to again thank our more than 195,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Good morning. Michael, this is Todd. Just real quickly, I do want to say that we're really pleased with the progress we have made on Back to Basics. Really excited about Project Elevate as well as other initiatives that we've either announced like home delivery or others that we're working on that we'll talk a little further about when we have our call in March. But in saying that, when you look in totality, we feel really good about being able to deliver on a lot of different aspects and lines. I'm very happy with the merch side as well as our operators and our DC pieces of the Back to Basics work, because it is laying that strong foundation for the future and getting back to where Kelly indicated, over the long term, those double-digit EPS algorithm growth models that we've traditionally have had. Now in saying that, we have still more work to do. We're never happy here at Dollar General, right. We want to capture as much growth as we possibly can. So we'll continue to work hard, not only on Back to Basics, but all the initiatives as we go forward. Yes. I'll start, Matt. Thanks for the question, and I'll pass it over to Kelly. From a consumer perspective, I would tell you a very similar consumer behavior as we exited Q2, as we did now exiting Q3. So very similar. Buying very close to need, being very selective at the shelf. As a couple of examples of our discretionary side as well as our non-discretionary side of the business. If you think about the core consumer, what we saw in Q3, private brand continues to do very well. Also our Value Valley area, which is that $1 offering up to 24 to 36 feet of product, depending on the size store. As a matter of fact, value that $1 offering was our best-performing category for the quarter as much as 600 basis points above the nearest category. So it really goes to show that the consumer is seeking value, trying to make ends meet. And then in our prepared remarks, we did talk about being -- the last week of the month being some of our weakest, right? And again, that just really proves that, that consumer is trying to make ends meet. Now some glimmers of hope. We did talk about some in Q2 and a little bit now in Q3. She is buying the discretionary side. It's just -- she's been very selective when she does and she's buying it very close to need. As an example, we were pretty pleased with our Halloween offering as well as the takeaway from the consumer on the discretionary side of Halloween. So let -- not the candy side while that was good as well, but the other side of that equation. So there is a lot of hope there. Our offering is solid for holiday. And while there's a lot of selling left and, unfortunately, five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we are optimistic on what that consumer will start to spend as we get a little closer in. Yes. Thank you for the question. We are excited about the pilot. We soft launched it very tail end of Q2. And now through Q3, we've got up to 75 stores up and running. I would tell you that we're testing, we're learning, we're refining both the native app and, of course, our website to make sure the experience is just right. But so far, the customer is gravitating towards it. It is something -- we do everything through the eyes of the customer here, Kelly. And I would tell you that as we launch this, the customer is saying to us, one, we want convenience. Two, we want an opportunity to always save money. And then third, believe it or not, they want that personalized experience. They don't want to stay anonymous. They want that. And because they know with that comes specialized offering. So we're able to also offer that through this through this delivery means. The great thing about the delivery piece, a few anecdotes as we just start here, is that it is something that's a little bit different than what you see in other offerings in that we are using a third party, so no labor expanded or expelled by our own folks. It's being done through a third party. Eventually, I believe it could -- it will be thousands of stores. It could marry very, very closely due to this third party, our DoorDash kind of offering that we have today, which we've been very happy with so far. So there's a lot of good news there and not a lot of burden on our stores. And as it relates to cost, again, we'll continue to refine that as well. But we've always said here, we're going to do delivery our way when it's time. We believe it's time. We believe that we are doing it our way, meaning the DG way, and the way that our Dollar General customer wants it. And with that comes low cost to both our customer and to Dollar General. And there's always ways to offset some of those costs that will be inherent in the delivery piece with the vendor community and others. So we feel good about the start of this. It will also -- the last thing I do want to mention, while the top line will benefit greatly eventually with this offering, we're also excited about the margin potential this has beyond just the product margin that we'll enjoy from it, but also our media network. And we've got a very robust media network today that we started to build years ago. And the one area that was lacking for us to really put it into hyperdrive, if you will, was the delivery piece. And now with that starting to emerge, we'll be able to leverage that media network to even greater heights. And so stay tuned. We're excited about what delivery in totality from a top-line and bottom-line perspective will produce for Dollar General. Yes. And I think I would also add on that, Kelly, that while we're not here to talk about the years ahead, but as you think about Project Elevate and our mature store base, and making sure that we're offering the customer exactly what she needs in the mature store base. We are excited about the opportunity that additional remodels every year could offer. If you think about it and you move in the next three to five years, you could essentially touch 80% to 90% of your store base, right, over time, on a much quicker basis, less than half the time, quite frankly, that we were -- we would have done so in the past. So more to come. We are just starting the journey. But the great thing about the Project Elevate, is -- and I just want to get you in the ballgame is the -- from a customer perspective, they see everything in Project Elevate that they would see in a normal remodel, less the additional coolers and produce. Everything else, the experience they see in a remodel, which they love today, they'll see in this project elevate. So excited about it. We'll talk, I'm sure, a lot more about it as we move through 2025. Yes. Interestingly, we -- what we've seen is a little bit of a rebound of that. Matter of fact, our mid- to high-end consumer, we gained share once again in Q3. So happy to see that start to bounce back. So it's interesting how the consumer is reacting. She's being a little finicky. But at the end of the day, value always wins. It appears. And so she's starting to seek more and more value. So good to see that customer that's available out there in the marketplace that we were able to capture more of our fair share this quarter than we did last. And we've got our sights set on that. Very same type of dynamic as we move through Q4 here and into early 2025. Yes. We are squarely focused as always on driving traffic. So that's, first and foremost, I think, is important. But as you start to think about the traffic number, this was the first quarter that we actually lapped a positive traffic number from LY. So we anticipated it softening as we move through this quarter from a year-over-year perspective, obviously. But we were happy with the traffic gains that we did see in the quarter, but we are never satisfied with where we are. We're always pushing more. Now the dynamic that you also indicated that the ticket being up is something to watch. The good thing is, is that a lot of that ticket that we saw was -- really came from some of the discretionary areas of the store. And so it is good to see that she's shopping that side as well. So more to come there. I believe, as I indicated earlier, that she has the money to spend, but she's been very, very frugal with that spend. And when she spends it. So we'll continue to watch that, but working hard to drive traffic through the back half of this year, which is -- or the back quarter of this year here in Q4, but also to start off the year on the right foot here in Q1. Yes, I'll start, Kelly, and I'll pass it over to you. Yeah, as we look at that remodel program, what we normally see in remodels is that normally, it -- your uptick happens from the offering itself. So more on the ticket side of the equation. And then as time goes, the traffic starts to pick up as well. So just like any remodel that we've done, we believe Project Elevate will probably fall into that same category because what will happen is word of mouth will get out that we've remodeled the store and then traffic normally builds. So it's usually ticket first and then traffic to come as we move through the months beyond those remodels. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Let me start, and I want Kelly to jump in as well. I would tell you that we are pleased where we came out here in Q3. As you look at our business, there is expense headwind that's there. We've got a lot of levers to be able to pull though as well into the future. While we're not here yet to talk about 2025 and beyond, I would tell you that we are squarely focused on achieving a better rate than where we are today that you mentioned. But we've got some work to do. Now I would also tell you, we feel good about the labor line from the respect of how many hours the stores have. We don't believe a big investment is still needed at this point. I do feel good about the hours we have and the ability of the stores to be able to produce from that. So we don't believe a big uptick there. And we don't see any huge upticks in other expense lines other than obviously, incentive pay and some of the other things that Kelly already mentioned, that will come back at us in 2025. Kelly?"

            "name": "Kelly Dilts",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd's taken you through a few of the top-line highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the other important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. For Q3, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.8%, a decrease of 18 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages and a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory markups, lower shrink and decreased transportation costs. Shrink was a year-over-year tailwind of 29 basis points in Q3, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While shrink rates as a percentage of sales continue to be higher than we would like to see in our stores, we are making progress as we work to get closer to pre-pandemic levels and believe our actions are having a positive impact. Now turning to SG&A. As a percentage of sales, it was 25.7%, an increase of 111 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were hurricane-related costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. As Todd noted, our stores have been heavily impacted by multiple hurricanes in recent months. While we believe the net impact of these storms was immaterial to both sales and gross margin, they resulted in a negative impact to SG&A of $32.7 million during Q3. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the third quarter decreased 25.3% to $323.8 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 3.2%, a decrease of 129 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $82 million in last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% and compares to 21.3% in the third quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to a decreased benefit from federal tax credits offset by the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.4% to $0.89. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7.1 billion at the end of Q3, a decrease of 3% compared to prior year and a decrease of 7% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 6% compared to last year and decreased approximately 9% on a per store basis. In addition to the financial benefit to our balance sheet, the significant improvement in our inventory position is having a positive impact operationally in our DCs and is beginning to positively impact our stores as well. We continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate mix and balance of inventory to improve in stock levels and drive sales while also mitigating shrink risk and improving working capital. Importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion through the end of the third quarter, an increase of 52% as we continue to improve our working capital position primarily through inventory management. In addition, we repaid our maturing $750 million of notes with cash during the quarter. Total capital expenditures in the 39-week period were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our updated guidance includes the negative impact of the hurricane-related expenses of $32.7 million in third quarter as well as an estimated Q4 negative impact of approximately $10 million from expenses related to the third quarter hurricanes as we continue to work through the necessary repairs. Hurricane-related expenses are significantly greater than what was contemplated in the company's previous financial guidance. Our updated guidance includes expected net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.8% to 5.1% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1.1% to 1.4%. These updated amounts contemplate our start to Q4 as well as the expected impact of five fewer holiday shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect pressure as a result of increased promotional markdown activity in the back half of the year as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance assumes current rates will continue for the remainder of the year, though we remain focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. With all of this in mind, we're updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $5.90. This guidance continues to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high-return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels and 85 relocations. Next, in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and, over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and Baa2. In summary, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. However, we still have significant room for improvement in our financial performance and we're staying focused on continuing to advance our progress. To achieve our goals, we remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We are confident in our business model and our ongoing long-term financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, meaningful operating margin expansion, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I think as we go forward, especially with the introduction of Project Elevate that we feel good that we can get back to the contribution that our real estate programs have given us on a comparable sales line. But with that, I'd also say you're absolutely right on the cost structure, and that's something we're focused on as we go forward into 2025 and beyond. Certainly, around shrink and damages, we've got a lot of focus on what that can do. Depreciation, that will play out over time and same will retail salaries as we move the year. So I would say we're going to focus on all those components, both top line and cost structure as we work to get back to our long-term double-digit EPS growth target. Yes. And just to give you a little bit more color on Q4. So what we're seeing as we move into November, obviously, the calendar shifts are pretty significant. And that makes 2019 the best comparison. And we did talk about that a little bit on the last call that it's probably if you take sales on a 2019 CAGR basis, that may be the best way to look at it. On a little color for November, we did come in slightly above the midpoint of our sales expectations for November. So certainly contemplated in our guidance, and there is a lot of selling season left, which is why we slightly narrowed our expectations of our previous sales guidance to make sure that we are capturing that. I'll tell you on the high end, what we're expecting is just kind of a macro neutral environment. And then on the lower end, it does provide for some softening of that. The other primary driver really of the guidance is around the hurricane-related expenses. And so you heard us talk about $33 million of pressure in the third quarter. And then we're expecting another $10 million of pressure from the same hurricanes in Q4, and that's really as we work to finish all of the repairs that we need to do on the stores that were impacted. To your question on the margin piece of that, the promo backdrop, it is a little bit elevated, but it's not anything outside of our expectations. So that didn't really change much. And neither did the other expectations around shrink or damages. So shrink is still considered to be a tailwind in Q4. Yes, Rupesh, thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we're not ready to give 2025 guidance yet, but I can absolutely give you a few of the puts and takes that we are taking a look at. So one of those pressures that's going to be going into 2025 is going to be incentive compensation. We'll give you a better idea of what that looks like when we have our conversations in March, but that will pressure on 2025. The other two pieces are pieces that you've seen put pressure on this year as well, which would be around retail salaries. So we are seeing, and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, some wage rate pressure. And so that continued into Q3 and will continue into Q4. We expect it could continue into 2025 or at least it would -- our exit rate would continue into 2025. And then, of course, depreciation and amortization, which has put pressure for the last couple of years. On the CapEx, I think we've done a really nice job of considering our capital allocation. I'm really excited about what we're doing around our remodels and being able to invest in our mature store base and the capital allocation that's associated with that. So with that in the new stores, what we are expecting right now is a CapEx that would be similar to this year's CapEx as a percentage of sales and making sure that we're investing in those high-return projects. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. And so yes, we are expecting a comp lift of around 6% to 8%. You're right. We had quoted 8% to 11% last year. What it is, is really a function of what is occurring in the remodels. So as the base has a higher cooler count, when we go to remodel those stores, we are not including as many cooler accounts, and so that impacts top line. What I will say, though, is that the IRRs are still better than the new store returns. So we're really pleased with where those are landing. And then now that we've got Project Elevate, we're looking to add an additional comp lift of 3% to 5%, again, with a great IRR on those projects as well, higher than our new store returns. So anytime you can touch that many stores, you always get a big positive, and so we're pleased to do both with those lifts. Yes. So for our traditional remodels, we're expecting a similar investment on the capital expenditure side. And I would tell you on Project Elevated is significantly less than that. So that's why it fits really nicely into our capital allocation structure. On the returns, we will -- you're right on Project Elevate a little early, but I will tell you that what we are contemplating are IRRs that are significantly higher than our new store IRRs and are relatively in line with the traditional remodels. Yes. I think shrink is probably our biggest opportunity. And so as we think about what the Q4 looks like, it should certainly add some benefit to the gross margin line. We have a -- we still have a lot of work to do, I would say, on shrink while we have made a ton of progress, and we think it will be a tailwind as we move into 2025 as well. So certainly pleased with the progress that we're making, but just want to call out that the shrink is really a continuous improvement journey. And just as a reminder, because of the long tail, it does take year for us to get the full impact of any actions that we take to show up in the financial statements just because as we take inventory through the year, that's when we'll get the benefit of that. And so that could be a little bit longer journey, but certainly should be a tailwind to 2025. Our goal is still to hit those pre-pandemic shrink levels, and we feel like we have a path to get there. And then on the shrink side, on 2025, I think it could be a big contributor to gross margin as we move into next year. On the SG&A leverage point, I think it still stays the same as where it's been historically. A 2% to 4% comp helps us get to that leverage point, and that's what we'd be looking for, and that's what we would want comps to build to over the longer term. Yeah. No, absolutely. And as you can hear, we're really managing this business for the long term and focusing on double-digit EPS growth. And we do think we can get back to that over the time. We've got still a lot of underlying long-term drivers in place, and that includes a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. And so that hasn't changed. We've got other long-term margin drivers. We think we've got a path to the shrink reduction. We have a path, we believe, to stabilizing the sales mix. And then we have DG Media Network, which we're really excited about and continue to be excited about and delivery could certainly play a big role in that. You've got private brands and global sourcing opportunities, our category management. I'm really excited about the potential of inventory optimization as we look in the future, both on the sales line and as well as what it gives us on working capital. Supply chain efficiencies with some of the automation that we talked about today, and then, of course, our save-to-serve approach of controlling costs and always being that low-cost operator. And then the other thing I would just point out is that we have been generating a significant amount of cash flow, which does allow us to invest in the business and you say that today with our real estate announcement and being able to invest even more in our existing stores at a rapid pace with Project to Elevate. So with all of those things in mind, we really do believe we've got a long-term opportunity to drive higher sales and margins that would support that double-digit EPS growth. So while we're not ready to commit to a time line or, of course, the guidance beyond 2024 at this time, we do think that, that double-digit EPS growth remains our long-term target, and we believe it's possible to achieve it."

Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our team for their continued dedication to serving our customers while executing our back-to-basics plan across the organization. This dedication was on full display at our leadership meeting earlier this month as we had the opportunity to host more than 1,500 leaders of our organization here at Nashville. This event served as a powerful reminder of the passion and talent of this team and the mission of serving others that unites us. On today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q2 performance, I will then share updates on our back-to-basics work as well as an update on our plans for the remainder of 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q2 financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for the full year. Turning to our second quarter performance. We continue to make important progress on our back-to-basics plan. However, we are not satisfied with our overall financial results. On the top line, net sales increased 4.2% and to $10.2 billion in Q2 compared to net sales of $9.8 billion in last year's second quarter. Importantly, despite a weaker sales environment for our core customer than we had anticipated, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 0.5% during the quarter, which was below our expectations. The increase was driven by a 1% growth in customer traffic and was partially offset by a 0.5-point decline in average transaction amount, which was driven by lower average unit retail price per item. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by the growth in our consumable category, as customers continue to focus their spending on the items, they need at most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in our seasonal home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in June before turning negative in July. Notably, the three softest comp sales weeks of the quarter were the last week of each of the calendar months. This pattern suggests that our customers are less able to stretch their budgets through the end of the month. With that in mind, as well as our continued softness in discretionary sales in our own customer data and survey work, we believe the softer-than-anticipated sales performance in Q2 is at least partially attributable to a core customer that is less confident of their financial position. I want to provide some additional context around what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. The majority of them state that they feel worse off financially than they were six months ago as higher prices, softer employment levels and increased borrowing costs have negatively impacted low-income consumer sentiment. As a result, our core customer who contributes approximately 60% of our overall sales comes predominantly from households earning less than $35,000 annually. Inflation has continued to negatively impact these households with more than 60% claiming they have had to sacrifice on purchasing basic necessities due to the higher cost of those items, in addition to paying more for expenses such as rent, utilities and health care. More of our customers report that they are now resorting to using credit cards for basic household needs and approximately 30% have at least one credit card that has reached its limit. And in our latest survey, 25% of our customers surveyed noted they anticipated missing a bill payment in the next six months. While middle- and higher-income households are seeking value as well, they don't claim to feel the same level of pressure as low-income households. As customers have felt more pressure on their spending, we have also seen corresponding elevation in the promotional environment beyond what we had anticipated coming into the year. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our everyday low-price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the increased promotional activity has pressured both sales and gross margin, and we anticipate this will likely continue for the duration of the year. That said, we remain committed to our back-to-basics strategy, which focuses on controlling the things that we can control, including a timely and accurate supply chain, in-store execution and customer-centric merchandising. With this in mind, we have already begun taking decisive action to respond and strengthen our position over the back half of the year. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on our back-to-basics progress, which is foundational to our future. And then I will discuss the actions we are taking to build on that progress and deliver a stronger customer experience. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our efforts in the stores have centered around further enhancing the customer experience to deliver the value and convenience they expect in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores, with our associates committed to providing friendly, welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers while also facilitating the positive checkout experience. We have also focused labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores in an effort to significantly improve our in-stock levels and support our sales growth. These efforts have paid dividends as we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our in-stock levels. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have also contributed to the in-store progress by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which should enhance both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates. We are proud of the progress in the stores, and pleased to see our actions continue to resonate with our team in the field as well as with our customers. And we are working hard to continue to advance our progress and further elevate the experience within our stores. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year, and we are pleased with what we have seen both in our traditional and fresh supply chains. We have also made good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity. As a reminder, we had previously announced plans to close 12 temporary facilities by the end of the year. We have already exited 11 of these buildings, and now believe we can close at least two more by the end of this year. While closing the less efficient temporary facilities, we have built and opened two new permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado. We expect both to ramp up operations in the coming months and to ultimately contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation costs over time. Finally, we are undertaking the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics of merchandising. Providing a meaningful value to our customer continues to be a top priority. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including a strong everyday low price on national and private brands, compelling promotions on sales events and low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1 every day. We have also continued to make strong progress reducing total inventory this year, which Kelly will discuss in more detail in a moment. In 2024, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. Finally, our merchants have done a fantastic job working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside the stores. For example, we have reduced the number of floor stands by approximately 25% through the first half of the year, and we anticipate removing more than 50% by the end of the year. Additionally, we have reduced the number of times we rotate some of our displays, allowing our store teams to spend more time engaging with our customers. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time within our stores for our teams and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. Overall, we are making nice progress as you have heard, and we are executing on the goals we have set for our team. And importantly, we believe we will continue advancing these efforts as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we believe our back-to-basic actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including on-shelf availability and convenience, further enhance the associate experience in stores, including improved employee engagement and retention, and ultimately drive improvements in financial results in 2025 and beyond. However, as I previously mentioned, we are not happy with our Q2 financial results. We know the retail landscape has continued to evolve in terms of the promotional environment and financial constraints felt by our customers, and we are taking immediate action to respond to serve them, while also positioning the business for growth and value creation. With all of that in mind, we are increasing our investment in markdown activity in an effort to support our customers, further drive customer traffic and improve sales. We are investing from a strong everyday price position to further support our customer and maintain a favorable competitive positioning. We believe this investment will work in conjunction with our back-to-basic efforts to further enhance our value and convenience proposition. In summary, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the operational progress we're making, and feel good about the actions we are taking to build on that momentum. We need to be at our best for our customers in times like this, and we are excited about the opportunity to serve them. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional value, and we have seen that when we do so consistently, we build strong brand loyalty that contributes to healthy share gains over the long term. And with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities with value and convenience. I am confident this team will continue to rise to the occasion and seize the opportunities in front of us to further enhance the way we serve our customers, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Dilts: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For the second quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30%, a decrease of 112 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and increased shrink. These factors were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. With regards to markdowns, we are now seeing promotional levels greater than we had anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are increasingly seeking value in their purchasing behavior in addition to an overall increased promotional environment. Shrink was a year-over-year headwind of 21 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And I want to note that while shrink continues to be a significant headwind, we are pleased with the progress we're making and believe our actions, including our self-checkout conversions, are having a positive impact. Turning to SG&A. It was 24.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 57 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were retail, labor, depreciation and amortization, store occupancy costs and utilities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter decreased 20.6% to $550 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.4%, a decrease of 168 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $84 million in last year's second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 20.2% to $1.70. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of second quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and a decrease of 11% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 13% compared to last year and decreased 17% on a per store basis. Importantly, we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. The team has done a nice job reducing our overall inventory position while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher in-stock levels. We will continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate balance of mix of inventory to drive sales while also mitigating shrink risk and improving our working capital. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion year-to-date, an increase of 127% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures for the 26-week period were $696 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. On the top line, we've updated our guidance to reflect our second quarter results as well as our expectations that the customer will continue to feel financial pressure for the duration of the year, and the promotional environment will remain elevated beyond what we had initially anticipated. With that in mind, we now expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.7% to 5.3% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1% to 1.6%. Turning to gross margin, we expect additional pressure as a result of the increased promotional markdown activity that Todd noted, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance now assumes no improvement in the back half of the year, though we are focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. And while we expect shrink to be a headwind for the full year, our results from the second quarter as well as positive trends in other metrics that are highly correlative to shrink, including inventory reductions, supporting our belief that we are moving in the right direction to continue mitigating this headwind. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see shrink begin to turn to a tailwind later in Q4 and then become a more material tailwind in 2025. Within SG&A, we are seeing an elevated rate of maintenance expense, particularly with HVAC units and coolers during the summer months. We're taking steps in the back half of the year to be more proactive in addressing these opportunities in order to provide a more consistent customer experience across our store footprint, while also supporting ongoing sales growth. As a result, we expect incremental pressure from the increased repairs and maintenance expense to continue within SG&A in the back half of the year. Finally, we are also seeing pressure from wage rate inflation closer to approximately 4% this year, which is higher than was contemplated in our initial guidance for the year. With all of this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $6.20. This guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver on our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels, and 85 relocations. Next in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment, and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. In summary, while we're not satisfied with the financial results for the second quarter, we are pleased with the continued progress in our back-to-basics work, and we believe we're taking the necessary actions to build on this progress and drive the business forward. We remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. And we continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. I want to emphasize that we're confident and excited about the long-term future of this business, including driving profitable same-store sales and deliver meaningful operating margin expansion while generating healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me say again that 2024 is about executing on our foundational back-to-basics plan, and we are pleased to be on schedule and making great progress against the goals we have previously outlined. We are confident that the actions we are taking will strengthen our foundation for the long term. This team is energized and laser-focused on our strategy to restore operational excellence while delivering value for our customers and shareholders alike. I want to close by thanking our more than 193,000 employees for their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others. It is a privilege to serve alongside them each and every day, and we are looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the back half of the year. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Todd, the market is saying that Dollar General and the small box value model is to simply structurally challenge either because there's too many stores, it's not as sufficiently exposed to the online channel or not attracting enough incremental customers perhaps due to competition. So why is that wrong? And as you are trying to invest in markdown and promotions to regain customers, how do you build back the margin over time? Is it simply a function of leveraging sales growth?\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Michael, and I appreciate the question. Yes, I fundamentally -- we fundamentally don't believe at all that the model is structurally challenged. But there are challenges to the business as this quarter indicated. Let me first start by saying that our new store productivity as well as our strong returns in new stores continue to serve us well. We continue to gain market share with these new store openings. And cannibalization with these new stores continue to be very much in line to where it's been historically. So, we don't believe that by slowing down to any large degree new stores would be the answer here. What we do believe is that this quarter, in particular, with a 0.5 point of comp versus last quarters of a fairly strong 2.4% comp, as I look at what transpired here, I would tell you that it appears to us very strongly that, one, this lower end consumer continues to be very much financially strapped especially as it relates to her ability to feed our families and support her families. As I look at our results throughout the quarter, I would tell you that, from our perspective, the last week of the calendar month of each of the calendar months was the weakest by far. When you couple that with private brand being as strong as it is for us, our value, value, which, as you probably recall, Michael, is our $1 or below offering inside of our store, which by the way, still 2,000 items, we've never walked away from that $1 price point. It is, by far, the strongest planogram that we have out there. And I would tell you that all those points would indicate that this is a cash strapped consumer right now, even more so than what we saw in Q1. Now what we also saw was that while we're not losing share, we're actually gaining share against all classes of trade in the consumable realm, what we did see in the quarter, which was different than last quarter, is the available share to take, if you will, out there from other cohorts. We didn't get our fair share of that. Now we didn't lose, right? We're not seeing any one competitor, mass or anywhere else, take our core customer. But what we did see was, at least in this quarter, the mass channel, especially those that are down south actually did a lot better in gaining the share that was available in the marketplace. We didn't get our fair share of that. So, what are we going to do about it? Well, it's exactly what we talked about in our prepared remarks. We go on the offense, and we've done that very successfully here over the years, Michael, as a merchant. And now as the CEO of this company, we know how to do this. And we're ratcheting that up as we speak. We believe that the share that's available out there, we have every right to get more than our fair share of that out there. So, we're working that really hard, and you heard that in our prepared remarks. So, I'd say that this box, this company and the small box in general is very much alive and well. We're just going through a little bit of a transition period and a transformation, as you know. And it's never usually a straight line to the top when you do these, right? And so, a few bumps in the road, but we feel that we know exactly how we can go about garnering that share that's available out there. And Kelly, you may want to take the second part.\nKelly Dilts: Yes, absolutely. So yes, just how do we build that margin back over time? I think it's important to call out, one, you nailed it. It's a softer sales environment. So, with the top line, that does put pressure on our fixed cost leverage, specifically labor and rent and those type of things as you well know. But as Todd talked about, I think, in the near term, one is just going on the offense and taking the markdown investment that we need to take on a go-forward basis to drive sales and to be there for our customer. And to kind of put that in context, I would say that what we're looking at in this back half is going to be markdown rate to what we saw last year in the back half as well. So more than we had anticipated, but absolutely the right decision and not necessarily one that we have to think about over the long term as that can come back in line when circumstances change. The other piece of this, and we've talked a lot about it, obviously, is shrink and mix headwinds. And so, we're certainly experiencing those. Although, I think we have a lot of good news here to report on the shrink side of things starting to see that trend bend. It just takes a while to flow that through the financial statements. And then, the damage piece of this as well is putting a little pressure on the second half. But again, all the things that we're doing on a back-to-basics efforts are going to help to mitigate that as well as just having a focused team on that. So, I think those are kind of the near-term things that we'll be dealing with that will get in line. And then over the long term, our underlying long-term drivers are still in place. We still have a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. We have higher returns with the opportunities that we have with our existing stores. And then you saw, this period, our cash from operations was up 127%. So, we are still generating a significant amount of cash flow, which gives us the ability to invest in the business. So, we feel good about the long-term potential of getting those margins back over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: I have two parts in one question. Todd, I want to ask if this transition period changes the way you think about reinvestment now going forward, thinking about all the levers of pricing and merchandising and labor, meaning that even if the business comes positive, that margins just stay subdued for an extended period of time while you get all the pieces in order. And then, the second part of it is, are there any cohorts of stores where it would make sense to rationalize them because they're under comping and/or they're margin dilutive to the overall chain?\nTodd Vasos: Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. And as we continue to move through this transformation period, obviously, as we said, it's never a straight line to the top. There's bumps in the road. The margin is one of those. As we've indicated right from the start, the biggest opportunity we have in the margin that's a differentiator than just a few years ago is in that shrink area. We believe we've got ample opportunity there to get our shrink back in line. As Kelly indicated in her prepared remarks, we're starting to see some benefit from all the work that we've done around that. And we still very much believe that it will turn to a tailwind as we move into Q4 and then much more substantial of a tailwind into '25. Now shrink is a constant battle, it's work every day, but it's that pick and showable work that we know how to do, and we know how to do very well here at Dollar General. The other thing I do want to point out, Simeon, is that, as we continue to move, I would tell you our back-to-basics plan has started to really show some signs of life here. And when I say that, when I look at our operations, as an example, we've been using a football analogy for the last few quarters. And I would tell you that we, across the 50-yard line last quarter in Q1, I would tell you, we're around the opponents 40-yard line at this point, which is good to see. We're making progress. We're making progress in a lot of fronts there, one being our staffing at the front ends, the reduction takeaway of the self-checkouts and moving those to assisted lanes, it was in full swing. Our customers are telling us they like it a lot more. Not surprising. They like the interaction instead of having to check out themselves. And we like what we see on that front. And I believe that's what's starting to show up on our shrink results as well in a positive manner. The other thing that we're working hard on, we're starting to see that shrink traction, as I talked about. We're also starting to see in-stocks better each and every quarter, really each and every period as we continue to move through. So, in-stocks are getting better. Our turnover inside of our stores at all levels of our operating group is getting better from our Regional Director, DM, Store Manager right down to the sales associates inside of our stores, which is usually a true testament that we're doing the right things for our employees, which in turn is normally the right thing for our customers. So, we believe that those are all green light. On our merchandising side, I'm very proud of the inventory reductions that took place on a same-store basis, especially 11% down in total inventory on a same-store basis, 16% down on a same-store basis in non-con and 7.6% decrease per store on a per store basis in consumables, all while driving greater share gains through our consumable categories. Where we're working hard is to continue to engage that consumer now through this promotional lever. We have a very strong everyday price out there. This will just lever on top of that. This will just lever on top of that. The other thing that I do want to talk about as well is that we've reduced -- in the process of reducing the 1,000 SKUs. That continues to do very well. We\u2019re well on track and we\u2019ll hit our goal by the end of this fiscal year in reducing the 1,000 core SKUs. And we're evaluating what that may look like in '25 for additional opportunities to continue to reduce that inventory level and simplify work at the store level. Off-shelf displays are down by 25%, as you heard in our prepared remarks in the first half, going to be down over 50% in the back half. And of course, all the work simplification that we've done, I think, is going to be very important. And lastly, our supply chain continues to really do well. When I think about where we are in the football field, we are down around the 30-yard line at this point, getting ready to get into the red zone here. And that is a true testament to the hard work of our supply chain, but also a cross-functional work of our operators and our merchants. Our on-time and in-full rates are exceeding our expectations into this coming quarter. And right now, what we're working on hard is making sure that we are consistent, right? Because consistency here is going to be the key. If I can deliver on time to our stores consistently, it gives them a full leg up and be able to work that seven-day workflow that we know, when executed at the store level, is a real positive for our stores in serving the customer each and every day. So, a lot of great things are going on. Yes, a little pressure on certain lines. We believe that our guidance is very prudent based on where that consumer is right now, and our transformation progress as well as where we want to make sure that we continue to drive that traffic. Very nice to see a positive 1% traffic gain still for the quarter. We're not happy with just the 1%, we're going to drive for more. But we know how to do this, Simeon. We've done it. We've proven that once we continue to back that consumer through tough times, she is there when the better times come and she is very sticky. And that's exactly how we're approaching it this time around.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss: Great. So, Todd, just to take the cadence of comps, maybe a step further, could you elaborate on underlying traffic versus ticket as the quarter progressed? Any concerns that are now more top of mind today relative to, call it, three months ago from your survey work on the low-income consumer? And have you seen any improvement in August comps?\nTodd Vasos: Yes. I don't want to talk too much about August, but I would tell you that what we've seen in -- so far in this quarter is in our guidance and feel that we're on track there. So very much I believe in that guidance that we put out there. Now I would tell you that while we're happy with the 1% that we gained on traffic. We believe there's more to gain there. And as I indicated in my first question answer there, I would tell you, Matt, that what we saw is the guys down in Bentonville are doing a pretty nice job in garnering the available traffic that's out there from other retailers. We haven't seen a deterioration on our side. But what we saw in Q1 was a greater pickup from the available share maybe from other classes of trade, grocery and drug. While we got some of it, we didn't get our fair share, at least what I would consider to be our fair share. And that's why we're attacking this and going on the offense. We believe that as we continue to be there for our customer in this regard will help us gain momentum into the back half of the year and hopefully a springboard into 2025. And Kelly, you may want to elaborate a little bit on the other side.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. No, absolutely. So yes, taking a look at second quarter comps on a cadence basis, so June was our strongest month and then it started to turn negative in July. And so, what we really saw kind of in that mid-quarter time frame just a general step down, and it was all around the transaction side of things to Todd's point. So, when we think about what we are contemplating as we went into Q2, I would tell you that on the basket side, we were pretty much in line with our expectations. It was on the transaction side, which is what the teams are going to run hard after driving sales and making sure that we get the customers the value that they need right now. So that's really the cadence. The other thing I think that's really important to point out is the of each of the calendar months were the softest comp weeks of the quarter. And for us, that really indicates that she started to run out of money by the end of the month. And what we saw in some of our survey work is just that our core customer says that they're feeling worse off financially than they did six months ago. And so, again, it just goes back to the point of in this back half, making sure that we're playing offense on driving sales and taking the markdown investment that we need to do.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: I have two quick ones. So first, on the guidance, is there any more conservatism than normal with this particular guide? And then, second, as you look at the promotional offers that you've done, I guess, in Q2 and then what you plan to do in the back half of the year, how is the consumer response versus your expectations versus what you typically see when you run these increased promotions and markdowns?\nKelly Dilts: Thanks, Rupesh. Yes, no, to give a little bit color on the guidance, let me walk through a couple of things. I'll tell you that, in the back half, it was primarily of obviously the softer sales trends that we saw in Q2, but also the impacts associated with those sales. So that sales mix-related margin and then the markdowns that we've been talking about. There's a lot of other puts and takes that we talked about in our prepared remarks, but those are really the primary drivers. So, to that, just to give you a little bit of color on the sales side, what I'll tell you, while we're doing all the right things to strengthen our foundation through our back to basics and the markdowns that we're looking ahead for our core customer is obviously struggling. And so, this guidance really as more of a macro neutral to a slight softening of that consumer. And so, the low end of the guidance takes that into consideration. So, we are looking at it a little-different ways than what we may have historically. I think that's important to call out as well. So, on that lower end range, we're looking at a comp similar to the comp that we had in the second quarter, whereas the higher end of the range would assume that there's some acceleration. But I think it's important to unpack that a little bit. In analyzing where we're heading in the second half, the one- and two-year trends have a lot of noise in them just given the volatility that we had last year and then the recent step change that we had in the middle of the second quarter. So, if you take a step back, we think really looking at the CAGR from 2019 is probably a more relevant view. And that's for a couple of reasons. One is, it's a similar holiday schedule to 2024, which is important. It eliminates that noise of the pandemic and the stimulus as well as inflation as we've seen inflation steady a little bit this year. So, we're really using that kind of as a basis of what we're looking for. So, with that, on the high end of our '24 guide, what we're assuming now is that a stable CAGR rate to 2019 very close to what it was in Q2. So just continue kind of where we are and that the consumer and the environment don't necessarily get much worse from here. And then on the low-end side of things, it provides for some further softening on our core customers' ability to spend. And so that's how we're thinking about the potential outcomes of what we're seeing today.\nTodd Vasos: Rupesh, on the other part of the question, as Kelly indicated, we started to see that softening. It was really evident in the month of July. And so, with that being the last period of the quarter, we really started to ramp up our promotional cadence middle of that month, as you would imagine. It takes a little time to get moving, but not as long as it used to because we used our digital tools, which we've done a very nice job over the last many years in enhancing those. And so, we were able to go out fairly quickly with some promotional activity, which now has ramped up even further as we moved into August and will continue to ramp up as we move into the third -- end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year. And I would tell you, just like we anticipated, we're seeing the response from the consumer. It was almost immediate. She continues to engage, especially with those digital tools. And I would tell you that we're really good at doing this. We've done it many times. We always said we reserve the right to invest in price, and, for us because of our great everyday low price and continue to be in a very great shape there, it's really that promotional lever that that we reserve the right. And so, we know exactly what the consumer wants and needs. We talk to her each and every quarter, and that's exactly what we're offering her right now, and we'll continue to do so. So, we believe that those promotional cadences will continue to garner more and more customers and more and more transactions as we move through this quarter and into next.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Keith: Todd, in the past, you've always talked about how in tough times your customers need you even more, and certainly, this is a tough time with inflation and your core customers are suffering a bit. How come you don't think you're seeing the normal share gains or spending behavior from your customers like you have in the past?\nTodd Vasos: That's a great question, Peter. I would tell you a couple of things that we're noticing. First of all, what we normally say, right, is that during any step change, which we saw in Q2, to Kelly's point toward the end of Q2, especially, it takes her a few quarters to come out of that, meaning our core customer. What we also see is it takes a quarter or more for the trade-in to come in at a higher rate. Now in saying that what we've noticed is the trade-in has been slower to come in to the channel than what we had anticipated and/or have seen in the past. I believe that's -- there's a couple of reasons why. I think the main reason, and I believe this is true because it appears in every piece of data that we have is that the job market is still pretty decent, right? It's not as robust as it was, but also unemployment hasn't spiked greatly, if you will, in the last quarter or so. Normally, it takes that jolt to get the trade-in to come in at a heavier clip, if you will. Now the middle and the upper middle income are still looking for value. So, I don't want you to believe that they're not. But usually, to get them to trade-in at a higher rate, usually takes something a little bit more substantial than we've even seen to occur. I'm not suggesting I want to see that happen to customer, but we stand ready and willing to serve her when that happens. The other thing that we've noticed is more and more online activity comes from that cohort. Our core customer continues her online journey pretty much the way she was. It's pretty static, if you will. But we've noticed that middle to upper middle continues to rely on online a little bit more. And so, as that occurs, I believe the trade-in slows a little bit on that side. So, it's incumbent upon us to take a look at how we offset that piece as well. And I would tell you on that, just stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on pricing just given the price investments and the comments about the promotional environment being worse than expected. Can you talk about how your competitive price gaps have evolved through this year; however, you look at that? And maybe just elaborate more on the actions that you're taking? How much of the assortment are you looking to mark down here, maybe the categories that you're focused on? And I guess just the last piece of that as we try to bridge the guidance, how much of that guidance change reflects those price investments? If I recall, last year, you had about $95 million of markdown impact. It sounds like you're saying something similar to that, so I just want to clarify, is that another $95 million?\nTodd Vasos: I'll start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. I would tell you that we feel very good about our everyday price position. As a matter of fact, we track it, and we graph it, as you would imagine, every which way. And it's fairly flat to where we've been over the last many quarters against all classes of trade. So, our everyday retails are in good shape. If you recall, when I came back in, in October last year, I did call that out as one of our shining stars that I found coming back is that our everyday low price was very competitive and continues to be even to today. So that gives us great confidence and a very good springboard to launch this promotional activity that we know exactly how to do, and we've done it many times in my time here in the last 16 years to stimulate that customer and to build a bridge the end of the month for our core customer because she's running out of money. And while I'm not going to give you the exact playbook because that wouldn't be too smart, right? But I would tell you that it will be in categories mainly that really drive that traffic for us, but more so, what that customer was looking for to bridge that time. So, if you think about things like the food categories, things like cleaning and paper where she really needs us, again, to bridge her family's gap at the end of the month, those are those areas that are best suited for this type of activity. And that's exactly how we've approached it in the past and have so far approached it, and we'll continue to approach it as we move through the back half of the year.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. No. And then just on the markdown investment as we're thinking about it in the back half. I'll tell you, it's not a certain dollar amount that we're considering. It's just overall level of promotion and markdowns that we need to take. So similar to kind of what I said before. What we're expecting is in that second half that the rate would be similar to last year. And then as we think about it more on a full year basis, what that does is get us back into kind of that markdown our promotional range that's very similar to where it was in 2019. And certainly, from a front half, back half perspective, the back half now would be heavier than the front half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Heinbockel: Two quick things. Todd, maybe how do you think about ROI of promotions? And I know a couple of years ago, you did promotions in the fourth quarter to jump start you going into the year -- the following year. And I think that lifted comps by a couple of hundred basis points. How do you think about this environment versus that? And then lastly, when I think about, right, your, -- the comp that you need to leverage expenses. I think it's still in the mid-3s. Is there an unlock -- a rolltainer-type unlock out there that can move that down materially, or we're kind of stuck with that 3% plus number?\nTodd Vasos: Yes, John, thanks for the question -- the two-part question. So, I'll take the first one, and I will tell you that, yes, for us, as we continue to look at that promotional lever, we always look at what that return would be. And at this point, we believe that it's our best use of our gross margin because, to your point, what we've seen in the past when we've done this, and you alluded to one of the times in the past, but there's been multiple times in, again, the 16 years that I've been here. And each of those times came out of that a stickier consumer, right? And so, the return is normally very much intact as we pull out of the heavier promotional activity when the time is right. Now a few years ago as well, as you know, we rationalized how we promote, and so we're a lot smarter today. So, utilizing that rationalization approach and tools that we have embedded now in our process, I believe, will help us in this activity to ensure, one, it's driving the most traffic that we can drive, but also secondly, it is the best use of our spend. Because what we want to be able to do is utilize us to lift all boats as well, meaning not only the promotional pieces, but within those areas that we are promoting, again, food, paper, cleaning, pet, those areas that I talked about earlier, that we see overall lifts in those categories. And that's what this rationalization of our markdowns in the past have provided for us. So, we've got a great book to follow there. And then as it relates to the labor side, labor rates are up a little higher than we anticipated this year. The hours that we're providing is right on what we thought. We still feel very good about the hours that are available to our stores to get the job done. But the labor rates were up a little bit more than we had anticipated coming into this year. In saying that, we are in the process right now of our rolltainer sort that you mentioned. The last time we actually did that was in 2017. And you're right, there was a small step change there in labor. I'm not suggesting that it would be as large as that by any means. But what I am suggesting is that while we feel good about the amount of labor hours we're using today, I want to continue to feel good about that. And I want our operators to continue to feel good about that. So, utilizing rolltainer store and other things that we're taking work out of the stores is not to strip more labor out of the stores, but to ensure that they have enough labor to satisfy the customer, give them the best shopping experience possible because we believe right now that is the best use of the labor hours that we have available is to further our back-to-basics work. So, stay tuned. There's always ways that we can look at the SG&A lever because it is a lot larger as you would imagine than just the labor side, while labor is a big component of it. So, stay tuned. We've got other things that we're working on that we believe can help modify a little bit of that expense as we move through the back half of the year and into next year.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nCorey Tarlowe: I just wanted to ask on inventory. Inventories are down, yet in-stock levels are up, and seemingly markdown should also be increasing, so unit velocity should increase. So, I'm curious how you think about that dynamic? And then secondarily, consumable sales have continued to increase, but seasonal sales were only down slightly close to flat. I'm curious if you saw anything to call out in that category as well?\nTodd Vasos: So why don't I start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. Yes. So let me take the second part of that question. As we exited Q2, while we weren't happy with either side of consumables or our non-consumable business, but to your point, what we saw was a flattish non-consumable business quarter-over-quarter, but a deceleration of the consumable side of the business. And what that really showed was once again that core consumer is very, very price sensitive at this point and looking for value anywhere she can find it. That's another reason why we're stepping up that promotional activity to reengage even further that consumable side of the business, which we believe, and we've already have started this venture at the end of Q2 and now into Q3, we very much believe and are seeing that engagement start to come back in. So, as we continue to ensure that we're there for the consumer, I believe that transition into a little bit more of a promotional environment will continue, but will also continue to pay off for Dollar General. And then as it relates to a little bit of the inventory, before I pass it to Kelly, is I feel very good about the inventory that we're reducing versus having to restock based on sales. As you saw, we continue to reduce, at the highest level, our consumables business, and that's usually the slowest turn business as well. And the good thing, as we continue to look forward is, these goods are fresh, they're clean, and they're very sellable and, as you can see, are selling. So, it's good to see that, but I believe it's also good that we're seeing some of the reductions to make a little bit more room inside the stores for our customers to be able to enjoy that shopping experience.\nKelly Dilts: Yes. And Todd is absolutely right. So, we feel really good about the quality of our inventory. And I think, and we called it out in the prepared remarks, this team has just done a remarkable job of reducing inventory while improving in-stock that is not easy to do. So, they're really focused on optimization, and you heard us talk about some investments last year that we put in place in order to help with that. And so, we're certainly rightsizing what we're bringing into our distribution centers and then out into the stores. And we have, I would tell you that the biggest unit decrease has been in our chain, which certainly helps with efficiencies and has driven some of the progress that we've made down that football field. And now we're starting to see it in stores as well. And so that's good to see. So, I would say that this is a real bright spot in the quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining our call. I want to begin by thanking our team for their continued dedication to serving our customers while executing our back-to-basics plan across the organization. This dedication was on full display at our leadership meeting earlier this month as we had the opportunity to host more than 1,500 leaders of our organization here at Nashville. This event served as a powerful reminder of the passion and talent of this team and the mission of serving others that unites us. On today's call, I will begin by recapping our Q2 performance, I will then share updates on our back-to-basics work as well as an update on our plans for the remainder of 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q2 financial performance as well as our updated financial outlook for the full year. Turning to our second quarter performance. We continue to make important progress on our back-to-basics plan. However, we are not satisfied with our overall financial results. On the top line, net sales increased 4.2% and to $10.2 billion in Q2 compared to net sales of $9.8 billion in last year's second quarter. Importantly, despite a weaker sales environment for our core customer than we had anticipated, we continue to grow market share in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales. Same-store sales increased 0.5% during the quarter, which was below our expectations. The increase was driven by a 1% growth in customer traffic and was partially offset by a 0.5-point decline in average transaction amount, which was driven by lower average unit retail price per item. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by the growth in our consumable category, as customers continue to focus their spending on the items, they need at most for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in our seasonal home and apparel categories. From a monthly cadence perspective, same-store sales growth was strongest in June before turning negative in July. Notably, the three softest comp sales weeks of the quarter were the last week of each of the calendar months. This pattern suggests that our customers are less able to stretch their budgets through the end of the month. With that in mind, as well as our continued softness in discretionary sales in our own customer data and survey work, we believe the softer-than-anticipated sales performance in Q2 is at least partially attributable to a core customer that is less confident of their financial position. I want to provide some additional context around what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. The majority of them state that they feel worse off financially than they were six months ago as higher prices, softer employment levels and increased borrowing costs have negatively impacted low-income consumer sentiment. As a result, our core customer who contributes approximately 60% of our overall sales comes predominantly from households earning less than $35,000 annually. Inflation has continued to negatively impact these households with more than 60% claiming they have had to sacrifice on purchasing basic necessities due to the higher cost of those items, in addition to paying more for expenses such as rent, utilities and health care. More of our customers report that they are now resorting to using credit cards for basic household needs and approximately 30% have at least one credit card that has reached its limit. And in our latest survey, 25% of our customers surveyed noted they anticipated missing a bill payment in the next six months. While middle- and higher-income households are seeking value as well, they don't claim to feel the same level of pressure as low-income households. As customers have felt more pressure on their spending, we have also seen corresponding elevation in the promotional environment beyond what we had anticipated coming into the year. Importantly, we continue to feel very good about our everyday low-price position relative to competitors and other classes of trade. However, the increased promotional activity has pressured both sales and gross margin, and we anticipate this will likely continue for the duration of the year. That said, we remain committed to our back-to-basics strategy, which focuses on controlling the things that we can control, including a timely and accurate supply chain, in-store execution and customer-centric merchandising. With this in mind, we have already begun taking decisive action to respond and strengthen our position over the back half of the year. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on our back-to-basics progress, which is foundational to our future. And then I will discuss the actions we are taking to build on that progress and deliver a stronger customer experience. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customer. Our efforts in the stores have centered around further enhancing the customer experience to deliver the value and convenience they expect in a clean and friendly shopping environment. We have increased the employee presence at the front end of our stores, with our associates committed to providing friendly, welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers while also facilitating the positive checkout experience. We have also focused labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores in an effort to significantly improve our in-stock levels and support our sales growth. These efforts have paid dividends as we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our in-stock levels. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have also contributed to the in-store progress by helping to simplify operations for our teams, which should enhance both the associate and customer experience in our stores. All of these improvements have continued to drive lower year-over-year turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager and sales associates. We are proud of the progress in the stores, and pleased to see our actions continue to resonate with our team in the field as well as with our customers. And we are working hard to continue to advance our progress and further elevate the experience within our stores. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on-time and in-full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our focused efforts here have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year, and we are pleased with what we have seen both in our traditional and fresh supply chains. We have also made good progress in optimizing our distribution capacity. As a reminder, we had previously announced plans to close 12 temporary facilities by the end of the year. We have already exited 11 of these buildings, and now believe we can close at least two more by the end of this year. While closing the less efficient temporary facilities, we have built and opened two new permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado. We expect both to ramp up operations in the coming months and to ultimately contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation costs over time. Finally, we are undertaking the first full-scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. As a reminder, the ultimate goal of this effort is to enable our store teams to stock shelves more quickly, which should drive greater on-shelf availability for our customers and ultimately support ongoing sales growth. We have made significant progress on this front, and as planned, we are on pace to complete this work by the end of the year. Overall, we remain focused on enhancing the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while keeping costs low, driving greater efficiencies and further improving the experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to the basics of merchandising. Providing a meaningful value to our customer continues to be a top priority. We have a multifaceted approach to deliver that value, including a strong everyday low price on national and private brands, compelling promotions on sales events and low opening price points, including approximately 2,000 items at or below $1 every day. We have also continued to make strong progress reducing total inventory this year, which Kelly will discuss in more detail in a moment. In 2024, we began working toward a net reduction of approximately 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of the year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. Finally, our merchants have done a fantastic job working with our operators to reduce activity and simplify work inside the stores. For example, we have reduced the number of floor stands by approximately 25% through the first half of the year, and we anticipate removing more than 50% by the end of the year. Additionally, we have reduced the number of times we rotate some of our displays, allowing our store teams to spend more time engaging with our customers. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time within our stores for our teams and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. Overall, we are making nice progress as you have heard, and we are executing on the goals we have set for our team. And importantly, we believe we will continue advancing these efforts as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we believe our back-to-basic actions will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including on-shelf availability and convenience, further enhance the associate experience in stores, including improved employee engagement and retention, and ultimately drive improvements in financial results in 2025 and beyond. However, as I previously mentioned, we are not happy with our Q2 financial results. We know the retail landscape has continued to evolve in terms of the promotional environment and financial constraints felt by our customers, and we are taking immediate action to respond to serve them, while also positioning the business for growth and value creation. With all of that in mind, we are increasing our investment in markdown activity in an effort to support our customers, further drive customer traffic and improve sales. We are investing from a strong everyday price position to further support our customer and maintain a favorable competitive positioning. We believe this investment will work in conjunction with our back-to-basic efforts to further enhance our value and convenience proposition. In summary, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with the operational progress we're making, and feel good about the actions we are taking to build on that momentum. We need to be at our best for our customers in times like this, and we are excited about the opportunity to serve them. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional value, and we have seen that when we do so consistently, we build strong brand loyalty that contributes to healthy share gains over the long term. And with store locations within 5 miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population, we are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities with value and convenience. I am confident this team will continue to rise to the occasion and seize the opportunities in front of us to further enhance the way we serve our customers, improve our financial results and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kelly. Thank you, Kelly. As we wrap up, let me say again that 2024 is about executing on our foundational back-to-basics plan, and we are pleased to be on schedule and making great progress against the goals we have previously outlined. We are confident that the actions we are taking will strengthen our foundation for the long term. This team is energized and laser-focused on our strategy to restore operational excellence while delivering value for our customers and shareholders alike. I want to close by thanking our more than 193,000 employees for their commitment to fulfilling our mission of serving others. It is a privilege to serve alongside them each and every day, and we are looking forward to all we can accomplish together in the back half of the year. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Thank you, Michael, and I appreciate the question. Yes, I fundamentally -- we fundamentally don't believe at all that the model is structurally challenged. But there are challenges to the business as this quarter indicated. Let me first start by saying that our new store productivity as well as our strong returns in new stores continue to serve us well. We continue to gain market share with these new store openings. And cannibalization with these new stores continue to be very much in line to where it's been historically. So, we don't believe that by slowing down to any large degree new stores would be the answer here. What we do believe is that this quarter, in particular, with a 0.5 point of comp versus last quarters of a fairly strong 2.4% comp, as I look at what transpired here, I would tell you that it appears to us very strongly that, one, this lower end consumer continues to be very much financially strapped especially as it relates to her ability to feed our families and support her families. As I look at our results throughout the quarter, I would tell you that, from our perspective, the last week of the calendar month of each of the calendar months was the weakest by far. When you couple that with private brand being as strong as it is for us, our value, value, which, as you probably recall, Michael, is our $1 or below offering inside of our store, which by the way, still 2,000 items, we've never walked away from that $1 price point. It is, by far, the strongest planogram that we have out there. And I would tell you that all those points would indicate that this is a cash strapped consumer right now, even more so than what we saw in Q1. Now what we also saw was that while we're not losing share, we're actually gaining share against all classes of trade in the consumable realm, what we did see in the quarter, which was different than last quarter, is the available share to take, if you will, out there from other cohorts. We didn't get our fair share of that. Now we didn't lose, right? We're not seeing any one competitor, mass or anywhere else, take our core customer. But what we did see was, at least in this quarter, the mass channel, especially those that are down south actually did a lot better in gaining the share that was available in the marketplace. We didn't get our fair share of that. So, what are we going to do about it? Well, it's exactly what we talked about in our prepared remarks. We go on the offense, and we've done that very successfully here over the years, Michael, as a merchant. And now as the CEO of this company, we know how to do this. And we're ratcheting that up as we speak. We believe that the share that's available out there, we have every right to get more than our fair share of that out there. So, we're working that really hard, and you heard that in our prepared remarks. So, I'd say that this box, this company and the small box in general is very much alive and well. We're just going through a little bit of a transition period and a transformation, as you know. And it's never usually a straight line to the top when you do these, right? And so, a few bumps in the road, but we feel that we know exactly how we can go about garnering that share that's available out there. And Kelly, you may want to take the second part. Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. And as we continue to move through this transformation period, obviously, as we said, it's never a straight line to the top. There's bumps in the road. The margin is one of those. As we've indicated right from the start, the biggest opportunity we have in the margin that's a differentiator than just a few years ago is in that shrink area. We believe we've got ample opportunity there to get our shrink back in line. As Kelly indicated in her prepared remarks, we're starting to see some benefit from all the work that we've done around that. And we still very much believe that it will turn to a tailwind as we move into Q4 and then much more substantial of a tailwind into '25. Now shrink is a constant battle, it's work every day, but it's that pick and showable work that we know how to do, and we know how to do very well here at Dollar General. The other thing I do want to point out, Simeon, is that, as we continue to move, I would tell you our back-to-basics plan has started to really show some signs of life here. And when I say that, when I look at our operations, as an example, we've been using a football analogy for the last few quarters. And I would tell you that we, across the 50-yard line last quarter in Q1, I would tell you, we're around the opponents 40-yard line at this point, which is good to see. We're making progress. We're making progress in a lot of fronts there, one being our staffing at the front ends, the reduction takeaway of the self-checkouts and moving those to assisted lanes, it was in full swing. Our customers are telling us they like it a lot more. Not surprising. They like the interaction instead of having to check out themselves. And we like what we see on that front. And I believe that's what's starting to show up on our shrink results as well in a positive manner. The other thing that we're working hard on, we're starting to see that shrink traction, as I talked about. We're also starting to see in-stocks better each and every quarter, really each and every period as we continue to move through. So, in-stocks are getting better. Our turnover inside of our stores at all levels of our operating group is getting better from our Regional Director, DM, Store Manager right down to the sales associates inside of our stores, which is usually a true testament that we're doing the right things for our employees, which in turn is normally the right thing for our customers. So, we believe that those are all green light. On our merchandising side, I'm very proud of the inventory reductions that took place on a same-store basis, especially 11% down in total inventory on a same-store basis, 16% down on a same-store basis in non-con and 7.6% decrease per store on a per store basis in consumables, all while driving greater share gains through our consumable categories. Where we're working hard is to continue to engage that consumer now through this promotional lever. We have a very strong everyday price out there. This will just lever on top of that. This will just lever on top of that. The other thing that I do want to talk about as well is that we've reduced -- in the process of reducing the 1,000 SKUs. That continues to do very well. We're well on track and we'll hit our goal by the end of this fiscal year in reducing the 1,000 core SKUs. And we're evaluating what that may look like in '25 for additional opportunities to continue to reduce that inventory level and simplify work at the store level. Off-shelf displays are down by 25%, as you heard in our prepared remarks in the first half, going to be down over 50% in the back half. And of course, all the work simplification that we've done, I think, is going to be very important. And lastly, our supply chain continues to really do well. When I think about where we are in the football field, we are down around the 30-yard line at this point, getting ready to get into the red zone here. And that is a true testament to the hard work of our supply chain, but also a cross-functional work of our operators and our merchants. Our on-time and in-full rates are exceeding our expectations into this coming quarter. And right now, what we're working on hard is making sure that we are consistent, right? Because consistency here is going to be the key. If I can deliver on time to our stores consistently, it gives them a full leg up and be able to work that seven-day workflow that we know, when executed at the store level, is a real positive for our stores in serving the customer each and every day. So, a lot of great things are going on. Yes, a little pressure on certain lines. We believe that our guidance is very prudent based on where that consumer is right now, and our transformation progress as well as where we want to make sure that we continue to drive that traffic. Very nice to see a positive 1% traffic gain still for the quarter. We're not happy with just the 1%, we're going to drive for more. But we know how to do this, Simeon. We've done it. We've proven that once we continue to back that consumer through tough times, she is there when the better times come and she is very sticky. And that's exactly how we're approaching it this time around. Yes. I don't want to talk too much about August, but I would tell you that what we've seen in -- so far in this quarter is in our guidance and feel that we're on track there. So very much I believe in that guidance that we put out there. Now I would tell you that while we're happy with the 1% that we gained on traffic. We believe there's more to gain there. And as I indicated in my first question answer there, I would tell you, Matt, that what we saw is the guys down in Bentonville are doing a pretty nice job in garnering the available traffic that's out there from other retailers. We haven't seen a deterioration on our side. But what we saw in Q1 was a greater pickup from the available share maybe from other classes of trade, grocery and drug. While we got some of it, we didn't get our fair share, at least what I would consider to be our fair share. And that's why we're attacking this and going on the offense. We believe that as we continue to be there for our customer in this regard will help us gain momentum into the back half of the year and hopefully a springboard into 2025. And Kelly, you may want to elaborate a little bit on the other side. Rupesh, on the other part of the question, as Kelly indicated, we started to see that softening. It was really evident in the month of July. And so, with that being the last period of the quarter, we really started to ramp up our promotional cadence middle of that month, as you would imagine. It takes a little time to get moving, but not as long as it used to because we used our digital tools, which we've done a very nice job over the last many years in enhancing those. And so, we were able to go out fairly quickly with some promotional activity, which now has ramped up even further as we moved into August and will continue to ramp up as we move into the third -- end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year. And I would tell you, just like we anticipated, we're seeing the response from the consumer. It was almost immediate. She continues to engage, especially with those digital tools. And I would tell you that we're really good at doing this. We've done it many times. We always said we reserve the right to invest in price, and, for us because of our great everyday low price and continue to be in a very great shape there, it's really that promotional lever that that we reserve the right. And so, we know exactly what the consumer wants and needs. We talk to her each and every quarter, and that's exactly what we're offering her right now, and we'll continue to do so. So, we believe that those promotional cadences will continue to garner more and more customers and more and more transactions as we move through this quarter and into next. That's a great question, Peter. I would tell you a couple of things that we're noticing. First of all, what we normally say, right, is that during any step change, which we saw in Q2, to Kelly's point toward the end of Q2, especially, it takes her a few quarters to come out of that, meaning our core customer. What we also see is it takes a quarter or more for the trade-in to come in at a higher rate. Now in saying that what we've noticed is the trade-in has been slower to come in to the channel than what we had anticipated and/or have seen in the past. I believe that's -- there's a couple of reasons why. I think the main reason, and I believe this is true because it appears in every piece of data that we have is that the job market is still pretty decent, right? It's not as robust as it was, but also unemployment hasn't spiked greatly, if you will, in the last quarter or so. Normally, it takes that jolt to get the trade-in to come in at a heavier clip, if you will. Now the middle and the upper middle income are still looking for value. So, I don't want you to believe that they're not. But usually, to get them to trade-in at a higher rate, usually takes something a little bit more substantial than we've even seen to occur. I'm not suggesting I want to see that happen to customer, but we stand ready and willing to serve her when that happens. The other thing that we've noticed is more and more online activity comes from that cohort. Our core customer continues her online journey pretty much the way she was. It's pretty static, if you will. But we've noticed that middle to upper middle continues to rely on online a little bit more. And so, as that occurs, I believe the trade-in slows a little bit on that side. So, it's incumbent upon us to take a look at how we offset that piece as well. And I would tell you on that, just stay tuned. I'll start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. I would tell you that we feel very good about our everyday price position. As a matter of fact, we track it, and we graph it, as you would imagine, every which way. And it's fairly flat to where we've been over the last many quarters against all classes of trade. So, our everyday retails are in good shape. If you recall, when I came back in, in October last year, I did call that out as one of our shining stars that I found coming back is that our everyday low price was very competitive and continues to be even to today. So that gives us great confidence and a very good springboard to launch this promotional activity that we know exactly how to do, and we've done it many times in my time here in the last 16 years to stimulate that customer and to build a bridge the end of the month for our core customer because she's running out of money. And while I'm not going to give you the exact playbook because that wouldn't be too smart, right? But I would tell you that it will be in categories mainly that really drive that traffic for us, but more so, what that customer was looking for to bridge that time. So, if you think about things like the food categories, things like cleaning and paper where she really needs us, again, to bridge her family's gap at the end of the month, those are those areas that are best suited for this type of activity. And that's exactly how we've approached it in the past and have so far approached it, and we'll continue to approach it as we move through the back half of the year. Yes, John, thanks for the question -- the two-part question. So, I'll take the first one, and I will tell you that, yes, for us, as we continue to look at that promotional lever, we always look at what that return would be. And at this point, we believe that it's our best use of our gross margin because, to your point, what we've seen in the past when we've done this, and you alluded to one of the times in the past, but there's been multiple times in, again, the 16 years that I've been here. And each of those times came out of that a stickier consumer, right? And so, the return is normally very much intact as we pull out of the heavier promotional activity when the time is right. Now a few years ago as well, as you know, we rationalized how we promote, and so we're a lot smarter today. So, utilizing that rationalization approach and tools that we have embedded now in our process, I believe, will help us in this activity to ensure, one, it's driving the most traffic that we can drive, but also secondly, it is the best use of our spend. Because what we want to be able to do is utilize us to lift all boats as well, meaning not only the promotional pieces, but within those areas that we are promoting, again, food, paper, cleaning, pet, those areas that I talked about earlier, that we see overall lifts in those categories. And that's what this rationalization of our markdowns in the past have provided for us. So, we've got a great book to follow there. And then as it relates to the labor side, labor rates are up a little higher than we anticipated this year. The hours that we're providing is right on what we thought. We still feel very good about the hours that are available to our stores to get the job done. But the labor rates were up a little bit more than we had anticipated coming into this year. In saying that, we are in the process right now of our rolltainer sort that you mentioned. The last time we actually did that was in 2017. And you're right, there was a small step change there in labor. I'm not suggesting that it would be as large as that by any means. But what I am suggesting is that while we feel good about the amount of labor hours we're using today, I want to continue to feel good about that. And I want our operators to continue to feel good about that. So, utilizing rolltainer store and other things that we're taking work out of the stores is not to strip more labor out of the stores, but to ensure that they have enough labor to satisfy the customer, give them the best shopping experience possible because we believe right now that is the best use of the labor hours that we have available is to further our back-to-basics work. So, stay tuned. There's always ways that we can look at the SG&A lever because it is a lot larger as you would imagine than just the labor side, while labor is a big component of it. So, stay tuned. We've got other things that we're working on that we believe can help modify a little bit of that expense as we move through the back half of the year and into next year. So why don't I start, Kelly, and I'll turn it over to you. Yes. So let me take the second part of that question. As we exited Q2, while we weren't happy with either side of consumables or our non-consumable business, but to your point, what we saw was a flattish non-consumable business quarter-over-quarter, but a deceleration of the consumable side of the business. And what that really showed was once again that core consumer is very, very price sensitive at this point and looking for value anywhere she can find it. That's another reason why we're stepping up that promotional activity to reengage even further that consumable side of the business, which we believe, and we've already have started this venture at the end of Q2 and now into Q3, we very much believe and are seeing that engagement start to come back in. So, as we continue to ensure that we're there for the consumer, I believe that transition into a little bit more of a promotional environment will continue, but will also continue to pay off for Dollar General. And then as it relates to a little bit of the inventory, before I pass it to Kelly, is I feel very good about the inventory that we're reducing versus having to restock based on sales. As you saw, we continue to reduce, at the highest level, our consumables business, and that's usually the slowest turn business as well. And the good thing, as we continue to look forward is, these goods are fresh, they're clean, and they're very sellable and, as you can see, are selling. So, it's good to see that, but I believe it's also good that we're seeing some of the reductions to make a little bit more room inside the stores for our customers to be able to enjoy that shopping experience."

            "name": "Kelly Dilts",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year, all references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share, and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For the second quarter, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30%, a decrease of 112 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased markdowns, increased inventory damages, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and increased shrink. These factors were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. With regards to markdowns, we are now seeing promotional levels greater than we had anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are increasingly seeking value in their purchasing behavior in addition to an overall increased promotional environment. Shrink was a year-over-year headwind of 21 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And I want to note that while shrink continues to be a significant headwind, we are pleased with the progress we're making and believe our actions, including our self-checkout conversions, are having a positive impact. Turning to SG&A. It was 24.6% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 57 basis points. The primary expenses that were greater percentage of net sales in the current year period were retail, labor, depreciation and amortization, store occupancy costs and utilities. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the second quarter decreased 20.6% to $550 million. As a percentage of sales, operating profit was 5.4%, a decrease of 168 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $68 million compared to $84 million in last year's second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3% and compares to 22.9% in the second quarter last year. This lower rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate-impacting items such as federal tax credits on lower earnings before taxes. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 20.2% to $1.70. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $7 billion at the end of second quarter, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year and a decrease of 11% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 13% compared to last year and decreased 17% on a per store basis. Importantly, we continue to believe that the quality of our inventory remains good. The team has done a nice job reducing our overall inventory position while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher in-stock levels. We will continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate balance of mix of inventory to drive sales while also mitigating shrink risk and improving our working capital. The business has generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion year-to-date, an increase of 127% as we continue to improve our working capital position, primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures for the 26-week period were $696 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Now I want to provide an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. On the top line, we've updated our guidance to reflect our second quarter results as well as our expectations that the customer will continue to feel financial pressure for the duration of the year, and the promotional environment will remain elevated beyond what we had initially anticipated. With that in mind, we now expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 4.7% to 5.3% and same-store sales growth in the range of approximately 1% to 1.6%. Turning to gross margin, we expect additional pressure as a result of the increased promotional markdown activity that Todd noted, as well as increased sales mix pressure due to the customers' need to prioritize their spending on the consumables category. With regard to damages, our guidance now assumes no improvement in the back half of the year, though we are focused on addressing this headwind through our continued emphasis on getting back to basics. And while we expect shrink to be a headwind for the full year, our results from the second quarter as well as positive trends in other metrics that are highly correlative to shrink, including inventory reductions, supporting our belief that we are moving in the right direction to continue mitigating this headwind. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see shrink begin to turn to a tailwind later in Q4 and then become a more material tailwind in 2025. Within SG&A, we are seeing an elevated rate of maintenance expense, particularly with HVAC units and coolers during the summer months. We're taking steps in the back half of the year to be more proactive in addressing these opportunities in order to provide a more consistent customer experience across our store footprint, while also supporting ongoing sales growth. As a result, we expect incremental pressure from the increased repairs and maintenance expense to continue within SG&A in the back half of the year. Finally, we are also seeing pressure from wage rate inflation closer to approximately 4% this year, which is higher than was contemplated in our initial guidance for the year. With all of this in mind, we are updating our EPS guidance and now expect to deliver EPS in the range of approximately $5.50 to $6.20. This guidance now assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. This capital spending remains aligned with our capital allocation priorities, which continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. To that end, we remain on track to deliver on our plans of approximately 2,435 real estate projects this year, including 730 new stores, 1,620 remodels, and 85 relocations. Next in our capital allocation priorities, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment, and over time and when appropriate, share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio remains above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment-grade credit ratings, which, as a reminder, are BBB and BAA2. In summary, while we're not satisfied with the financial results for the second quarter, we are pleased with the continued progress in our back-to-basics work, and we believe we're taking the necessary actions to build on this progress and drive the business forward. We remain committed to disciplined expense and capital management as a low-cost operator, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. And we continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. I want to emphasize that we're confident and excited about the long-term future of this business, including driving profitable same-store sales and deliver meaningful operating margin expansion while generating healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and creating long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. Yes, absolutely. So yes, just how do we build that margin back over time? I think it's important to call out, one, you nailed it. It's a softer sales environment. So, with the top line, that does put pressure on our fixed cost leverage, specifically labor and rent and those type of things as you well know. But as Todd talked about, I think, in the near term, one is just going on the offense and taking the markdown investment that we need to take on a go-forward basis to drive sales and to be there for our customer. And to kind of put that in context, I would say that what we're looking at in this back half is going to be markdown rate to what we saw last year in the back half as well. So more than we had anticipated, but absolutely the right decision and not necessarily one that we have to think about over the long term as that can come back in line when circumstances change. The other piece of this, and we've talked a lot about it, obviously, is shrink and mix headwinds. And so, we're certainly experiencing those. Although, I think we have a lot of good news here to report on the shrink side of things starting to see that trend bend. It just takes a while to flow that through the financial statements. And then, the damage piece of this as well is putting a little pressure on the second half. But again, all the things that we're doing on a back-to-basics efforts are going to help to mitigate that as well as just having a focused team on that. So, I think those are kind of the near-term things that we'll be dealing with that will get in line. And then over the long term, our underlying long-term drivers are still in place. We still have a long runway for new store opportunities with high returns. We have higher returns with the opportunities that we have with our existing stores. And then you saw, this period, our cash from operations was up 127%. So, we are still generating a significant amount of cash flow, which gives us the ability to invest in the business. So, we feel good about the long-term potential of getting those margins back over time. Yes. No, absolutely. So yes, taking a look at second quarter comps on a cadence basis, so June was our strongest month and then it started to turn negative in July. And so, what we really saw kind of in that mid-quarter time frame just a general step down, and it was all around the transaction side of things to Todd's point. So, when we think about what we are contemplating as we went into Q2, I would tell you that on the basket side, we were pretty much in line with our expectations. It was on the transaction side, which is what the teams are going to run hard after driving sales and making sure that we get the customers the value that they need right now. So that's really the cadence. The other thing I think that's really important to point out is the of each of the calendar months were the softest comp weeks of the quarter. And for us, that really indicates that she started to run out of money by the end of the month. And what we saw in some of our survey work is just that our core customer says that they're feeling worse off financially than they did six months ago. And so, again, it just goes back to the point of in this back half, making sure that we're playing offense on driving sales and taking the markdown investment that we need to do. Thanks, Rupesh. Yes, no, to give a little bit color on the guidance, let me walk through a couple of things. I'll tell you that, in the back half, it was primarily of obviously the softer sales trends that we saw in Q2, but also the impacts associated with those sales. So that sales mix-related margin and then the markdowns that we've been talking about. There's a lot of other puts and takes that we talked about in our prepared remarks, but those are really the primary drivers. So, to that, just to give you a little bit of color on the sales side, what I'll tell you, while we're doing all the right things to strengthen our foundation through our back to basics and the markdowns that we're looking ahead for our core customer is obviously struggling. And so, this guidance really as more of a macro neutral to a slight softening of that consumer. And so, the low end of the guidance takes that into consideration. So, we are looking at it a little-different ways than what we may have historically. I think that's important to call out as well. So, on that lower end range, we're looking at a comp similar to the comp that we had in the second quarter, whereas the higher end of the range would assume that there's some acceleration. But I think it's important to unpack that a little bit. In analyzing where we're heading in the second half, the one- and two-year trends have a lot of noise in them just given the volatility that we had last year and then the recent step change that we had in the middle of the second quarter. So, if you take a step back, we think really looking at the CAGR from 2019 is probably a more relevant view. And that's for a couple of reasons. One is, it's a similar holiday schedule to 2024, which is important. It eliminates that noise of the pandemic and the stimulus as well as inflation as we've seen inflation steady a little bit this year. So, we're really using that kind of as a basis of what we're looking for. So, with that, on the high end of our '24 guide, what we're assuming now is that a stable CAGR rate to 2019 very close to what it was in Q2. So just continue kind of where we are and that the consumer and the environment don't necessarily get much worse from here. And then on the low-end side of things, it provides for some further softening on our core customers' ability to spend. And so that's how we're thinking about the potential outcomes of what we're seeing today. Yes. No. And then just on the markdown investment as we're thinking about it in the back half. I'll tell you, it's not a certain dollar amount that we're considering. It's just overall level of promotion and markdowns that we need to take. So similar to kind of what I said before. What we're expecting is in that second half that the rate would be similar to last year. And then as we think about it more on a full year basis, what that does is get us back into kind of that markdown our promotional range that's very similar to where it was in 2019. And certainly, from a front half, back half perspective, the back half now would be heavier than the front half of the year. Yes. And Todd is absolutely right. So, we feel really good about the quality of our inventory. And I think, and we called it out in the prepared remarks, this team has just done a remarkable job of reducing inventory while improving in-stock that is not easy to do. So, they're really focused on optimization, and you heard us talk about some investments last year that we put in place in order to help with that. And so, we're certainly rightsizing what we're bringing into our distribution centers and then out into the stores. And we have, I would tell you that the biggest unit decrease has been in our chain, which certainly helps with efficiencies and has driven some of the progress that we've made down that football field. And now we're starting to see it in stores as well. And so that's good to see. So, I would say that this is a real bright spot in the quarter."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General, First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, May 30, 2024. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Walker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin, you may begin your conference.\nKevin Walker : Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos : Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining the call. We are pleased with our start of the year, and I want to recognize the great work of our entire team as they have fully embraced our plan to get back to the basics at Dollar General. On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q1 performance, as well as sharing an update on some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q1 financial performance as well as our current outlook for Q2 and the full year, and then I will wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics across the business. Turning to our first quarter performance. Net sales increased 6.1% to $9.9 billion in Q1 compared to net sales of $9.3 billion in the last year's first quarter. These results included accelerated market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales, as well as market share growth in dollars in non-consumable product sales. We opened 197 new stores during the quarter and are excited about our ability to continue to expand the number of communities we serve. Same store sales increased 2.4% during the quarter, which was above the top end of our Q1 guidance. We believe this result is a testament to the relevance of Dollar General in our communities and the ongoing positive impact of our back to basics work. The comp sales increase was driven by strong growth in consumer traffic of more than 4% and was partially offset by decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by strong growth in our consumable category by customers relied on us for the value of the items they need most often for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a cadence perspective, growth was strongest in March, including a benefit of Easter moving from April into March this year, and was relatively similar in the months of February and April. We believe the softness in sales in the discretionary category during Q1 is a reflection of the continued pressure our core customers feel on their spending. They continue to be very value oriented in their shopping behavior, which we see manifested in accelerated share growth in private brand sales, as well as increased engagement with items at or below the $1 price point. Importantly, we continue to do well with our core customers while growing with middle and higher income trade-in customers from adjacent cohorts. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade, and our value proposition presents significant opportunity for ongoing growth among a wide range of customers. Looking ahead, we expect value to continue to be the most important consideration for customers in multiple income ranges. We know that our customers need us even more when they face economic challenges, and we are well positioned to help them stretch their dollar. Before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to provide a brief update on our shrink reduction efforts, including the changes to our self-checkout strategy that we announced in March. Shrink continues to be the most significant headwind in our business, and we are deploying an end-to-end approach to shrink reduction across the organization, including efforts in our supply chain merchandising and within our stores to help combat issues around shrink. Our supply chain teams are primarily focused on ensuring deliveries are on time and in full, and our merchants on reducing the amount of inventory we carry. Within our stores, we are focusing on delivering a more consistent front end presence, broaden in the reach of our high shrink planograms, which include the removal of high shrink SKUs and the elimination of self-checkout in the vast majority of stores. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we converted approximately 9,000 stores away from self-checkout during the quarter following the quick and successful conversion of these stores in Q1, and given the ongoing challenge from shrink, we converted approximately 3,000 additional stores away from self-checkout in May, bringing us to approximately 12,000 conversions completed in total. While this represents a significant change in our stores, we believe this is the right course of action to drive increased customer engagement, while also better positioning us to begin reducing shrink in the back half of \u201824 with a more material positive impact expected in 2025. Moving forward, we plan to have self-checkout options available in a limited number of stores, most of which are higher volume and low shrink locations. Overall, we are pleased with the results and progress across the business during the first quarter, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and this team is excited about the work we are doing. We have a long history of serving customers in a variety of economic environments, thanks to our distinctive combination of value and convenience. I also want to note that we recently published our annual servings others report, which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts and goals. We recognize the great responsibility we have as an essential partner to the communities we call home and are excited about the many ways we are able to serve our customers, associates, communities, and shareholders, and with everyday low prices in store locations within five miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. We are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities across the country. We remain focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General as we look to enhance the way we serve customers, further develop and support our associates and create a long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Dilts : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2%, a decrease of 145 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, a greater consumable sales mix and lower inventory markups. These were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. Shrink continues to be our most significant headwind and with 59 basis points worse in the first quarter compared to prior year. As Todd noted, we are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink, and I'll discuss our expectation for this headwind for the remainder of the year in just a bit. With regards to markdowns, we're seeing promotional levels more similar to 2019 levels as we anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are seeking value and we saw strong take rates on promotional items during the first quarter. Turning to SG&A, it was 24.7% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 97 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, depreciation and amortization, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 26.3% to $546 million. As a percentage of sales operating profit was 5.5%, a decrease of 242 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $72 million compared to $83 million in last year's first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% and compares to 21.8% in the first quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes and expense recognition attributable to stock-based compensation. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.5% to $1.65, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of Q1, a decrease of 5.5% compared to prior year and a decrease of 9.5% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 19.1% compared to last year and decreased 22.5% on a per store basis. The team continues to do great work reducing our overall inventory position, while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher end stocks. We're pleased with the significant progress on this important goal, which not only frees up more cash in the business, but also helps to mitigate further shrink risk. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business generated cash flows from operations of $664 million during the quarter, an increase of 247% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $342 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and proud of these results, including gains in customer traffic and market share, significantly lower inventory levels, and improved cash flow from operations. Moving to our financial outlooks for fiscal 2024, while it's still early in the year, we believe our positive first quarter results reinforce the importance of our stores to the communities we serve, as well as the progress of our back to basics work. With that in mind, we're reiterating our financial guidance for 2024 and continue to expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. This guidance continues to assume an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense and an effective tax rate in a range of approximately 22.5% to 23.5%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. We continually evaluate and seek to optimize the use of this capital, and as a result we have updated our expectations for real estate projects in 2024. We now expect to remodel approximately 1,620 stores this year compared to our previous expectation of 1,500 remodels. To facilitate this increase in remodels, we're reducing the number of planned new stores to 730 compared to our previous expectation of 800 new stores. We continue to expect to relocate 85 stores. In total, this increases our expected total real estate project count from 2,385 to approximately 2,435. We're excited about this increase in projects and the expanded investment in our mature stores, and we believe this is an appropriate reallocation of our capital. As a reminder, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we believe they continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which as a reminder are BBB and Baa2. Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. Our customer continues to be very value driven and we anticipate they will continue to be price sensitive as we move through the year. With this in mind, we expect sales mix pressure to be above our original expectation, and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen and continue to expect the promotional environment reversion to pre pandemic levels as we move throughout 2024. As such, we expect our promotional markdown headwinds to gross margin will continue at least through the first half of the year. As Todd noted, shrink is currently trending worse than we initially expected coming into the year, and we now expect this headwind to be greater in 2024 than what was originally contemplated in the financial guidance we provided on our earnings call in March. We're taking aggressive and decisive action to mitigate this challenge, and we're expecting to see improvement later in the back half of 2024 than we had previously anticipated and more significantly into 2025. Turning to SG&A, our expectations are relatively unchanged from what we previously provided on our Q4 call. We continue to anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation in 2024, as well as an ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization, while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given the somewhat atypical cadence of this year and some of its specific headwinds, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the second quarter. To that end, we expect comp sales to increase in the low 2% range in the second quarter with EPS in the range of approximately $1.70 to $1.85. In summary, we're pleased with the solid start to our year, including exceeding our top and bottom-line expectations for first quarter. We believe our actions are resonating with our customers, strengthening our competitive position and reinforcing our foundation for future growth. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. We're excited about the long-term future of this business, including plans to drive profitable, same store sales and meaningful operating margin growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow, and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.\nTodd Vasos: Thank you, Kelly. Our focus continues to center on our four key operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment, and inclusion. As we have discussed to advance these priorities in the near term, we have implemented a refreshed approach to getting back to the basics to enhance store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our supply chain, stores and merchandising. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customers. As a reminder, we have prioritized increasing the employee presence at the front end of our stores to provide a friendly welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers, while also facilitating a positive checkout experience. As we have continued to move away from self-checkout in the majority of our stores, we believe this focus is even more important in serving our customers and supporting our sales growth. We have additionally focused more of our labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specified and specialized inventory training in each store. Our customers are taking note of these efforts as we have seen a significant improvement in their perception of our in-stock levels, which we believe is contributing to our growth in customer traffic, market share, and comp sales. Finally, we have also taken a significant action to make it easier to operate our stores while also enhancing the overall experience for associates and customers. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant strides in serving our stores. In addition to the work we have done in the field, such as reducing district manager\u2019s fans of control, simplifying and eliminating certain activities and reducing inventory. We continue to focus on reducing store manager turnover, which is correlated to sales and shrink results in our stores. Notably, while we still have work to do, we are seeing year over year reductions in turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager, and sales associate. We are proud of this progress and excited to see our actions resonating with our team in the field. Overall, we believe the actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on shelf availability and convenience. Enhance the associate experience in the stores including improved employee engagement and retention, and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on time and in full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams have taken aggressive action to improve their service to our stores, and these efforts have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year. When we began our back to basics work last year, we identified an opportunity to exit 12 temporary warehouse facilities, which would lower cost and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Since that time, we have exited seven of these buildings and are in and on track to exit the remainder in 2024. In conjunction with these moves, we are making great progress on our permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado, both of which are scheduled to open later this year, and which should contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation cost over time. Finally, we have also begun the first full scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers, since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. Work has begun on all 18 of our dry facilities with four already completed. We are making quick progress on the others and believe we will finish this work by the end of the year. Once we conclude the resort process, we believe our store teams will be able to restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on shelf availability for our customers and increase sales. Ultimately, we believe these actions will enhance the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while driving greater efficiencies and a further improved experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to basics and merchandising. Our team's top priority is always delivering value to the customer, and we continue to innovate on ways to provide the products they want and need at affordable prices. These basics are important to our customer, which is why we remain committed to a strong private brand offering affordable national brands and the $1 price point. Despite the inflationary pressures we have experienced over the last year, we continue to carry approximately 2000 items at or below the $1 price point in the majority of our stores as we help our customers stretch their dollar in our stores each and every day. As Kelly noted, we also continue to focus on meaningfully reducing our inventory position, and the team has done an outstanding job on this front over the past six months. In 2024, we committed to a net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of this year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. We have already made good progress selling through the remaining inventory and resetting planograms to remove these items from our stores. Importantly, we expect a significant portion of the sales of these secondary and tertiary SKUs will transfer to primary SKUs that will remain in our offering. Finally, our merchants have been working with our operators to identify and execute on simplification opportunities such as reducing the number of floor stands and monthly end cap resets to reduce activities for our store teams. In conjunction with the work of our supply chain teams to optimize the sorting process. Our merchants are also working to increase the number of products that can go straight to the shelf, eliminating the need for extra touches within the store. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time in our stores for our teams, and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. As we wrap up this morning, I want to say again, how proud I am of the team's great work and commitment to getting back to basics as we fulfill our mission of serving others. We are moving with great urgency to implement our back to basics plan and execute on the things that matter most to our customers. And while we are pleased with the positive results, stemming from many of these actions, we recognize that some of our efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit, and we'll continue to work to capitalize on these opportunities. I want to thank our more than 186,000 employees for their ongoing engagement and their passion for our customer. This team is energized and confident in our strategy, both near term to restore operational excellence and long term to deliver value for our customers and shareholders alike. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together throughout 2024. With that operator, we will now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS.\nMichael Lasser : It's a multi-part question. First, why is shrink worse than you expected? And how have you been able to offset that while still being able to maintain your full year EPS guidance? And similarly, you mentioned that the promotional environment has gotten more intense. That's not surprising. Given all the announcements from competitors who've talked about price investments, what risk does that create to your margins in the second half of the year as you might have to respond to what's happening in the marketplace?\nTodd Vasos: On shrink, I just want to make sure we referenced back to last quarter as we rolled out our back to basics program in earnest over the last few months. We talked about last quarter that some areas will take a little longer to manifest itself in a real positive manner. We called out shrink as being one of those because shrink has the longest tail to it. And quite frankly, we have many levers on shrink that we watch. And we look at each and every quarter. In saying that, the great thing here is that what we're seeing on the shrink front right now is what we thought we would. And that is of the shrink indicators that we watch. And by the way, we use a proprietary predictive model to look at this. We've had this for many years and as you know, over the years, our shrink indicators will would have indicated and have performed in a pretty good manner up until recently. And these predictive models are now flashing green or positive with the majority of the items that we look at for shrink. So in saying that, in a nutshell, we feel pretty good about what that would indicate for the back half of the year, and what that will indicate hopefully for \u201825 and beyond, just like we thought it would. It would come together a little softer in Q1, but again, green shoots, which is really great to see starting to perform. And Kelly, you may want to just mention how it affects the margin overall.\nKelly Dilts : No, absolutely. So it takes a little while for some of that improvement to show up in our financial results, which is why we're calling it out. So we do expect to see improvement in the second half of the year and even more meaningfully into 2025 as we work through that. I think your other question was just what are we doing to work to offset any of those risks? And I'll tell you, we have a lot underway as we typically do, where our goal is always to improve margins. And so, some of the underlying drivers that we still have in place as we work through the shrink piece include DG Media network. So, looking for some meaningful contribution there. We still have private brands which generate better margins than some of the national brands, and it's certainly something that our consumer is looking for now. We have got global sourcing category management, which is just huge here at Dollar General. And certainly, a way to offset any of the risks that we see in the near term. And then of course, inventory optimization, which the team has done just a fantastic job of focusing on and finally supply chain efficiencies. Certainly, we are continuing to look for those efficiencies as we move through this year and frankly as we move through each and every year. So I think with all of those underlying drivers and just delivering on our back to basics actions on driving sales and lowering shrink, we feel good that we're strengthening that foundation for the long term and into the back half of the year.\nTodd Vasos : And then Michael, I know you had a second part question and as it relates to the promotional activity and what we're seeing from that, as you may recall, we were probably one of the first ones to call out that we believe that the promotional environment would rise in 2024. We made mention that we believe it's going to be more reminiscent to free COVID times, so 2019 type levels, and quite frankly, in Q1, that's exactly what we saw. And we still see it, the same way, today as we move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. So, it's pretty much right on what we thought. And I would tell you that for us, here at Dollar General, we've always done a very good job, as of balancing that everyday value here on the shelf meeting our everyday price, and then seeding in that promotional activity to really show even more value to the consumer. We do that probably as good as anyone. And the great thing about Dollar General is that category management that Kelly just mentioned where we are a large player with almost every CPG company in America. And with that, allows us the opportunity to continue to work with them very closely to help mitigate margin risks from that promotional activity. So we feel good. Everything is contemplated in our guidance, as we move forward. And we feel good about that promotional activity to show good value to the consumer. And it's been resonating. Take a look at our sales for the quarter and our transactions for the quarter. I think the balance is being struck very well here.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss : So Todd, maybe could you elaborate on customer behaviors that you saw as the first quarter progressed as we think about consumables relative to discretionary maybe what comp trend have you seen so far in May relative to your load two second quarter guidance? And then just larger picture, where does the back to basics strategy stand today relative to the overall opportunity? Thinking about near term opportunities, and then as you said, things that just may take a little bit longer.\nTodd Vasos : Matt, what we're seeing from the consumer overall is what we pretty well called out in March, and that is, it's a cautious consumer, I think is the best way to put it. She has definitely flea the value, especially in the lower income stratas. But what we're seeing, like we saw in Q4 what we're seeing is that the next cohort and the one above that, so let's call it middle to upper middle income, and then in some of the upper income stratas, we're seeing the trade down still come in. So we feel good that we're getting new customers in. We can see it in our data, and that we're retaining at a high level those core customers of ours in that lower income strata. She is definitely making trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. And feeding her family and taking care of her family is her number one priority. Inflation has and continues to be top of mind for her. While she does say in our recent work, as you know, we go out each quarter and talk to the consumer. In our recent work, she does indicate, overall year over year, the inflation has slowed down, but what she keeps pointing out is that the inflation that has happened to her over the last couple years is still there. It hasn't gone away. So it's in the base, if you will. And as we had pointed out a couple quarters ago, we don't believe that that is probably going to dissipate as we continue to move forward. So our core consumer is still continuing to figure out her overall spending rates. Now, the great thing and as your second question asked was that consumable versus non-consumable mix. And what we saw in Q1 is in those times when the consumer wants to spend more, let's talk about Easter for a moment. We saw Easter was very good for us both on the consumable and the non-consumable side of that discretionary side of the equation. So, she has the ability to spend some, but she's very deliberate with that spend. And so we need to continue to show her value even in the discretionary areas. So what that signals to us is that she continues to figure out her income levels because she is spending on some of that discretionary. So we'll continue to foster that as we move through Q2 and beyond. And we believe it's fully contemplated in our low twos guidance that we gave in Q2. And then lastly, on our back to basics work. Thanks for asking that because we're proud of what we've done so far. If you recall, we talked about starting at about our own 20 yard line. If I can revert back to my football analogy for a moment, I would tell you that we're at or just crossing the 50 yard line now as we exited Q1, that's quite a move very quickly, I would tell you, and you asked a few of the components are moving even quicker. So I would tell you in our supply chain, very happy with what we're seeing there. Has moved well past the 50 and probably more on the 40 yard line on the other side of the field. So feeling very good about that. Our on time and in full rates have been very stable and top-notch for many weeks now. And that stability is really the key. If you remember me saying that last time, that consistency is where the stores start to feel it and the customers feel it the most. And we're starting to see that, materialize and have been for the last few weeks. As it relates to our merchandising side, I would tell you we're squarely across the 50 as well with some of our biggest components yet to come in Q2 and in the into early Q3, all the pipe has been laid for that. And we are already starting to see some of that benefit as we worked in the Q2 here. And then our operations inside of our stores and our field. I'm very proud of what they've done so far, because everything we've done back of house is now starting to manifest itself at store level. And so, I would tell you that we're squarely on the 50 yard line there as well. And I know that the team is squarely focused on moving the ball down the field in Q2 there. And I believe that, with the back of the house indicators that we see right now, I believe that that's going to happen as we move forward. Shrink is still, as we indicated probably the laggard there. We knew it would be the laggard. This is not a surprise. A little worse than we thought in Q1, but overall, not a surprise that it's going to tail everything else. But again, those green shoots I mentioned earlier really give us the confidence to reiterate our guidance for full year, because we're starting to see some of that occur. And of course, those positive sales and transactions, I don't want to minimize that. You have to take a look at that and be very positive, because the consumer is seeing the difference inside of our stores. A big difference in turn over the last couple quarters. So stay tuned. We feel pretty good. You could probably tell by my enthusiasm and the voice that we're seeing some real positives from all the work that we're doing Matt.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane : The change in the real estate plan. Just wondering if you could talk through why you're changing it at this point in time and longer term. Is this something maybe we should expect in terms of breakdown for real estate priorities between refreshes remodels and new store growth?\nKelly Dilts : Yes, thanks for the question, Kate. And just to level set everyone. So we are reducing the number of new stores this year. It's by about 70 stores, and what we're going do is move them into 2025. So we feel really good about the locations that we have identified. We're just pushing them out into to 2025. And what that does is free up capital in order to increase the number of remodels and the total real estate project count that we have. So I have to tell you, we're really excited about this increase in projects with the expanded investment particularly in our mature stores. And we think this is absolutely the appropriate reallocation of capital, especially with our back-to-basics work. And so, stay tuned for 2025, but for right now, we feel really good about this reallocation.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman : My question is on longer term margins and Todd, we've talked about getting back north of seven over time. You've gotten now six months of reflecting on the business and there's some things that are there, puts and takes at the margin, maybe some things that are a little bit worse on margin shrink and promos. Do you think that level, now that you have six months of seeing how the business and the environment looks, those levels of margin are appropriate given what you are reinvesting? And then maybe a slightly different second part of the question. The consumers that you mentioned are buying more in promotion. How does that foot now with retailers actually investing in price? I'm sure you're watching it closely, but how do you think about that in the need to not just promote, but actually make structural and price investments?\nTodd Vasos : Let me actually answer the second one first and I'll turn it over to Kelly for your first question. Again, the promotional environment is nearly exactly what we thought it would be. A little higher in Q1, but I would tell you that we knew this is the way the consumer was going to react. And we knew, and we said this in Q4, the way CPG would react because they're looking to move units as well. So, I would tell you that, this is probably both a CPG and a customer push into some of this promotional activity. Now, in saying that we feel great about our everyday price, as I indicated on the prepared remarks, we are right in line with everyday price against all classes of trade. We feel good about that. We continually invest in price and imp, impress and value at the shelf. And then the other thing to keep in mind is our expansive and growing private brand business has been very stable and solid, and growing quite frankly in Q1. And that important and magic $1 price point continues to be one of our best performers in the quarter. So we're showing value at all different spots for the consumer. And it's resonating. I mean, when you look at that transaction growth across Q1, I think, one would say it's resonating heavily with the consumer at this point. So we feel good about all of our pricing across the board, but we continue to watch it. We'll continue to watch all classes of trade. We will make adjustments if need be as we move through Q2 and beyond. But right now, the customer is reacting exactly like we thought she would, we know how to do this. We've been doing this for a long time and this category management team that we have here built in 2008 continues to be strong and continues to be working all the levers that we know how to do here at Dollar General.\nKelly Dilts : And just if -- as taking a look at the longer term and we talked about this just a minute ago, we're certainly doing everything with our back to basics actions to strengthen that foundation for longer term growth with driving sales and working on lowering shrink. We still feel great about the fundamentals of this business. We're growing share, we're growing traffic. We had good healthy comps. We're generating a lot of cash, so the model is absolutely intact. As we look forward, we still have a nice long way -- long runway for growth, and that that's new stores and our remodel program. So feel good about that. We feel good about generating a significant amount of cash flow and the investments that we're making in our business now as we look forward to how that will return in the future. And then of course, soon as we reach the target of our debt leverage, we'll be returning cash back to shareholders when appropriate on in the form of share repurchases. And so, given all of that, I would say that where we're at right now from an operating margin perspective, we know we have a lot of opportunity and we are always looking to improve our operating margin. You heard me talk about a lot of the longer-term levers that we have and some in the shorter term around the gross margin side of things, but we also have our save to serve approach to controlling costs, which is also a huge benefit to drive operating margin as well. So we certainly feel like we can do that from here. And I would tell you that we believe this business is going to return to a 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the longer term.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citi.\nPaul Lejuez : Can you talk about the comps that you assume in the non-consumable categories for the rest of the year and how those assumptions have changed? I think you said the business mix is a little bit worse of a drag than you thought. I thought you said the same for shrink and also maybe for promos. So just curious what the offsets are there as well to help keep your guidance. Thanks.\nTodd Vasos : Yes, I would tell you that our non-consumer discretionary business, as I mentioned earlier, it's still alive and well. It's just the consumer is making those trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. But I would tell you again, during those important times when discretionary is important to her family, she has the ability to spend. So that shows you that and gives us confidence that we have the right products for the consumer at the right value and price. And as we continue to move through Q2 and beyond, we believe layering in some promotional activity and discretionary, like we are in our core non-consumable areas, excuse me, was -- is probably the right thing to do. So we believe a nice balance of both will help the consumer stay engaged in the discretionary side of the business. I have seen, looked at seen and are am very pleased with the holiday lineup we've got coming up. I know it's a little premature, but it never is when we start talking about holiday because it has such a long lead time coming in. And the lineup we have this year is very strong for the back half of the year as well. So more to come. I believe we've got all the right building blocks in place for the discretionary side of the business to continue to get healthier and healthier as we move through the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh : So just going back to the commenter on the failure guidance, so it implies a pretty strong second half profit recovery. So I just want to get a sense of the confidence and driving the acceleration in the key drivers as you guys look out to the back half of the year.\nKelly Dilts : Yes, thanks Rupesh. I would say we are certainly pleased to be able to reiterate our guidance that we gave and to your point, it does indicate a stronger back cap and we really see the momentum of our actions on all of our back to basic work. We'll fuel that back half and looking forward to a strong top line and bottom-line growth in the back half.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Seth Sigman of Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: Despite the comment about shrink being worse than expected, it sounds like answer to prior question is that it was only a little bit worse. And then there was also another comment about your internal models flashing green. So I'm trying to reconcile all of that, but I guess my real question is around the level of investment required to address shrink, which has been a concern in the market, just cost of doing business going higher. So how confident are you that the investments you're making and including what you've done from a payroll perspective is really fully baked in here and is not going to have to step up again?\nTodd Vasos : Yeah, I just want to reiterate shrink was worse than we thought. It would've been in Q1 but we are seeing those green shoots, which gives us confidence to reiterate our guidance long term. Just want to make sure, we got that point across. But I would tell you that as it relates to all the work we're doing around back to basics, it will continue, we believe, to gain momentum. Everything would show that and many, many of those opportunities that we have to gain momentum directly affect the shrink line. As Kelly indicated, and I also indicated earlier, when you look at inventory levels across the store, I mean a pretty aggressive but impressive reduction in inventory in light of rising sales. And so when you think about that with a 9.5% reduction in per store inventory in 22.5% on our non-con business or discretionary business, we believe all those actions will help that shrink line because too much inventory or over inventory in some instances always leads to additional shrink. So we continue to watch that carefully. Now, the great thing is our inventory is in really good shape as far as the quality and always has been. But we want to make sure that at store level, that it gets to the shelf when it comes in and it gets in front of the consumer as quickly as possible and those levels are so important to make sure that happens. And then as I look at other levers and all the other work we're doing, the expense lines, as you mentioned, we feel confident on where we are today. Wage rates being the largest $150 million investment last year in wages was a strong commitment to grow that consumer awareness and grow our stores in a way that the consumer sees and resonates with. And I believe we're starting to see some of that benefit now. But when you look past that, we believe that we are -- we have the right amount at this point of labor hours inside of our stores. We also, over the many years from really store 2019 to 2023, we've seen a 30 -- over a 30% increase in our average hourly rate as well. And so we've invested there. That's what gives us confidence that we're on the right track. We continue to make those investments where we see needed. The other investment we made this year was we added 120 additional district managers. And that's very important because, again, being an ex-district manager that I was at one point, anytime, a district manager can have less span and control or is able to get to their stores more often, they're able to teach, train, develop, and most importantly solve problems at each and every store that is either his or her responsibility. So those spans of control and reducing those is very important. That should pay dividends as we move through \u201824, as those start to take hold. So we feel good about all the investments we've made. We feel that they were appropriate. We feel that they're right on track. And right now we feel good about where we are and with everything else that we could see today baked into our guidance for the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli : As you guys reduce skews and consumables continue significantly outpace discretionary sales, and that certainly appears to be the case in the stores as well. How do you eventually balance out the relative growth rates of consumables versus discretionary? So you can alleviate some of that margin pressure from mix, or don't you, it just becomes more of a permanent shift in the mix. Thanks.\nTodd Vasos : Yes, we don't believe it's a permanent shift. And let me step back and say again, I believe we're doing exactly the right thing at the right time. You may recall over the years, I've always said we at Dollar General go with the consumer wants us to go, and right now, because of her finances, meaning with the inflation over the last couple years and those pressures that have come with that, this is where she needs us to be right now for her. And we doubled down on that, right? Because we need to take care of her. I believe you see in our comp for Q1 and our transaction growth in Q1 would all benefit what I just said. Meaning that consumer is resonating with that. Now, the thing I do want to point out is that all the work we did around our non-consumable initiatives, through the pandemic and even exiting the pandemic is still alive and well in our stores. And again, when the consumer needs the spend around discretionary right now, she has what she needs at Dollar General. It's proven. We see it, we see it in her spend. So we don't believe that this is a permanent shift. We believe it's temporary. How long we'll wait to see, again, the consumer will tell us that, but in the meantime, we'll go where she wants us to go. We'll have the right products for her that she needs to feed her family, take care of her family in the meantime, but at the same time continue to foster and grow that discretionary side of the business with either even more options and more value as we continue to move through this year and into the back half of the year standing ready and willing and able to serve her when she's ready to start spending more freely on that side.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI.\nMichael Montani : I just wanted to dig into a little bit further the inventory side and supply chain. So on the inventory front, should we expect kind of further reductions at this point, or do you feel like you have what you need and you could start to grow inventory a little bit again. How are in stocks looking? And then just on supply chain, Todd, what's your vision there with the two additional DCs coming in line this year? When can we get kind of optimal product flow back?\nKelly Dilts : So I'll start on that with the inventory question and I'll say reducing inventory still really remains a high priority for us. So we're going to focus on reducing that per store inventory. What that does is really simplifies things both upstream in the supply chain as well as in our stores. And so, we continue to look at that as a high priority. The other piece of that is really around focusing on inventory optimization. And so, we talked a little bit last quarter about some investments that we're making in technology. Those are starting to pay dividends. And so we are really looking on how to right-size the inventory over the next 12 to 18 months from just what we're carrying in the stores and making sure that we are in a better position to serve our customers from an in stock level. We are seeing in stocks. And so we are happy to do that. And I know I've had a shout out to the team a couple of quarters now, but they have just done a fantastic job of both reducing inventory and improving our in stocks. And I'll tell you all along, we have felt really good, and Todd said this earlier about the quality of our inventory, so that's really not our issue. It's really just about getting those levels down so that they're more manageable in the store and in the DCs. And again, felt great about the decreases. Todd called out the numbers, but just to reiterate, we've got a 22.5% decline in that non-consumable inventory. Just huge there. And then, if you don't mind, I'm just going to segue a little bit into cash. One thing that we did see on the inventory management side is what that did for our cash flow. So, our cash from operations was up 247% to last year. And so this is a really important driver, not only from the operations standpoint, but also just lowering our carrying costs and being really impactful to our cash.\nTodd Vasos: And then Kelly, I'll just add on the second part of your question. Again, as I reiterated I'll reiterate, I'm sorry. As I said, we feel good about where our supply chain is right now, and as we bring little Rock Arkansas on later this year and a little closer in our Colorado DC, it'll give us even more confidence as we move forward. Matter of fact, as we also said, out of these temporary facilities that we had we we're already out of seven of those. And the remaining five will come out in 2024. And really the catalyst there will be these two facilities that we open again in Colorado and in Little Rock, Arkansas. So again, I believe that we're well on our way. The consumer is definitely telling us in all the consumer work we've done, they're also saying they're seeing the benefit of that at the shelf, meaning finding what they need more often inside Dollar General. Are we perfect yet? No, but boy, we are light years from where we were and continue to grow that in stock level inside the store. So, all systems seem green there right now, and we continue to benefit from that in stock level and that on time levels from our supply chain.\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisor Group.\nJoe Feldman : Wanted to ask, have you seen any initial green shoots, like you said, in the 12,000 stores that you've remodeled? I know 3,000 just happened in May, but like maybe the original ones that you did, I know it's only four months, but -- if removing the self-checkout has made any kind of measurable difference, I'm wondering if it's changed the flow, has it created longer lines or is it just better for the customer because they're engaged with an associate?\nTodd Vasos: There is no doubt we're getting positive customer feedback across the board on the 9,000 and quite frankly, some of the 3,000 that we did in May. A couple of them have many of them have been for a couple weeks now. So, we're getting that feedback. It's always positive from what we're getting, the vast majority of it from our consumers because they like the interaction at the front of the store. And with that interaction then also comes having somebody at the front of the store very visible at all times, which as you recall was not always the case in 2023. So with that should come as we continue to move through \u201824, better shrink results from that action. Now, we'll watch and see what we believe those are some of those green shoots that we'll start to see even more as you move to the back half of the year and into \u201825. But the overall, reaction from the consumer is, thank you. We like the checkout with someone that we can interact with at all times at the front. That is overwhelmingly what we get. So that really gave us that confidence if you will, to take the other 3,000 and move it to an assisted lane in May from all the good work that we saw happen from the 9,000 we did earlier in the year. And again, that consumer response, which we rely on across the board for all actions that we take, because everything starts and stops with that consumer in the store.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for today. We would like to thank you for your interest in Dollar General and your participation on today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Vasos",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining the call. We are pleased with our start of the year, and I want to recognize the great work of our entire team as they have fully embraced our plan to get back to the basics at Dollar General. On today's call, I will begin by recapping some of the highlights of our Q1 performance, as well as sharing an update on some of our plans for 2024. After that, Kelly will share the details of our Q1 financial performance as well as our current outlook for Q2 and the full year, and then I will wrap up the call with an update on our work in getting back to the basics across the business. Turning to our first quarter performance. Net sales increased 6.1% to $9.9 billion in Q1 compared to net sales of $9.3 billion in the last year's first quarter. These results included accelerated market share growth in both dollars and units in highly consumable product sales, as well as market share growth in dollars in non-consumable product sales. We opened 197 new stores during the quarter and are excited about our ability to continue to expand the number of communities we serve. Same store sales increased 2.4% during the quarter, which was above the top end of our Q1 guidance. We believe this result is a testament to the relevance of Dollar General in our communities and the ongoing positive impact of our back to basics work. The comp sales increase was driven by strong growth in consumer traffic of more than 4% and was partially offset by decline in average transaction amount, primarily driven by fewer items per basket. The comp sales increase was driven entirely by strong growth in our consumable category by customers relied on us for the value of the items they need most often for their families. This growth was partially offset by declines in the home, seasonal and apparel categories. From a cadence perspective, growth was strongest in March, including a benefit of Easter moving from April into March this year, and was relatively similar in the months of February and April. We believe the softness in sales in the discretionary category during Q1 is a reflection of the continued pressure our core customers feel on their spending. They continue to be very value oriented in their shopping behavior, which we see manifested in accelerated share growth in private brand sales, as well as increased engagement with items at or below the $1 price point. Importantly, we continue to do well with our core customers while growing with middle and higher income trade-in customers from adjacent cohorts. We continue to feel very good about our pricing position relative to competitors and other classes of trade, and our value proposition presents significant opportunity for ongoing growth among a wide range of customers. Looking ahead, we expect value to continue to be the most important consideration for customers in multiple income ranges. We know that our customers need us even more when they face economic challenges, and we are well positioned to help them stretch their dollar. Before I turn the call over to Kelly, I want to provide a brief update on our shrink reduction efforts, including the changes to our self-checkout strategy that we announced in March. Shrink continues to be the most significant headwind in our business, and we are deploying an end-to-end approach to shrink reduction across the organization, including efforts in our supply chain merchandising and within our stores to help combat issues around shrink. Our supply chain teams are primarily focused on ensuring deliveries are on time and in full, and our merchants on reducing the amount of inventory we carry. Within our stores, we are focusing on delivering a more consistent front end presence, broaden in the reach of our high shrink planograms, which include the removal of high shrink SKUs and the elimination of self-checkout in the vast majority of stores. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we converted approximately 9,000 stores away from self-checkout during the quarter following the quick and successful conversion of these stores in Q1, and given the ongoing challenge from shrink, we converted approximately 3,000 additional stores away from self-checkout in May, bringing us to approximately 12,000 conversions completed in total. While this represents a significant change in our stores, we believe this is the right course of action to drive increased customer engagement, while also better positioning us to begin reducing shrink in the back half of \u201824 with a more material positive impact expected in 2025. Moving forward, we plan to have self-checkout options available in a limited number of stores, most of which are higher volume and low shrink locations. Overall, we are pleased with the results and progress across the business during the first quarter, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and this team is excited about the work we are doing. We have a long history of serving customers in a variety of economic environments, thanks to our distinctive combination of value and convenience. I also want to note that we recently published our annual servings others report, which provides several important updates on our ongoing ESG efforts and goals. We recognize the great responsibility we have as an essential partner to the communities we call home and are excited about the many ways we are able to serve our customers, associates, communities, and shareholders, and with everyday low prices in store locations within five miles of approximately 75% of the U.S. population. We are uniquely positioned to serve customers and communities across the country. We remain focused on getting back to the basics of Dollar General as we look to enhance the way we serve customers, further develop and support our associates and create a long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Kelly. Thank you, Kelly. Our focus continues to center on our four key operating priorities of driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, leveraging and reinforcing our position as a low cost operator and investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment, and inclusion. As we have discussed to advance these priorities in the near term, we have implemented a refreshed approach to getting back to the basics to enhance store standards and the associate and customer experience in our stores. I want to take the next few minutes to provide an update on these efforts in our supply chain, stores and merchandising. I will start with our stores where everything begins and ends for our customers. As a reminder, we have prioritized increasing the employee presence at the front end of our stores to provide a friendly welcome and elevated level of engagement to our customers, while also facilitating a positive checkout experience. As we have continued to move away from self-checkout in the majority of our stores, we believe this focus is even more important in serving our customers and supporting our sales growth. We have additionally focused more of our labor hours on perpetual inventory management in our stores by adding specific inventory management shifts and specified and specialized inventory training in each store. Our customers are taking note of these efforts as we have seen a significant improvement in their perception of our in-stock levels, which we believe is contributing to our growth in customer traffic, market share, and comp sales. Finally, we have also taken a significant action to make it easier to operate our stores while also enhancing the overall experience for associates and customers. Our supply chain and merchandising teams have made significant strides in serving our stores. In addition to the work we have done in the field, such as reducing district manager's fans of control, simplifying and eliminating certain activities and reducing inventory. We continue to focus on reducing store manager turnover, which is correlated to sales and shrink results in our stores. Notably, while we still have work to do, we are seeing year over year reductions in turnover at all levels within our retail operations, including regional director, district manager, store manager, assistant store manager, and sales associate. We are proud of this progress and excited to see our actions resonating with our team in the field. Overall, we believe the actions in our stores will drive improvements in customer satisfaction, including customer service and on shelf availability and convenience. Enhance the associate experience in the stores including improved employee engagement and retention, and drive improvements in financial results, including sales and shrink. Next, let me provide a quick update on our supply chain. Our top priority in this area continues to be improving our rates of on time and in full truck deliveries, which we refer to as OTIF. Our distribution and transportation teams have taken aggressive action to improve their service to our stores, and these efforts have led to significantly higher OTIF levels compared to the same time last year. When we began our back to basics work last year, we identified an opportunity to exit 12 temporary warehouse facilities, which would lower cost and improve inventory flow throughout our supply chain. Since that time, we have exited seven of these buildings and are in and on track to exit the remainder in 2024. In conjunction with these moves, we are making great progress on our permanent distribution centers in Arkansas and Colorado, both of which are scheduled to open later this year, and which should contribute to a reduction in stem miles and lower transportation cost over time. Finally, we have also begun the first full scale refresh of our sorting process within our distribution centers, since the launch of our Fast Track initiative in 2017. Work has begun on all 18 of our dry facilities with four already completed. We are making quick progress on the others and believe we will finish this work by the end of the year. Once we conclude the resort process, we believe our store teams will be able to restock shelves more quickly, ultimately driving greater on shelf availability for our customers and increase sales. Ultimately, we believe these actions will enhance the agility of our supply chain, allowing us to meet changing demands and respond quickly to challenges, all while driving greater efficiencies and a further improved experience for our store teams and customers. Finally, I want to provide an update on getting back to basics and merchandising. Our team's top priority is always delivering value to the customer, and we continue to innovate on ways to provide the products they want and need at affordable prices. These basics are important to our customer, which is why we remain committed to a strong private brand offering affordable national brands and the $1 price point. Despite the inflationary pressures we have experienced over the last year, we continue to carry approximately 2000 items at or below the $1 price point in the majority of our stores as we help our customers stretch their dollar in our stores each and every day. As Kelly noted, we also continue to focus on meaningfully reducing our inventory position, and the team has done an outstanding job on this front over the past six months. In 2024, we committed to a net reduction of up to 1,000 SKUs within our chain by the end of this year, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. We have already made good progress selling through the remaining inventory and resetting planograms to remove these items from our stores. Importantly, we expect a significant portion of the sales of these secondary and tertiary SKUs will transfer to primary SKUs that will remain in our offering. Finally, our merchants have been working with our operators to identify and execute on simplification opportunities such as reducing the number of floor stands and monthly end cap resets to reduce activities for our store teams. In conjunction with the work of our supply chain teams to optimize the sorting process. Our merchants are also working to increase the number of products that can go straight to the shelf, eliminating the need for extra touches within the store. Collectively, these actions are designed to save time in our stores for our teams, and ultimately result in an improved associate and customer experience. As we wrap up this morning, I want to say again, how proud I am of the team's great work and commitment to getting back to basics as we fulfill our mission of serving others. We are moving with great urgency to implement our back to basics plan and execute on the things that matter most to our customers. And while we are pleased with the positive results, stemming from many of these actions, we recognize that some of our efforts may take longer to deliver the intended benefit, and we'll continue to work to capitalize on these opportunities. I want to thank our more than 186,000 employees for their ongoing engagement and their passion for our customer. This team is energized and confident in our strategy, both near term to restore operational excellence and long term to deliver value for our customers and shareholders alike. I look forward to all that we can accomplish together throughout 2024. With that operator, we will now open the lines for questions. On shrink, I just want to make sure we referenced back to last quarter as we rolled out our back to basics program in earnest over the last few months. We talked about last quarter that some areas will take a little longer to manifest itself in a real positive manner. We called out shrink as being one of those because shrink has the longest tail to it. And quite frankly, we have many levers on shrink that we watch. And we look at each and every quarter. In saying that, the great thing here is that what we're seeing on the shrink front right now is what we thought we would. And that is of the shrink indicators that we watch. And by the way, we use a proprietary predictive model to look at this. We've had this for many years and as you know, over the years, our shrink indicators will would have indicated and have performed in a pretty good manner up until recently. And these predictive models are now flashing green or positive with the majority of the items that we look at for shrink. So in saying that, in a nutshell, we feel pretty good about what that would indicate for the back half of the year, and what that will indicate hopefully for \u201825 and beyond, just like we thought it would. It would come together a little softer in Q1, but again, green shoots, which is really great to see starting to perform. And Kelly, you may want to just mention how it affects the margin overall. And then Michael, I know you had a second part question and as it relates to the promotional activity and what we're seeing from that, as you may recall, we were probably one of the first ones to call out that we believe that the promotional environment would rise in 2024. We made mention that we believe it's going to be more reminiscent to free COVID times, so 2019 type levels, and quite frankly, in Q1, that's exactly what we saw. And we still see it, the same way, today as we move through Q2 and into the back half of the year. So, it's pretty much right on what we thought. And I would tell you that for us, here at Dollar General, we've always done a very good job, as of balancing that everyday value here on the shelf meeting our everyday price, and then seeding in that promotional activity to really show even more value to the consumer. We do that probably as good as anyone. And the great thing about Dollar General is that category management that Kelly just mentioned where we are a large player with almost every CPG company in America. And with that, allows us the opportunity to continue to work with them very closely to help mitigate margin risks from that promotional activity. So we feel good. Everything is contemplated in our guidance, as we move forward. And we feel good about that promotional activity to show good value to the consumer. And it's been resonating. Take a look at our sales for the quarter and our transactions for the quarter. I think the balance is being struck very well here. Matt, what we're seeing from the consumer overall is what we pretty well called out in March, and that is, it's a cautious consumer, I think is the best way to put it. She has definitely flea the value, especially in the lower income stratas. But what we're seeing, like we saw in Q4 what we're seeing is that the next cohort and the one above that, so let's call it middle to upper middle income, and then in some of the upper income stratas, we're seeing the trade down still come in. So we feel good that we're getting new customers in. We can see it in our data, and that we're retaining at a high level those core customers of ours in that lower income strata. She is definitely making trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. And feeding her family and taking care of her family is her number one priority. Inflation has and continues to be top of mind for her. While she does say in our recent work, as you know, we go out each quarter and talk to the consumer. In our recent work, she does indicate, overall year over year, the inflation has slowed down, but what she keeps pointing out is that the inflation that has happened to her over the last couple years is still there. It hasn't gone away. So it's in the base, if you will. And as we had pointed out a couple quarters ago, we don't believe that that is probably going to dissipate as we continue to move forward. So our core consumer is still continuing to figure out her overall spending rates. Now, the great thing and as your second question asked was that consumable versus non-consumable mix. And what we saw in Q1 is in those times when the consumer wants to spend more, let's talk about Easter for a moment. We saw Easter was very good for us both on the consumable and the non-consumable side of that discretionary side of the equation. So, she has the ability to spend some, but she's very deliberate with that spend. And so we need to continue to show her value even in the discretionary areas. So what that signals to us is that she continues to figure out her income levels because she is spending on some of that discretionary. So we'll continue to foster that as we move through Q2 and beyond. And we believe it's fully contemplated in our low twos guidance that we gave in Q2. And then lastly, on our back to basics work. Thanks for asking that because we're proud of what we've done so far. If you recall, we talked about starting at about our own 20 yard line. If I can revert back to my football analogy for a moment, I would tell you that we're at or just crossing the 50 yard line now as we exited Q1, that's quite a move very quickly, I would tell you, and you asked a few of the components are moving even quicker. So I would tell you in our supply chain, very happy with what we're seeing there. Has moved well past the 50 and probably more on the 40 yard line on the other side of the field. So feeling very good about that. Our on time and in full rates have been very stable and top-notch for many weeks now. And that stability is really the key. If you remember me saying that last time, that consistency is where the stores start to feel it and the customers feel it the most. And we're starting to see that, materialize and have been for the last few weeks. As it relates to our merchandising side, I would tell you we're squarely across the 50 as well with some of our biggest components yet to come in Q2 and in the into early Q3, all the pipe has been laid for that. And we are already starting to see some of that benefit as we worked in the Q2 here. And then our operations inside of our stores and our field. I'm very proud of what they've done so far, because everything we've done back of house is now starting to manifest itself at store level. And so, I would tell you that we're squarely on the 50 yard line there as well. And I know that the team is squarely focused on moving the ball down the field in Q2 there. And I believe that, with the back of the house indicators that we see right now, I believe that that's going to happen as we move forward. Shrink is still, as we indicated probably the laggard there. We knew it would be the laggard. This is not a surprise. A little worse than we thought in Q1, but overall, not a surprise that it's going to tail everything else. But again, those green shoots I mentioned earlier really give us the confidence to reiterate our guidance for full year, because we're starting to see some of that occur. And of course, those positive sales and transactions, I don't want to minimize that. You have to take a look at that and be very positive, because the consumer is seeing the difference inside of our stores. A big difference in turn over the last couple quarters. So stay tuned. We feel pretty good. You could probably tell by my enthusiasm and the voice that we're seeing some real positives from all the work that we're doing Matt. Let me actually answer the second one first and I'll turn it over to Kelly for your first question. Again, the promotional environment is nearly exactly what we thought it would be. A little higher in Q1, but I would tell you that we knew this is the way the consumer was going to react. And we knew, and we said this in Q4, the way CPG would react because they're looking to move units as well. So, I would tell you that, this is probably both a CPG and a customer push into some of this promotional activity. Now, in saying that we feel great about our everyday price, as I indicated on the prepared remarks, we are right in line with everyday price against all classes of trade. We feel good about that. We continually invest in price and imp, impress and value at the shelf. And then the other thing to keep in mind is our expansive and growing private brand business has been very stable and solid, and growing quite frankly in Q1. And that important and magic $1 price point continues to be one of our best performers in the quarter. So we're showing value at all different spots for the consumer. And it's resonating. I mean, when you look at that transaction growth across Q1, I think, one would say it's resonating heavily with the consumer at this point. So we feel good about all of our pricing across the board, but we continue to watch it. We'll continue to watch all classes of trade. We will make adjustments if need be as we move through Q2 and beyond. But right now, the customer is reacting exactly like we thought she would, we know how to do this. We've been doing this for a long time and this category management team that we have here built in 2008 continues to be strong and continues to be working all the levers that we know how to do here at Dollar General. Yes, I would tell you that our non-consumer discretionary business, as I mentioned earlier, it's still alive and well. It's just the consumer is making those trade-offs in the store and at the shelf. But I would tell you again, during those important times when discretionary is important to her family, she has the ability to spend. So that shows you that and gives us confidence that we have the right products for the consumer at the right value and price. And as we continue to move through Q2 and beyond, we believe layering in some promotional activity and discretionary, like we are in our core non-consumable areas, excuse me, was -- is probably the right thing to do. So we believe a nice balance of both will help the consumer stay engaged in the discretionary side of the business. I have seen, looked at seen and are am very pleased with the holiday lineup we've got coming up. I know it's a little premature, but it never is when we start talking about holiday because it has such a long lead time coming in. And the lineup we have this year is very strong for the back half of the year as well. So more to come. I believe we've got all the right building blocks in place for the discretionary side of the business to continue to get healthier and healthier as we move through the back half of the year. Yeah, I just want to reiterate shrink was worse than we thought. It would've been in Q1 but we are seeing those green shoots, which gives us confidence to reiterate our guidance long term. Just want to make sure, we got that point across. But I would tell you that as it relates to all the work we're doing around back to basics, it will continue, we believe, to gain momentum. Everything would show that and many, many of those opportunities that we have to gain momentum directly affect the shrink line. As Kelly indicated, and I also indicated earlier, when you look at inventory levels across the store, I mean a pretty aggressive but impressive reduction in inventory in light of rising sales. And so when you think about that with a 9.5% reduction in per store inventory in 22.5% on our non-con business or discretionary business, we believe all those actions will help that shrink line because too much inventory or over inventory in some instances always leads to additional shrink. So we continue to watch that carefully. Now, the great thing is our inventory is in really good shape as far as the quality and always has been. But we want to make sure that at store level, that it gets to the shelf when it comes in and it gets in front of the consumer as quickly as possible and those levels are so important to make sure that happens. And then as I look at other levers and all the other work we're doing, the expense lines, as you mentioned, we feel confident on where we are today. Wage rates being the largest $150 million investment last year in wages was a strong commitment to grow that consumer awareness and grow our stores in a way that the consumer sees and resonates with. And I believe we're starting to see some of that benefit now. But when you look past that, we believe that we are -- we have the right amount at this point of labor hours inside of our stores. We also, over the many years from really store 2019 to 2023, we've seen a 30 -- over a 30% increase in our average hourly rate as well. And so we've invested there. That's what gives us confidence that we're on the right track. We continue to make those investments where we see needed. The other investment we made this year was we added 120 additional district managers. And that's very important because, again, being an ex-district manager that I was at one point, anytime, a district manager can have less span and control or is able to get to their stores more often, they're able to teach, train, develop, and most importantly solve problems at each and every store that is either his or her responsibility. So those spans of control and reducing those is very important. That should pay dividends as we move through \u201824, as those start to take hold. So we feel good about all the investments we've made. We feel that they were appropriate. We feel that they're right on track. And right now we feel good about where we are and with everything else that we could see today baked into our guidance for the rest of the year. Yes, we don't believe it's a permanent shift. And let me step back and say again, I believe we're doing exactly the right thing at the right time. You may recall over the years, I've always said we at Dollar General go with the consumer wants us to go, and right now, because of her finances, meaning with the inflation over the last couple years and those pressures that have come with that, this is where she needs us to be right now for her. And we doubled down on that, right? Because we need to take care of her. I believe you see in our comp for Q1 and our transaction growth in Q1 would all benefit what I just said. Meaning that consumer is resonating with that. Now, the thing I do want to point out is that all the work we did around our non-consumable initiatives, through the pandemic and even exiting the pandemic is still alive and well in our stores. And again, when the consumer needs the spend around discretionary right now, she has what she needs at Dollar General. It's proven. We see it, we see it in her spend. So we don't believe that this is a permanent shift. We believe it's temporary. How long we'll wait to see, again, the consumer will tell us that, but in the meantime, we'll go where she wants us to go. We'll have the right products for her that she needs to feed her family, take care of her family in the meantime, but at the same time continue to foster and grow that discretionary side of the business with either even more options and more value as we continue to move through this year and into the back half of the year standing ready and willing and able to serve her when she's ready to start spending more freely on that side. And then Kelly, I'll just add on the second part of your question. Again, as I reiterated I'll reiterate, I'm sorry. As I said, we feel good about where our supply chain is right now, and as we bring little Rock Arkansas on later this year and a little closer in our Colorado DC, it'll give us even more confidence as we move forward. Matter of fact, as we also said, out of these temporary facilities that we had we we're already out of seven of those. And the remaining five will come out in 2024. And really the catalyst there will be these two facilities that we open again in Colorado and in Little Rock, Arkansas. So again, I believe that we're well on our way. The consumer is definitely telling us in all the consumer work we've done, they're also saying they're seeing the benefit of that at the shelf, meaning finding what they need more often inside Dollar General. Are we perfect yet? No, but boy, we are light years from where we were and continue to grow that in stock level inside the store. So, all systems seem green there right now, and we continue to benefit from that in stock level and that on time levels from our supply chain. There is no doubt we're getting positive customer feedback across the board on the 9,000 and quite frankly, some of the 3,000 that we did in May. A couple of them have many of them have been for a couple weeks now. So, we're getting that feedback. It's always positive from what we're getting, the vast majority of it from our consumers because they like the interaction at the front of the store. And with that interaction then also comes having somebody at the front of the store very visible at all times, which as you recall was not always the case in 2023. So with that should come as we continue to move through \u201824, better shrink results from that action. Now, we'll watch and see what we believe those are some of those green shoots that we'll start to see even more as you move to the back half of the year and into \u201825. But the overall, reaction from the consumer is, thank you. We like the checkout with someone that we can interact with at all times at the front. That is overwhelmingly what we get. So that really gave us that confidence if you will, to take the other 3,000 and move it to an assisted lane in May from all the good work that we saw happen from the 9,000 we did earlier in the year. And again, that consumer response, which we rely on across the board for all actions that we take, because everything starts and stops with that consumer in the store."

            "name": "Kelly Dilts",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. As Todd already discussed sales, I'll start with gross profit. For Q1, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2%, a decrease of 145 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in shrink and markdowns, a greater consumable sales mix and lower inventory markups. These were partially offset by a lower LIFO provision. Shrink continues to be our most significant headwind and with 59 basis points worse in the first quarter compared to prior year. As Todd noted, we are taking multiple actions aimed at reducing shrink, and I'll discuss our expectation for this headwind for the remainder of the year in just a bit. With regards to markdowns, we're seeing promotional levels more similar to 2019 levels as we anticipated coming into the year. As Todd noted, customers are seeking value and we saw strong take rates on promotional items during the first quarter. Turning to SG&A, it was 24.7% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 97 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by retail labor, depreciation and amortization, incentive compensation and repairs and maintenance. Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the first quarter decreased 26.3% to $546 million. As a percentage of sales operating profit was 5.5%, a decrease of 242 basis points. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased to $72 million compared to $83 million in last year's first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% and compares to 21.8% in the first quarter last year. This higher rate is primarily due to the effect of certain rate impacting items on lower earnings before taxes and expense recognition attributable to stock-based compensation. Finally, EPS for the quarter decreased 29.5% to $1.65, which exceeded the high end of our internal expectations. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Merchandise inventories were $6.9 billion at the end of Q1, a decrease of 5.5% compared to prior year and a decrease of 9.5% on a per store basis. Notably, total non-consumable inventory decreased 19.1% compared to last year and decreased 22.5% on a per store basis. The team continues to do great work reducing our overall inventory position, while simultaneously optimizing our mix and driving higher end stocks. We're pleased with the significant progress on this important goal, which not only frees up more cash in the business, but also helps to mitigate further shrink risk. And importantly, we continue to believe the quality of our inventory remains good. The business generated cash flows from operations of $664 million during the quarter, an increase of 247% as we improved our working capital primarily through inventory management. Total capital expenditures were $342 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations distribution and transportation projects, and spending related to our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend of $0.59 per common share outstanding for a total payout of $130 million. Overall, we're pleased with our progress and proud of these results, including gains in customer traffic and market share, significantly lower inventory levels, and improved cash flow from operations. Moving to our financial outlooks for fiscal 2024, while it's still early in the year, we believe our positive first quarter results reinforce the importance of our stores to the communities we serve, as well as the progress of our back to basics work. With that in mind, we're reiterating our financial guidance for 2024 and continue to expect net sales growth in the range of approximately 6% to 6.7%, same store sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.7% and EPS in the range of $6.80 to $7.55. This guidance continues to assume an estimated negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.50 due to higher incentive compensation expense and an effective tax rate in a range of approximately 22.5% to 23.5%. We also continue to anticipate capital spending in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we invest to drive ongoing growth. We continually evaluate and seek to optimize the use of this capital, and as a result we have updated our expectations for real estate projects in 2024. We now expect to remodel approximately 1,620 stores this year compared to our previous expectation of 1,500 remodels. To facilitate this increase in remodels, we're reducing the number of planned new stores to 730 compared to our previous expectation of 800 new stores. We continue to expect to relocate 85 stores. In total, this increases our expected total real estate project count from 2,385 to approximately 2,435. We're excited about this increase in projects and the expanded investment in our mature stores, and we believe this is an appropriate reallocation of our capital. As a reminder, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we believe they continue to serve us well. Our first priority is investing in our business, including our existing store base, as well as high return organic growth opportunities such as new store expansion and strategic initiatives. Next, we seek to return cash to shareholders through a quarterly dividend payment and over time and when appropriate share repurchases. Finally, although our leverage ratio is currently above our target of approximately 3x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR, we are focused on improving our debt metrics in support of our commitment to our current investment grade credit ratings, which as a reminder are BBB and Baa2. Now let me provide some additional context as it relates to our outlook for 2024. Our customer continues to be very value driven and we anticipate they will continue to be price sensitive as we move through the year. With this in mind, we expect sales mix pressure to be above our original expectation, and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen and continue to expect the promotional environment reversion to pre pandemic levels as we move throughout 2024. As such, we expect our promotional markdown headwinds to gross margin will continue at least through the first half of the year. As Todd noted, shrink is currently trending worse than we initially expected coming into the year, and we now expect this headwind to be greater in 2024 than what was originally contemplated in the financial guidance we provided on our earnings call in March. We're taking aggressive and decisive action to mitigate this challenge, and we're expecting to see improvement later in the back half of 2024 than we had previously anticipated and more significantly into 2025. Turning to SG&A, our expectations are relatively unchanged from what we previously provided on our Q4 call. We continue to anticipate a significant headwind this year from the normalization of incentive compensation in 2024, as well as an ongoing headwind from depreciation and amortization, while we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given the somewhat atypical cadence of this year and some of its specific headwinds, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the second quarter. To that end, we expect comp sales to increase in the low 2% range in the second quarter with EPS in the range of approximately $1.70 to $1.85. In summary, we're pleased with the solid start to our year, including exceeding our top and bottom-line expectations for first quarter. We believe our actions are resonating with our customers, strengthening our competitive position and reinforcing our foundation for future growth. We remain committed to maintaining our discipline in how we manage expenses and capital as a low cost operator with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We continue to believe that this model is resilient and strong. We're excited about the long-term future of this business, including plans to drive profitable, same store sales and meaningful operating margin growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow, and long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd. No, absolutely. So it takes a little while for some of that improvement to show up in our financial results, which is why we're calling it out. So we do expect to see improvement in the second half of the year and even more meaningfully into 2025 as we work through that. I think your other question was just what are we doing to work to offset any of those risks? And I'll tell you, we have a lot underway as we typically do, where our goal is always to improve margins. And so, some of the underlying drivers that we still have in place as we work through the shrink piece include DG Media network. So, looking for some meaningful contribution there. We still have private brands which generate better margins than some of the national brands, and it's certainly something that our consumer is looking for now. We have got global sourcing category management, which is just huge here at Dollar General. And certainly, a way to offset any of the risks that we see in the near term. And then of course, inventory optimization, which the team has done just a fantastic job of focusing on and finally supply chain efficiencies. Certainly, we are continuing to look for those efficiencies as we move through this year and frankly as we move through each and every year. So I think with all of those underlying drivers and just delivering on our back to basics actions on driving sales and lowering shrink, we feel good that we're strengthening that foundation for the long term and into the back half of the year. Yes, thanks for the question, Kate. And just to level set everyone. So we are reducing the number of new stores this year. It's by about 70 stores, and what we're going do is move them into 2025. So we feel really good about the locations that we have identified. We're just pushing them out into to 2025. And what that does is free up capital in order to increase the number of remodels and the total real estate project count that we have. So I have to tell you, we're really excited about this increase in projects with the expanded investment particularly in our mature stores. And we think this is absolutely the appropriate reallocation of capital, especially with our back-to-basics work. And so, stay tuned for 2025, but for right now, we feel really good about this reallocation. And just if -- as taking a look at the longer term and we talked about this just a minute ago, we're certainly doing everything with our back to basics actions to strengthen that foundation for longer term growth with driving sales and working on lowering shrink. We still feel great about the fundamentals of this business. We're growing share, we're growing traffic. We had good healthy comps. We're generating a lot of cash, so the model is absolutely intact. As we look forward, we still have a nice long way -- long runway for growth, and that that's new stores and our remodel program. So feel good about that. We feel good about generating a significant amount of cash flow and the investments that we're making in our business now as we look forward to how that will return in the future. And then of course, soon as we reach the target of our debt leverage, we'll be returning cash back to shareholders when appropriate on in the form of share repurchases. And so, given all of that, I would say that where we're at right now from an operating margin perspective, we know we have a lot of opportunity and we are always looking to improve our operating margin. You heard me talk about a lot of the longer-term levers that we have and some in the shorter term around the gross margin side of things, but we also have our save to serve approach to controlling costs, which is also a huge benefit to drive operating margin as well. So we certainly feel like we can do that from here. And I would tell you that we believe this business is going to return to a 10% to 10% plus EPS growth on an adjusted basis over the longer term. Yes, thanks Rupesh. I would say we are certainly pleased to be able to reiterate our guidance that we gave and to your point, it does indicate a stronger back cap and we really see the momentum of our actions on all of our back to basic work. We'll fuel that back half and looking forward to a strong top line and bottom-line growth in the back half. So I'll start on that with the inventory question and I'll say reducing inventory still really remains a high priority for us. So we're going to focus on reducing that per store inventory. What that does is really simplifies things both upstream in the supply chain as well as in our stores. And so, we continue to look at that as a high priority. The other piece of that is really around focusing on inventory optimization. And so, we talked a little bit last quarter about some investments that we're making in technology. Those are starting to pay dividends. And so we are really looking on how to right-size the inventory over the next 12 to 18 months from just what we're carrying in the stores and making sure that we are in a better position to serve our customers from an in stock level. We are seeing in stocks. And so we are happy to do that. And I know I've had a shout out to the team a couple of quarters now, but they have just done a fantastic job of both reducing inventory and improving our in stocks. And I'll tell you all along, we have felt really good, and Todd said this earlier about the quality of our inventory, so that's really not our issue. It's really just about getting those levels down so that they're more manageable in the store and in the DCs. And again, felt great about the decreases. Todd called out the numbers, but just to reiterate, we've got a 22.5% decline in that non-consumable inventory. Just huge there. And then, if you don't mind, I'm just going to segue a little bit into cash. One thing that we did see on the inventory management side is what that did for our cash flow. So, our cash from operations was up 247% to last year. And so this is a really important driver, not only from the operations standpoint, but also just lowering our carrying costs and being really impactful to our cash."
