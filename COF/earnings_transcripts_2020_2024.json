All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much Keith and welcome everybody to Capital One's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the internet, please log onto Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our fourth quarter 2020 results.\nScott Blackley: Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year Capital One earned $2.7 billion or $5.18 per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were two small adjusting items which were outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $5.79. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year the investment gain was $535 million or around $0.89 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released $593 million of allowance primarily in our card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December. The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bills. In our allowance we continue to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to historic norm and we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID related uncertainty. In our commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for the specific reserves that were previously established for those loans.\nRich Fairbank: Thanks Scott. As I think everyone on this call knows Scott shared with me in November that he would be leaving Capital One to join a tech startup, while he will be here through March 15. This will be Scott's last earnings call. I'm going to take a moment and thank you Scott for giving so much of your life to Capital One over this past decade including the last five years as our CFO. You've built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community and you've always brought their external perspectives through our work inside of Capital One. You've been a key advisor and partner for me and for the board and a strong leader in our company. I'm particularly grateful for the legacy you've built. Transforming finance technology, strengthening processes and controls, building a great team of talented leaders including your successor Andrew Young. We will miss you and I'm sure you will continue to do great things. With that, let me turn to our domestic card business. Exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of domestic card financial results in the quarter. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter 2.69%, a 163 basis points improvements year-over-year and a 95 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.42%, a 151 basis points better than the prior year. The delinquency rate was up 21 basis points from the linked quarter consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.1 billion year-over-year driven by the allowance released that Scott discussed and lower charge-offs. Several factors are driving continued credit strength. Consumers are behaving cautiously spending less, saving more and paying down debt. These behaviors have been amplified by the accumulative effect of unusually large government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. Our own longstanding resilience choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic and our strategic investments in digital technology and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting better powering our performance and response to the pandemic. Strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout 2020 even after the expiration of several parts of the CARES Act. Uncertainty about future credit trends remains high especially in the context of an evolving pandemic that is difficult to predict. As Scott discussed that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss.\nJeff Norris: Thanks Rich. Scott let me add my personal thanks for all the coaching and leadership. It's been a pleasure to work with you over the years and I wish all the success as you go forward. And now we'll start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts, who may wish to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session. The Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  we'll take our first question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Scott, congratulations and Andrew I think when you look back Scott leaving you with $15.5 billion reserve is probably the best gift he could give you. I wanted to talk a little bit about that, when we look versus day one, the reserve is now up $5 billion. I'm curious when we look at the current credit metrics. What do you think that scenarios would have to be to actually really utilize that reserve over the lifetime?\nScott Blackley: Rick, well thanks for your kind words and I appreciate both Rich and Jeff saying such nice things. It's been honestly just a privilege to be at this company and its certainly tough place to leave. But let me return to your question. In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies there's a big gap and I would just point out that, that is because right now our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes which gives sense, which is sensible given kind of the circumstance that we're in at the moment and so I think that the biggest driver where the allowance might go and what might drive releases is frankly just certainty and narrowing down the range of possible outcomes. I think could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccines, reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen overtime versus the step function so I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways overtime.\nRick Shane: Got it, okay. Thank you and we're looking forward to seeing you in the Bay Area.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Congratulations Scott. I guess I have a question on marketing expense and efficiency ratio target that you guys outlined some time ago. When we look at the marketing expense, it seems like run rate wise we're back to 2019 levels on a quarterly basis. Can you guys actually exceed that going forward is there's opportunity in the market size? And then as far as the efficiency ratios concerned, I mean how long before we can get back to the 52% target that you had outlined, Rich?\nRich Fairbank: Sanjay, good evening. We're not making specific guidance about marketing as you know this is while there are certain things that are sort of mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. But let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. we pulled back early in the crisis but since increased marketing spend as you saw in Q4 and as expected the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we are seeing opportunities to invest. We continue to invest in our brand, in our national banking strategy and in our card businesses we're leaning in where we see signs of strength and we feel pretty good about origination opportunities and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well. So we're keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace, but we do see opportunities and we're investing in them. And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we have talked about in prior years driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech transformation. The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get particularly on revenue growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory and we're still on the same efficiency journey. But how the pandemic and the recession will play out remains uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds and also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates which certainly it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company that's another thing that holds back the growth. So we're leaning into really in the growth opportunities but and we're on the same kind of heading to the same destinations we talked about before. But we're not giving guidance about the timing.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Wolf Research.\nBill Carcache: Let me add my congratulations. Scott, I wanted to ask about the buyback authorization. Is it reasonable to expect that you seem to be as aggressive as possible and executed on it such that you continue to do the form up by the end of 2021 assuming a favorable backdrop where the fed withdraws payout restrictions? And then within that, how are you guys thinking about the regulatory capital impacted the CECL  for day one and two under the CARES Act.\nScott Blackley: Thanks for the question Bill. With respect to the share buyback program I think the most important thing I just want to underscore is that, the $7.5 billion that was authorized by the board really underscores our commitment to returning excess capital to the shareholders and I think that we're certainly excited to start that journey. As we think about capital deployment, the hierarchy there is first capital to growth opportunities and then share buybacks and dividends to follow and I would just point out in our past practice you can see that we manage share buybacks dynamically and we take into account market conditions, relative value, our holistic view on where we are in our capital position. In the first quarter we'll be limited $500 million I mentioned that based on the fed rules, after that the pacing of the share repurchase are really going to be guided by the factors I just talked about and by any regulatory guidelines that we might see. I'll just say that, we find our current valuation compelling and with over $8 billion of excess capital, we're really looking forward to getting started on the program.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Rich, you embarked on your digital banking transformation several years ago and at that point of time the attempt was to scale a traditional bank and using a digital platform where you could do lot more for your customers and really with simple side fashion over digital channels that digital banking I think has changed with the development of companies like  and some of the fintech companies kind of getting into call center banking offerings with digital wallets with no asset. I'm wondering, does that - the development of migration of digital banking overall, does that effect how you see investments going forward to Capital One?\nRich Fairbank: Well everything that we see John I think reinforces our conviction about the strategy that we have and the journey that we're on and the destination we're so energetically pursuing. First of all, talk about the pandemic. I don't think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking but it changed the timing of that because it accelerated the digital journey and one thing that's been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades and so one of the challenges for any digital bank is, how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch and so it's really nice being on in a sense the right side of history because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in these inevitable trends this year. So that's a good thing for us and we want to capitalize on that. Now the other along the way not surprisingly we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs and we've watched with great interest their strategies in many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences in some cases they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with and we look with interest in that and in many ways root for their success because it's all part of the same - their success is the manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of respect for some of the players, we're impressed by their innovation and we've energized by their success and the success that we're having and so as a result we're leaning in  delaying and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy.\nJohn Hecht: Appreciate the context. Thank you very much.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Rich, in terms of the fintech discussion. I was wondering if you could comment on buy now, pay later, does that impact your business from a wanting competition perspective or syndicated risk standpoint and bit material for us to keep an eye on from a risk perspective.\nRich Fairbank: So now buy now, pay later is a really interesting marketplace. It's kind of ironic because the original buy now, pay later product for the credit cards and so it's interesting to be a very established credit card players and feel a little bit like the old guard as we're watching these innovations on buy now, pay later and I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things, the success of the point-of-sale lending products. And point of sale lending as of course existed since really the beginning of lending itself. I think what's striking here is the way that it exist of course in the ecommerce space, the way it's got shelf space right there at the checkout page, some of the elegance of the digital technology and interestingly right now sort of financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers and that tends to create a healthy marketplace, it tends to create better selection dynamic then very often you see in some of the short-term lending products they tend to have very high effective APRs and things can sometimes axiomatically to adverse selection. So thing to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from some of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the - in a sense the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space. So that's something we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One to learn in this marketplace and we're watching it closely and we really with interest look to see how this opportunity evolves.\nJeff Norris: We'll take next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Scott, congratulations. Rich, maybe just to dig in a little bit further on the efficiency. I understand that you don't want to put a timeframe on it. However if we look at the performance this year, we're in 46% range still about 400 basis points from the 42% target that you had laid out so. Can you maybe just talk about the path to getting there from a financial perspective? Is it all about the return of card loan growth and the revenue growth that comes with it? Or is there more the digital transformation on the cost side? And if cost is part of it can you maybe just talk about what some of those drivers are and what the timing is in terms of us getting there? Thank you.\nRich Fairbank: Yes, so Ryan. The efficiency our journey and the success we had over a number of years really till the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven kind of mathematically of course by the two factors sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operational model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiencies ratio down over the years are going to be same drivers going forward. At the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, there were a lot of things coming together not only on the efficiency side things like getting out data centers, things like the step up that in the Walmart revenue sharing relationship but very much we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses particularly our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back and so I would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are in fact enabling the revenue growth and one thing that we talk about is, that we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation and in many ways this will be a lifelong transformation that this has been starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey and overtime we've been working our way up the tech stack and the more we get up the tech stack, the more the opportunities are things that will actually the world can see things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth and that's why I mentioned on my comments about marketing is that, some of the marketing opportunities we see are in fact specifically enabled by our tech transformation. So therefore while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities and we really want to take advantage of those, we're leaning in and of course it takes investment to do that. So that's why I think revenue growth is I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really the key is having revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses of course.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: So Rich in the past you've had a tendency to see the loan growth lag the marketing spend and account growth based upon credit lines and talked about the need to kind of incubate those accounts and increase the credit lines overtime to get that balance and revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about where you sit in that now given the unusual nature kind of where we in the economic cycle?\nRich Fairbank: Thank you, Moshe. With our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how in many ways the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there is extra caution and you will remember Moshe, in the probably 18 months prior to this downturn maybe two years we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we're so long in the tooth on this economy and so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunity one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities one customer at a time. But collectively pulling up on this we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines and as we do that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get from originations which we're also leaning into.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it and maybe as a follow-up, when I would get the question in the past about what could cause rewards rates to kind of moderate or come down. It's said an economic downturn and obviously we've got some form as an economic downturn. If anything it's gone the other way, any thoughts about kind of intensity of rewards competition and how to think about that into the next year or two?\nRich Fairbank: As you know it's a really interesting question, Moshe. Whether a downturn caused this rewards rates to go down or up. So the case for down in other words for people for the competition to get less intense about that is the people are pulling back, they're spending less and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they're about trying to grow quite a bit. Here's a flipside to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug of war and that is that what is most striking about the pullback probably true in any downturn, but especially in this one is how much of pullback there is been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders and I think that not just the point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on which is to travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others and those of the sectors that have been absolutely whacked  here. It's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well on a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending, travel opportunities and things like that don't necessarily work so enticing and certainly the case in this downturn. And so I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducement to generate the volumes that people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward levels and I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment even though paradoxically it's associated with so much pullback.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: My question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here. I know the questions asked a little bit. But the reason I'm raising it is, I think you said that your reserve today is based on unemployment rate of 8% at 2021, I know there's lot more inputs than just that. But that 8% at year-end 2021 is similar to last quarters. Yet at the same time I know Rich you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a reduction of peak, if not a push out. So how should I triangulate that, should we be anticipating in a more aggressive reserve releases at the quarters come through that are not so bad? Or is there something else going on in the reserve analysis that we should be thinking about?\nScott Blackley: Betsy, why don't I take that one? So look I think that the - as I mentioned a couple times, I think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing all of the scenarios in thinking about that and that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk. And so even in the current quarter where you're right our 2021 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. During the full year we're expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago and so that coupled with we saw the passage at stimulus were both factors that drove the release this quarter. but we still have even with the positive trends we put on even more qualitative factors because it is just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out and we're in the allowance we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today and I really do believe that we will overtime see that in a play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize and if it doesn't normalize then we're going to have allowance releases and they're going to come in overtime. But until we start to see kind of more evidence that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take the final question from Bob Napoli, please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: And congratulations Scott look forward to hearing where you're headed.\nScott Blackley: Thanks Bob.\nBob Napoli: Rich question on the just on the tech investment. The amount  if you can quantify at all for us maybe Scott the amount you're spending on technology versus several years ago, the growth in those investment and then maybe more importantly what do you feel differentiate you the most from other banks or fintechs with the changes or the upgrades in the technology and what's on the roadmap for further upgrades?\nRich Fairbank: Okay, Bob. We don't breakout our tech investment but Capital One I think relative to banks on our side invest quite a bit in technology then my sense is of what other banks our size invest in, by the way, our primary competitive set is the big national banks and they check  tech budgets, so we certainly know also what we're up against. But let me just talk about again so philosophically what we've done. I think what most banks - I think companies in general when they're looking everybody know they got to invest more in technology and even as recently this quarter so companies said they're increasing their technology spend and I almost can't image the companies not feeling the need to do that as they face and accelerating digital revolution. A thing that very common that companies do is, they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack. Meaning the things that are closest to the consumer investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or associates for things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements and there is no, it's a very natural thing to do. Capital One has taken the unlikely journey, a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at courses  and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this things bringing lots of thing in house, bringing a lot of engineering in house and it's been a journey that and you know this Bob and other investors on this call know that they would often say I know you're investing a lot, you're talking about it, but I can't see it because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see and this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock this journey that we're going through. What we so deeply believe that at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go, one really needs a modern tech stacks and that's a hard thing for startup bank to build. It's really hard thing for a legacy company to build and I think it was little easier for Capital One only that we were in a sense an original fintech three decades ago and so maybe don't have as much legacy as modest companies do. But it's still been a very significant journey. But I think when you say, how do we compare ourselves with other companies? I think other companies have I think there's a lot of good things other companies go are doing. They have really nice apps for their customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world and I think it was the little bit of shock to some folks when one day we said by the way we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud and that's the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of the and it's not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have in fact made that journey. Now where does - but what it puts in a position to do, is that is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like tech company and be able to be more dynamic faster to the market, create, offer better products, better customer experience and that give us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution and enables us to build our national bank and lean into that and enables us to win some partnerships that in head to head competition. I feel that we won by virtue of some of the tech capabilities we had and it enables to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on - well partly tech on tech cost like massive vendor cost that we can say. But at the same time we're investing a lot in tech so the big in that savings is not so much tech cost as it is the opportunity to reduce analog cost overtime. So that's kind of long answer to your question. But when we looked out and said overtime, we are going to want to do that or we're going to do  this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there. In each case we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do and we're well down that path. We're not done in many ways it's a lifelong journey but I think our opportunities are increasing as we get further down this path.\nBob Napoli: Thank you really appreciate the detailed answer.\nJeff Norris: Thank you everybody for joining this conference call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on this conference call today. Thank you for your continued interest in Capital One and remember that the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good evening, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We're not making specific guidance about marketing as you know this is while there are certain things that are sort of mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. But let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. we pulled back early in the crisis but since increased marketing spend as you saw in Q4 and as expected the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we are seeing opportunities to invest.

So we're keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace, but we do see opportunities and we're investing in them. And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we have talked about in prior years driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech transformation. The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get particularly on revenue growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory and we're still on the same efficiency journey. But how the pandemic and the recession will play out remains uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds and also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates which certainly it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company that's another thing that holds back the growth. So we're leaning into really in the growth opportunities but and we're on the same kind of heading to the same destinations we talked about before. But we're not giving guidance about the timing. Well everything that we see John I think reinforces our conviction about the strategy that we have and the journey that we're on and the destination we're so energetically pursuing. First of all, talk about the pandemic. I don't think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking but it changed the timing of that because it accelerated the digital journey and one thing that's been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades and so one of the challenges for any digital bank is, how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch and so it's really nice being on in a sense the right side of history because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in these inevitable trends this year. So that's a good thing for us and we want to capitalize on that. Now the other along the way not surprisingly we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs and we've watched with great interest their strategies in many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences in some cases they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with and we look with interest in that and in many ways root for their success because it's all part of the same - their success is the manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of respect for some of the players, we're impressed by their innovation and we've energized by their success and the success that we're having and so as a result we're leaning in  delaying and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy. So now buy now, pay later is a really interesting marketplace. It's kind of ironic because the original buy now, pay later product for the credit cards and so it's interesting to be a very established credit card players and feel a little bit like the old guard as we're watching these innovations on buy now, pay later and I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things, the success of the point-of-sale lending products. And point of sale lending as of course existed since really the beginning of lending itself. I think what's striking here is the way that it exist of course in the ecommerce space, the way it's got shelf space right there at the checkout page, some of the elegance of the digital technology and interestingly right now sort of financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers and that tends to create a healthy marketplace, it tends to create better selection dynamic then very often you see in some of the short-term lending products they tend to have very high effective APRs and things can sometimes axiomatically to adverse selection. So thing to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from some of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the - in a sense the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space. So that's something we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One to learn in this marketplace and we're watching it closely and we really with interest look to see how this opportunity evolves. Yes, so Ryan. The efficiency our journey and the success we had over a number of years really till the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven kind of mathematically of course by the two factors sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operational model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiencies ratio down over the years are going to be same drivers going forward. At the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, there were a lot of things coming together not only on the efficiency side things like getting out data centers, things like the step up that in the Walmart revenue sharing relationship but very much we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses particularly our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back and so I would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are in fact enabling the revenue growth and one thing that we talk about is, that we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation and in many ways this will be a lifelong transformation that this has been starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey and overtime we've been working our way up the tech stack and the more we get up the tech stack, the more the opportunities are things that will actually the world can see things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth and that's why I mentioned on my comments about marketing is that, some of the marketing opportunities we see are in fact specifically enabled by our tech transformation. So therefore while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities and we really want to take advantage of those, we're leaning in and of course it takes investment to do that. So that's why I think revenue growth is I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really the key is having revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses of course. Thank you, Moshe. With our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how in many ways the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there is extra caution and you will remember Moshe, in the probably 18 months prior to this downturn maybe two years we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we're so long in the tooth on this economy and so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunity one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities one customer at a time. But collectively pulling up on this we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines and as we do that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get from originations which we're also leaning into. As you know it's a really interesting question, Moshe. Whether a downturn caused this rewards rates to go down or up. So the case for down in other words for people for the competition to get less intense about that is the people are pulling back, they're spending less and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they're about trying to grow quite a bit. Here's a flipside to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug of war and that is that what is most striking about the pullback probably true in any downturn, but especially in this one is how much of pullback there is been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders and I think that not just the point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on which is to travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others and those of the sectors that have been absolutely whacked  here. It's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well on a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending, travel opportunities and things like that don't necessarily work so enticing and certainly the case in this downturn. And so I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducement to generate the volumes that people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward levels and I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment even though paradoxically it's associated with so much pullback. Okay, Bob. We don't breakout our tech investment but Capital One I think relative to banks on our side invest quite a bit in technology then my sense is of what other banks our size invest in, by the way, our primary competitive set is the big national banks and they check  tech budgets, so we certainly know also what we're up against. But let me just talk about again so philosophically what we've done. I think what most banks - I think companies in general when they're looking everybody know they got to invest more in technology and even as recently this quarter so companies said they're increasing their technology spend and I almost can't image the companies not feeling the need to do that as they face and accelerating digital revolution. A thing that very common that companies do is, they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack. Meaning the things that are closest to the consumer investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or associates for things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements and there is no, it's a very natural thing to do. Capital One has taken the unlikely journey, a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at courses  and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this things bringing lots of thing in house, bringing a lot of engineering in house and it's been a journey that and you know this Bob and other investors on this call know that they would often say I know you're investing a lot, you're talking about it, but I can't see it because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see and this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock this journey that we're going through. What we so deeply believe that at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go, one really needs a modern tech stacks and that's a hard thing for startup bank to build. It's really hard thing for a legacy company to build and I think it was little easier for Capital One only that we were in a sense an original fintech three decades ago and so maybe don't have as much legacy as modest companies do. But it's still been a very significant journey. But I think when you say, how do we compare ourselves with other companies? I think other companies have I think there's a lot of good things other companies go are doing. They have really nice apps for their customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world and I think it was the little bit of shock to some folks when one day we said by the way we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud and that's the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of the and it's not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have in fact made that journey. Now where does - but what it puts in a position to do, is that is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like tech company and be able to be more dynamic faster to the market, create, offer better products, better customer experience and that give us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution and enables us to build our national bank and lean into that and enables us to win some partnerships that in head to head competition. I feel that we won by virtue of some of the tech capabilities we had and it enables to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on - well partly tech on tech cost like massive vendor cost that we can say. But at the same time we're investing a lot in tech so the big in that savings is not so much tech cost as it is the opportunity to reduce analog cost overtime. So that's kind of long answer to your question. But when we looked out and said overtime, we are going to want to do that or we're going to do  this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there. In each case we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do and we're well down that path. We're not done in many ways it's a lifelong journey but I think our opportunities are increasing as we get further down this path."

            "name": "Scott Blackley",
            "content": "Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year Capital One earned $2.7 billion or $5.18 per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were two small adjusting items which were outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $5.79. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year the investment gain was $535 million or around $0.89 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released $593 million of allowance primarily in our card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December. The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bills. In our allowance we continue to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to historic norm and we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID related uncertainty. In our commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for the specific reserves that were previously established for those loans. Rick, well thanks for your kind words and I appreciate both Rich and Jeff saying such nice things. It's been honestly just a privilege to be at this company and its certainly tough place to leave. But let me return to your question. In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies there's a big gap and I would just point out that, that is because right now our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes which gives sense, which is sensible given kind of the circumstance that we're in at the moment and so I think that the biggest driver where the allowance might go and what might drive releases is frankly just certainty and narrowing down the range of possible outcomes. I think could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccines, reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen overtime versus the step function so I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways overtime. Thanks for the question Bill. With respect to the share buyback program I think the most important thing I just want to underscore is that, the $7.5 billion that was authorized by the board really underscores our commitment to returning excess capital to the shareholders and I think that we're certainly excited to start that journey. As we think about capital deployment, the hierarchy there is first capital to growth opportunities and then share buybacks and dividends to follow and I would just point out in our past practice you can see that we manage share buybacks dynamically and we take into account market conditions, relative value, our holistic view on where we are in our capital position. In the first quarter we'll be limited $500 million I mentioned that based on the fed rules, after that the pacing of the share repurchase are really going to be guided by the factors I just talked about and by any regulatory guidelines that we might see. I'll just say that, we find our current valuation compelling and with over $8 billion of excess capital, we're really looking forward to getting started on the program. Betsy, why don't I take that one? So look I think that the - as I mentioned a couple times, I think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing all of the scenarios in thinking about that and that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk. And so even in the current quarter where you're right our 2021 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. During the full year we're expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago and so that coupled with we saw the passage at stimulus were both factors that drove the release this quarter. but we still have even with the positive trends we put on even more qualitative factors because it is just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out and we're in the allowance we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today and I really do believe that we will overtime see that in a play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize and if it doesn't normalize then we're going to have allowance releases and they're going to come in overtime. But until we start to see kind of more evidence that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios. Thanks Bob."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Capital One Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much Keith, and welcome everybody to Capital One's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log onto Capital One's Web site, capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2020 results.\nScott Blackley: Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on slide three of today's presentation where you can see Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.06 per diluted common share in the third quarter. Included in EPS for the quarter were three adjusting items which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share in the quarter was $5.05 per share. In addition to the adjusting items, we had a couple notable items in the quarter. We recorded a gain of $470 million or $0.79 per share related to an equity stake in Snowflake, which recently priced its initial public offering. We also recorded a $327 million or $0.54 per share allowance release associated with moving a partnership card portfolio to held-for-sale. Turning to slide four I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. Excluding the held-for-sale transfer, we released $390 million of allowance for the total company in the third quarter, mostly driven by a small balance sheet. In our allowance, we continue to assume no benefits from further government stimulus beyond any residual impacts of prior legislation in a correspondingly severe economic outlook with targeted qualitative factors for specific areas of uncertainty. We assume we end this year at a 9.7% unemployment rate, improving to around 8% by the end of 2021. Turning to slide five, you can see that allowance coverage levels were essentially flat as allowance releases were commensurate with contractions in our card and commercial loan portfolios. Our consumer banking coverage ratio declined modestly to 4% from 4.3%, mostly driven by a release in our auto finance allowance, which was driven by updated auction price assumptions.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Scott, and I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes results for our credit card business. Year-over-year, credit card loan balances, purchase volume, and revenue declined in the third quarter driven by the impacts of the pandemic. The biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly compared to both the prior year and linked quarters. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Consumer behavior was a key driver of domestic card results in the third quarter. In the current environment, consumers continue to behave cautiously spending less, saving more, and paying down debts. These behaviors are amplified by the cumulative effects of stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. We're seeing the effects of cautious consumer behavior across several key business\u2019 results, including pressure on spending and higher payments rates resulting in declining loan balances. But this cautious behavior is also a key driver of the most impactful domestic card headline in the quarter, strikingly strong credit results. We posted exceptional credit performance in the third quarter, especially in the context of the pandemic. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.64% a 48 basis point improvement year-over-year, and an 89 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.21%, a 150 basis points better than the prior year. The linked quarter improvement in the delinquency rate was 53 basis points, even though the typical seasonal pattern is a 50 - excuse me a 40 basis points increase. In addition to positive impacts from cautious consumers, stimulus, and widespread forbearance, our credit performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began, including our avoiding of high balance revolvers and caution on credit lines. Our own domestic card forbearance is not a significant driver of credit performance, because enrollment is low. We've provided updated information on domestic card forbearance on Appendix Slide 17. Purchase volume is rebounding from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Third quarter purchase volume was down just 1% from the prior year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 15% in the second quarter and about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic. By late September and through the first half of October, year-over-year purchase volume growth was modestly positive. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic.\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts you may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session has ended, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I guess I have a question on the net interest margin trajectory going forward, Scott. I know you talked about some contributors that caused the sequential degradation and the dependency for some items in the future. But looking ahead, if we assume a stable macro, could you maybe just dimensionalize some of the upside levers you have? I know there's a step up in the Walmart share, you have the funding costs coming through, the lower funding costs and lower liquidity potentially, could just talk about those, Scott?\nScott Blackley: Sure. Good afternoon, Sanjay. So, with respect to NIM, I think that the current margin is towards the low end of where I would expect to see NIM given our balance sheet mix. And if I just look at kind of the factors right now, cash is elevated, but deposit growth has slowed in Q3. In Q4, we're going to get the full quarter benefit of the deposit pricing actions that we took in Q3, and then auto growth is positive to NIM. So, I look at just those factors and there those are all positives. When you talk about longer term, more stimulus is the potential there is that that might drive more savings, which would be a headwind to NIM if we received more cash in the form of deposits. But, on the other hand, that's going to be a positive to our credit performance, and that seems like a good trade to make. So overall, at this point, feeling like we're towards the lows on NIM, and there are a number of factors that would go in a positive direction if everything in the economy kind of went stable from here forward.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. And I guess talking about the economy. Your reserve rates were stable as not sort of declined a tad. Could you just talk about how do you see that unfolding, assuming things don't change materially in the macro situation? And maybe, Rich, you could chime in on some of the things that you're worried about or not on the macro side because you mentioned credit quality looks strikingly strong. Thanks.\nScott Blackley: Why don't I start on the allowance and then Rich you can jump on the back end of that question? So when I look at the allowance, there's a couple important considerations. One is that we build our allowance to exclude the potentially positive effects of stimulus beyond what's already in place, and we've assumed some further worsening in the economy. Second, our delinquency inventories are at really, really low level, so we're starting at a place where, it's going to take a while for losses to actually manifest. So, I feel really comfortable with our coverage levels where they are today. And, if we just look at going forward, more stimulus could be a significant positive factor to allowance. And the economy is another wild card, if it worsens beyond our current assumptions and we didn't get stimulus in that case. In that case, we might be looking at the potential for reserve additions, but in an economy that goes kind of sideways or doesn't worsen much or if we get stimulus, I think there's some upside in the allowance.\nRichard Fairbank: Sanjay, just a comment about the consumer, this is the biggest disconnect that I certainly have experienced in my three decades of building Capital One, between what we see in the economy itself and the actual performance of the consumer, especially from a credit point of view. Now, some things that I think always happen in a downturn, and that is consumers tend to get more conservative, so they tend to pull back, spend less, save more. So in some ways, why would what we see here be any different from the past? And look, I still put a high degree of uncertainty around things, so I'm going to give you some views, but don't use this as like a prediction of what the consumer is going to do in the rest of this downturn. But I do think the consumer being in better shape going into this crisis starts kind of on the plus ledger for the consumer. Debt levels were lower, payment obligations lower still supported by the low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years was, I think, around double what it was before the great recession. And so, the consumer entered in a stronger situation. Then what happened is, unlike most other downturns, and certainly unlike the Great Recession, which took a lot of months to sort of build its momentum, this thing kind of came all of a sudden. And the world went into free fall, sort of as I often say, we all went down the elevator together at the same time; consumers did, companies did, and the government did. And so that I think the reaction by the consumers was more striking and more conservative than has happened in the past. So, they're spending less, saving more, paying down debt. And I think it's amplified relative to the past. Then overlay on top of this of course, that the swift and unprecedented government stimulus, and the widespread forbearance programs across the banking industry were both much greater and much swifter than occurred in the past. And so, the cumulative impact to consumer balance sheets of lower wages, offsetting government support and lower spending is -- some of these effects by their conservatism and some of the benefits that they were granted by external parties has added up to a positive net consumer sort of savings effect of over a $1 trillion or about $10,000 per household. And obviously, the impact across individual consumers and households is highly variable. But we now have the expiration of the expanded unemployment benefit, that's a blow to many millions of unemployed Americans. I think what we're dealing with is a cumulation of benefits that the consumer has had during this downturn, such that when suddenly the stimulus was kind of shut off, we didn't see our credit metrics suddenly skyrocket to work force places. I think the consumer is working through some of that cumulative that has built up, but I think that we still have to look at -- we're talking about electrifying economic numbers, awful lot of job losses, now a lot more of them being more permanent, and the government stimulus at this point not having been renewed, so I think it's just a matter of time before this thing could reverse itself in a significant way. And you see everything I say, I just want to say relative to a metaphor I've been using when I talk to investors is, every month that their favorable credit trends were sort of burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the huge economic worsening mountain such that even as potentially things revert to significantly worse place for the consumer, I think we've reduced the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact. So those are some thoughts Sanjay on what we're seeing. It's certainly not something collectively that I've observed before. But - and no one should look at this and feel, okay I give up. I'll speak for myself, we certainly - we feel really good about performance we're seeing, but we feel quite cautious about what could happen.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good evening.\nScott Blackley: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I wanted to dig in a little bit on the auto results. I know that you mentioned you have very strong auto results both on the loan side as well as on the credit side. First question here is just around the used car prices, they're clearly up a lot of about 15% year-on-year. And I guess just wanted to understand how much that piece of the equation impacted your net charge-off and your NIM around auto. And what you're assuming for used car prices going forward from here?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay, Betsy there's been unprecedented volatility in auction prices since the start of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, we saw a sudden collapse in auction prices as stay at home orders basically froze markets, and auction houses rushed to move online. By the end of the second quarter, we saw auction prices rebound to pre-COVID levels. And as the stay at home orders were lifted, consumer demand experienced sort of V shaped recovery in the auto space and supply remain constrained by leap delays and the decision of most lenders to suspend repossession. At the start of the third quarter, there was a massive amount of uncertainty around the stability of these trends, particularly whether consumer demand would remain strong with the expiration of stimulus and whether it would be enough to offset projected increases in supply. But as it turned out, through the third quarter, consumer demand remained incredibly strong, resulting in supply constraints that drove up auction prices as dealers struggled to maintain inventory levels. Over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the industry start to work through these supply constraints, with auction prices declining slightly, and dealer inventory starting to recover toward the pre-COVID levels. So going forward, we would expect auction prices to normalize over the next several months, as the industry fully works through these supply issues. We're underwriting to an assumption that they're going to be significantly adverse from there, just because of the - just to be cautious and because of the extreme volatility. To your question about how important was this in the results? It was one of the factors. So for example, in the credit results, there really were three auto - so why was auto credit so good beyond what we're seeing in cards that we've talked about? There are three auto specific effects. One is, our COVID loan extension programs having a more meaningful impact on our credit metrics than it is in card, because the program's got a more, bigger proportion of customers in it and because we extended relief to the impacted customers in later stage of delinquency. And then we've got the used car auction prices, which basically reached all-time highs in Q3. And we've also seen somewhat higher auto recoveries from the catch up from our temporary suspension of repossessions earlier in the downturn. So, it's definitely sort of a bunch of planets aligning in the auto space, driving performance that is extraordinary in some sense, and certainly on the credit side much of the things I talked about are more temporary in nature.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it, okay no, that's super helpful. Thanks for all that color Rich. The follow up question I have. Just have to do with what you're seeing with regard to the accounts that are exiting forbearance in the various products sets that you have? Some other folks, this earnings cycle have been suggesting that accounts exiting forbearance or exiting with a higher rate of delinquencies I'm wondering if you are seeing the same thing and could you put a number on what that difference is between accounts that were in forbearance and aren't? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah, so by the way, I would put - with let's say, you told me a downturn of any kind was coming. And we installed a forbearance program. I would with 100% confidence say, customers who enter a forbearance program and exited will have higher delinquencies than those who never did. Only because it's a, you take a population and you now create a filter, and this is an important filter, did you raise your hand and say, I'd like some of that forbearance? Is it versus one minus that group? It would be extremely rare for that group not to have higher delinquencies. Interestingly, probably the biggest driver of the delinquency number is it like what or what percentage of them are when they leave and that they stay current? So probably the biggest driver of that is how wide the funnel was in the first place, by which the company was inviting customers to come in and take the forbearance. The wider the funnel, the more likely regular, very low risk customers sort of took advantage of the program. So, in our business, let me just look this up here. If we look at the customers in our card business, we look at the customers who no longer enrolled, who are no longer enrolled, but were previously, 88% of them are current. In auto it is 86%. And the other thing, again, I just want to say I'm not sure how much information content there is in that only because one has filtered a population. The most telling thing would be the overall delinquencies that you see on our portfolio because all these customers who have entered forbearance are basically part of the delinquency metrics that you observe.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Good evening, guys.\nRichard Fairbank: Hi Nash.\nRyan Nash: Rich, you noted that we could see a significant ramp in marketing in 4Q. Can you maybe just clarify what the expectations are in terms of the quarter-over-quarter increase? And second, just more broadly speaking, when competition is historically pulled back, you've used it as an opportunity when you've seen a window to accelerate growth. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about your approach to increasing marketing spend at this point. And are things still too uncertain for you to do that? Do you have any sort of visibility at this point? Or is it more just seasonal in nature, and we should expect it to remain low as another issue or talked about this morning? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So this our saying that marketing to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third is not a declaration that we see all the light at the end of the tunnel, we're all in, you're right at Capital One we sometimes dig while others dig. We also sometimes dig while others dig, and it's all a situational kind of thing. The primary, the reason that we're kind of leaning into this marketing guidance relative to the next quarter is more just how low it is now, not to look at that and say that, at that low level, it's going to sustain itself. So, let me just give you a little more context here. We pulled back in certain channels early in the crisis in response to the decrease opportunity for quality growth. And just given the unprecedented uncertainty early on, we've since re-entered most channels. And it's interesting, while marketing was flat overall in the company, within card marketing increased through the quarter. Again, it was mostly just coming off such a very low level. And so, what we are saying is you have the seasonal ramp that always happens in the fourth quarter as Capital One. And then on top of that, because even though our marketing was flat within the quarter company wide, within card it was quite slow. And so we're really saying just the full seasonal - the full quarter effect and that will also pull the numbers of fair amount higher. So, it's really more a pulling-up from weight being so low as opposed to a statement of a big transformation and how much marketing and growth we're going after here.\nRyan Nash: But in your prepared remarks, you talked about capital return being an important part of the picture for shareholders. When we look to capital ratios are at 13 and once we get through the next few quarters should be at least 13.5% or over 20% of your market cap in excess. Now, I know we still have a handful of things that we need to get through. The Fed stress test, but it seems like if we had the minimum from the SCB of 10.1 and your internal target of 11, it seems like you have the potential to get pretty aggressive on returning capital. So if you maybe just talk about the capital priorities, and how quickly do you think you can manage the capital down once we have clarity on where the economy is headed? Thanks.\nScott Blackley: Yes, thanks Ryan. Well, as you know all the large banks are going through CCAR 2.0 right now, and as I mentioned, we're going to get through that process and get our feedback before we make any adjustments to our capital situation. I think that as we talked about with stress capital buffer, with the buffer for us under that framework, where the total capital required under that framework is 10.1, we want to operate in most environments with a buffer above that, so, probably over 11%. I think that what I'm hoping is that we'll start to see the Fed move away from the current level of restrictions, and that in the first quarter, they will migrate to the stress capital buffer framework, which should allow us to manage our capital distributions both dividends and share repurchases on a much more dynamic basis. And as we talked about and we mentioned in our comments, we do appreciate that this is an important component of shareholder return. And so, we're looking to get back into the business of having an appropriate amount of capital and making sure the shareholders are receiving distributions.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. Rich, you in response to Sanjay's question touched on something that I think is really interesting. You mentioned divergence between labor markets and credit markets and credit performance. And you hypothesized whether or not what we've seen is a delay in credit events, or we're actually going to see moderation from all of the policy initiatives. And you alluded to the fact that you think it's the latter. I want to make - I want to understand, in part, what drives that view? And then I want to turn the question to Scott and ask, where's the reserve or the allowance in that context? Are you still more reserved in the delay scenario at this point?\nRichard Fairbank: Hey Rick, I want to make sure that I articulate for a second your two circulate for a second, your two scenarios, the delay scenario describe what you're saying that is. That would be, it's going to get as bad as ever. It's just delayed in getting there. And the moderation\u2026\nRick Shane: Got it.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. So yeah, I'll let Scott talk about the allowance just sort of is, there have been - well, certainly right now, there is a divergence between the two is extraordinary. I do think that - and the most common thing everybody's talking about is government stimulus. And I believe that is an important effect. I wouldn't underestimate the collective impact of forbearance across the banking industry as well and again to some extent in rents and other things. But between the strength because the consumer entered the downturn and the various things that are providing some relief, it is clearly disconnecting the relationship that we would otherwise see between unemployment and the consumer's financial health and credit performance. So, I think it is very plausible that this sort of bank account if you will of cumulatively some good things that the consumer has had available is something that is finite and very plausibly can't last for an extended period of time. I think it still buffers for a short period of time, but if we don't see stimulus, and if the economy continues to really be hurting. I have trouble envisioning how the consumer doesn't end up getting in a worse place from here. But I did - my points are I think that timing of that can still be buffered by the accumulated benefits. And then my other point is that I think burrowing through the tunnel, I picture a big mountain which is the bad economy and going up and then going down on the other side. Burrowing through the tunnel and even then, if the consumer has to rejoin that bad mountain, if you will, it's a strange metaphor. I think that some of the worst aspects of that downturn will have been averted by virtue of every month that passes. What I want to do is give it to Scott to comment on how we've handled the allowance.\nScott Blackley: Yeah, thanks, Rich. Rick, so if you think about what we have to do in the allowance, we're starting with delinquency levels that are not connected to the level of unemployment that we're seeing. And so one of the things that we have to do in the allowances is to take those delinquency levels and over time, kind of get them to link up with unemployment levels. One of the reasons that we are thinking that's happening is that some of the stimulus actually comes in, in a form where it's replacing income. And so even though you've got elevated level of unemployment, you basically are you have a consumer who's, who may be unemployed, counting in the unemployed, calculations, but it's receiving benefits that allowing them to stay current as if they were fully employed. So as we start to see stimulus unfold here, the real question that we face in the allowance is just how long is that income replacement going to continue? And what does that mean to the total loss content? So those are the kinds of issues that we would face with the allowance?\nRick Shane: Got it. That's very helpful and Rich, I do appreciate the metaphor as well. Thank you, guys.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolf Research.\nBill Carcache: Thanks, good evening. Rich, can you discuss the competitive landscape as you think about the potential threats on one hand from the neo-bank sort of the times of the world that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of post COVID environment? And on the other hand, the Buy now pay later is like the corners and after pays. How do you see their presence impacting the competitive environment in the card business, say, over the next two to five years? And is there any potential benefit to deploying some of your excess capital into M&A and one of those areas or those sort of capabilities, things that you think you can build on their own?\nRichard Fairbank: So well, Bill, it's certainly quite fascinating and striking to see what's happening on both the banking side and the lending side with respect to these new competitors. Let me talk about the Buy now pay later phenomenon. There has been a point of sale lending forever basically. And it's always been there as another form of financing. And it's interesting in many ways the credit card became the disrupter in point of sale lending. I never forget when early on in the Capital One journey, I ran into this guy who said, you ruined my business. I'm so sorry. How did we ruin your business? And he said, I ran a furniture store. I made my money on financing and the credit card has kind of put me out of business. And so the credit card has been an incredible efficient tool in a world where point of sale financing has continued. And there's logical reasons they both would coexist. I think it's really striking what has happened recently, with respect to the Buy now pay later, which there's a couple of striking things going on that are not, haven't been a part of the historical context. One is just the technology, the ease of the whole thing. And with a single click, you can kind of Buy now pay later that has been one aspect of this. And the other is that, merchants are paying the lenders at this point the way the marketplace works. Merchants paying the lenders which has allowed this to be a pretty financially attractive business for some of these neo-players and has helped keep that industry unassailable. A lot of times you have to race to the bottom in terms of how high the short-term pricing gets etcetera. So, this is something that's growing rapidly. And I think that it's something that we are looking carefully at and watching and trying to assess where that market is going. We wonder how sustainable the revenue model of that is, with respect to the merchant subsidies in a more competitive marketplace. So, we'll have to keep an eye on that. But I think, this is another example of how digital technology and the real time instant solutions is where the entire world is going. The history of banking is to deliver solutions on a batch basis to consumers. And I think this is another example of how real time solutions are here. And all banks, if they don't increasingly figure out how to leverage data in real time and bring instant customized solutions to consumers may find themselves in a bad place. Then you got the whole banking side of the marketplace, the chimes, and some of the other players that I think has also have created a disruptive model. We tend to root for their success, because we are also a disruptor in this marketplace. And the more collectively all of us can get at the - make progress against the highly inertial entrenched behavior of Americans to always bank with their branch bank. The more we can chip away collectively with that, I think the more opportunity there is for all of us digital players, Capital One included, but we're certainly inspired by some of the things that we see by some of the neo-banks.\nBill Carcache: That's super helpful, Rich, thank you. If I can squeeze in another quick one on auto, can you discuss how your mix of new versus used originations has evolved? And whether there's any particular area that you've been leaning into more heavily?\nRichard Fairbank: There's not - well, there's been a lot of used, of course, just some of the market conditions that have led to a lot of used car buying. So, I don't have in front of me data with respect to that, but the used car opportunity is a sweet spot for most banks, because the captive lenders can do subsidize their new car purchases. So, the majority of our entire business is used, and the more the used car market thrives the better it is for Capital One. I think the bigger effect that's going on that we're struck by, in addition to just have all that sort of the tide of auto has risen for all the boats, for all the players, and it's just a kind of a strikingly sort of good time in the industry and technically, we should all know in the middle of the master pandemic, so we got to be very careful. But kind of little captive, the traction that we're seeing with our digital strategy is particularly we're seeing in auto, because of the very physical nature of how the product is brought. And this is an example of where the pandemic is accelerating things that would happen anyway. But in the auto space, the more they accelerate the sort of direct side not necessarily the pure direct where no one ever goes to a dealership, but the semi-direct or the hybrid direct and thing that just involves faster, more digital solutions. That plays into the hand of Capital One because we've invested four years in real time, automated solutions and being able to underwrite any car in America on any lot in less than a second, and to be able to provide that information to consumers before they go into a dealership and also lessen the amount of hard work and waiting once you get it.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Well Rich, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio and also given the stress, are there any opportunistic opportunities that you see coming to market?\nRichard Fairbank: So, our commercial real estate is $30 billion across a range of property types. Relative to most banks, their overall portfolio is more concentrated in multifamily, which we view as more resilient while it's underweight in more volatile sectors like hotel, retail, office and construction. So in the multifamily space, we have $18 billion in exposure in multifamily. About $13 billion is on balance sheet and about $5 billion in agency low share. And of that, of the $13 billion we have on balance sheet, about half of our exposures in the New York metropolitan area. And, as you know Don, there are real borrower challenges in the market with low rent collections and addiction moratoriums. So, our focus and the significant majority of our portfolio is in rent regulated in Class B properties which have been historically more resilient in recessions. So the big increase in credit sized performing loans was in the multifamily portfolio. We feel really good about the LTV, the low LTVs that we have backing this book. But it certainly has our attention that New York's got a number of challenges on the real estate side. And so, we'll very carefully monitor how this plays out. But we feel collectively very good about our overall real estate portfolio and the choices that drove us to where we are.\nDon Fandetti: Okay, thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Hey, thanks. Richard, with the front end of the questions you talked a little bit about some of the differences between this and the Great Recession. I guess another one would be the banks and card issuers themselves are actually in a better position than they were at that point. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think that impacts the competitive opportunity and what you're willing to talk about, what Cap One's plans are with respect to that?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. It's a really insightful comment that you make Moshe because, one of the things that we know that happened in the Great Recession is the consumer was more levered up. But you also had in the banking industry, both banks and non-banks were not providing products that were not nearly as well underwritten. That often had complicated features with them, and there was just a lot of disequilibrium to sort out. And that really compounded the consumers journey through the downturn that their own condition and also working through some of the things the most extreme, of course, motion was the mortgage products and all the issues there. So, and what happened is a lot of the bad lending practices, I say bad from a credit risk point of view, and also certain consumer practices got driven out in the Great Recession. And on the other side of it was a very rational, high performing credit card marketplace. And I've said for years on the other side of the Great Recession, I think this is a strikingly rational marketplace. I find it more rational than the other lending marketplaces in which we compete. And each of the players there sort of has carved out a particular niche in there, they're doing well. So I see Moshe a very rational behavior, even right now in the pandemic. Fortunately everybody pulled back. But first of all, you start with card players have something happening to them that basically is pretty unique across lending products. And that is that our portfolios are shrinking pretty dramatically. Here commercial in general, people drawing out online increased the volumes. So, I think that we card players are struck by, Oh, my goodness, just with the less spending and all this conservative behavior by consumers, we've been going backwards pretty rapidly, pretty much all of us have. And but I think that, that is the flip side of what comes from the strikingly sound and conservative behavior of our consumers. So, where did the industry go for from here? I think the industry has pulled back. And I think all of us, in our own way, are trying to figure out, no one's going to fully step on the back gas, no one is all the way pulled back. And I think for everyone, it is how to find the selective opportunity, where you can continue to lean into this thing and book business and it's going to be resilient, even if things get a whole lot worse. And some of them have tried true strategies motion we've had for many years, our conservatism on credit lines, the avoidances, high balance revolvers, and so on. Our strategy has been so resilience focus, I think that, for us the opportunity to continue to book accounts be very conservative on credit lines, build up the potential energies but continue to be being careful on credit lines, book to protect, grow the potential energy and delay the release to some extent into a kinetic energy to a lot of live growth until we see more clarity on where this economy is going. So, that's how we're continuing to lean in, even in the context of this for the electrifying economy.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks, Richard. And maybe a follow-up question for Scott. I noticed that revenue suppression had improved fairly significantly. I guess that works relative to actual delinquencies and maybe could you talk a little bit about how that's going to look going forward?\nScott Blackley: Yes, you're right. The suppression is a shorter coverage period than allowance. It really only goes through the point of charge-off and when you've got a low delinquencies, that's improved. So, as long as we see stability in our delinquency levels, that would stay at about the levels where it is now. We started to see them. Delinquencies worsened, that would increase the amount of suppression.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our final question this evening will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBrian Foran: Hi. Pretty much everything has been asked, like it's a done marketing. So I guess the normal seasonal increase would be maybe $100 million, $150 million, maybe $150 million, $175 million actually. A normal level would be maybe more of $500 million or $600 million. So are there any - I know you're not going to give a point estimate, but are there any guardrails which you could give maybe that we think is more like a normal seasonal increase to below $400 million so we thinking more like a normal seasonal level to the mid 500 millions in terms of gotten something depend fully on marketing for the fourth quarter?\nScott Blackley: Brian, we're probably going to leave our guidance where it is, but the main thing we wanted people to just know that it's been unusually low at this point and don't get too used to the unusually low level. And so that's why it's the double effect that we're calling for the double effect of the normal significant seasonal increase that we have in the fourth quarter around things like our sponsorships and a lot of things that happened late in the year, as well as the continuation of what happened late in the quarter looking at the marketing levels and card. A phenomenon that was not visible in the aggregated credit numbers because it just turned out by coincidence, some of the marketing elsewhere in the company around retail, which had really been sort of higher right out of the gate with all the deposit inflows that we've had, we pulled back somewhat on the retail.\nBrian Foran: Fair enough. Looking then to forbearance in 2009 when you did you load market and that got into a normalized earnings model. So fair to remind people that you still .\nRichard Fairbank: Okay, well, Brian, thank you.\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Brian, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on tonight's conference call. Thank you for your interest in Capital One. And remember the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes results for our credit card business. Year-over-year, credit card loan balances, purchase volume, and revenue declined in the third quarter driven by the impacts of the pandemic. The biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly compared to both the prior year and linked quarters. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Consumer behavior was a key driver of domestic card results in the third quarter. In the current environment, consumers continue to behave cautiously spending less, saving more, and paying down debts. These behaviors are amplified by the cumulative effects of stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. We're seeing the effects of cautious consumer behavior across several key business' results, including pressure on spending and higher payments rates resulting in declining loan balances. But this cautious behavior is also a key driver of the most impactful domestic card headline in the quarter, strikingly strong credit results. We posted exceptional credit performance in the third quarter, especially in the context of the pandemic. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.64% a 48 basis point improvement year-over-year, and an 89 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.21%, a 150 basis points better than the prior year. The linked quarter improvement in the delinquency rate was 53 basis points, even though the typical seasonal pattern is a 50 - excuse me a 40 basis points increase. In addition to positive impacts from cautious consumers, stimulus, and widespread forbearance, our credit performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began, including our avoiding of high balance revolvers and caution on credit lines. Our own domestic card forbearance is not a significant driver of credit performance, because enrollment is low. We've provided updated information on domestic card forbearance on Appendix Slide 17. Purchase volume is rebounding from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Third quarter purchase volume was down just 1% from the prior year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 15% in the second quarter and about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic. By late September and through the first half of October, year-over-year purchase volume growth was modestly positive. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic. Sanjay, just a comment about the consumer, this is the biggest disconnect that I certainly have experienced in my three decades of building Capital One, between what we see in the economy itself and the actual performance of the consumer, especially from a credit point of view. Now, some things that I think always happen in a downturn, and that is consumers tend to get more conservative, so they tend to pull back, spend less, save more. So in some ways, why would what we see here be any different from the past? And look, I still put a high degree of uncertainty around things, so I'm going to give you some views, but don't use this as like a prediction of what the consumer is going to do in the rest of this downturn. But I do think the consumer being in better shape going into this crisis starts kind of on the plus ledger for the consumer. Debt levels were lower, payment obligations lower still supported by the low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years was, I think, around double what it was before the great recession. And so, the consumer entered in a stronger situation. Then what happened is, unlike most other downturns, and certainly unlike the Great Recession, which took a lot of months to sort of build its momentum, this thing kind of came all of a sudden. And the world went into free fall, sort of as I often say, we all went down the elevator together at the same time; consumers did, companies did, and the government did. And so that I think the reaction by the consumers was more striking and more conservative than has happened in the past. So, they're spending less, saving more, paying down debt. And I think it's amplified relative to the past. Then overlay on top of this of course, that the swift and unprecedented government stimulus, and the widespread forbearance programs across the banking industry were both much greater and much swifter than occurred in the past. And so, the cumulative impact to consumer balance sheets of lower wages, offsetting government support and lower spending is -- some of these effects by their conservatism and some of the benefits that they were granted by external parties has added up to a positive net consumer sort of savings effect of over a $1 trillion or about $10,000 per household. And obviously, the impact across individual consumers and households is highly variable. But we now have the expiration of the expanded unemployment benefit, that's a blow to many millions of unemployed Americans. I think what we're dealing with is a cumulation of benefits that the consumer has had during this downturn, such that when suddenly the stimulus was kind of shut off, we didn't see our credit metrics suddenly skyrocket to work force places. I think the consumer is working through some of that cumulative that has built up, but I think that we still have to look at -- we're talking about electrifying economic numbers, awful lot of job losses, now a lot more of them being more permanent, and the government stimulus at this point not having been renewed, so I think it's just a matter of time before this thing could reverse itself in a significant way. And you see everything I say, I just want to say relative to a metaphor I've been using when I talk to investors is, every month that their favorable credit trends were sort of burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the huge economic worsening mountain such that even as potentially things revert to significantly worse place for the consumer, I think we've reduced the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact. So those are some thoughts Sanjay on what we're seeing. It's certainly not something collectively that I've observed before. But - and no one should look at this and feel, okay I give up. I'll speak for myself, we certainly - we feel really good about performance we're seeing, but we feel quite cautious about what could happen. Okay, Betsy there's been unprecedented volatility in auction prices since the start of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, we saw a sudden collapse in auction prices as stay at home orders basically froze markets, and auction houses rushed to move online. By the end of the second quarter, we saw auction prices rebound to pre-COVID levels. And as the stay at home orders were lifted, consumer demand experienced sort of V shaped recovery in the auto space and supply remain constrained by leap delays and the decision of most lenders to suspend repossession. At the start of the third quarter, there was a massive amount of uncertainty around the stability of these trends, particularly whether consumer demand would remain strong with the expiration of stimulus and whether it would be enough to offset projected increases in supply. But as it turned out, through the third quarter, consumer demand remained incredibly strong, resulting in supply constraints that drove up auction prices as dealers struggled to maintain inventory levels. Over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the industry start to work through these supply constraints, with auction prices declining slightly, and dealer inventory starting to recover toward the pre-COVID levels. So going forward, we would expect auction prices to normalize over the next several months, as the industry fully works through these supply issues. We're underwriting to an assumption that they're going to be significantly adverse from there, just because of the - just to be cautious and because of the extreme volatility. To your question about how important was this in the results? It was one of the factors. So for example, in the credit results, there really were three auto - so why was auto credit so good beyond what we're seeing in cards that we've talked about? There are three auto specific effects. One is, our COVID loan extension programs having a more meaningful impact on our credit metrics than it is in card, because the program's got a more, bigger proportion of customers in it and because we extended relief to the impacted customers in later stage of delinquency. And then we've got the used car auction prices, which basically reached all-time highs in Q3. And we've also seen somewhat higher auto recoveries from the catch up from our temporary suspension of repossessions earlier in the downturn. So, it's definitely sort of a bunch of planets aligning in the auto space, driving performance that is extraordinary in some sense, and certainly on the credit side much of the things I talked about are more temporary in nature. Yeah, so by the way, I would put - with let's say, you told me a downturn of any kind was coming. And we installed a forbearance program. I would with 100% confidence say, customers who enter a forbearance program and exited will have higher delinquencies than those who never did. Only because it's a, you take a population and you now create a filter, and this is an important filter, did you raise your hand and say, I'd like some of that forbearance? Is it versus one minus that group? It would be extremely rare for that group not to have higher delinquencies. Interestingly, probably the biggest driver of the delinquency number is it like what or what percentage of them are when they leave and that they stay current? So probably the biggest driver of that is how wide the funnel was in the first place, by which the company was inviting customers to come in and take the forbearance. The wider the funnel, the more likely regular, very low risk customers sort of took advantage of the program. So, in our business, let me just look this up here. If we look at the customers in our card business, we look at the customers who no longer enrolled, who are no longer enrolled, but were previously, 88% of them are current. In auto it is 86%. And the other thing, again, I just want to say I'm not sure how much information content there is in that only because one has filtered a population. The most telling thing would be the overall delinquencies that you see on our portfolio because all these customers who have entered forbearance are basically part of the delinquency metrics that you observe. Hi Nash. Yes. So this our saying that marketing to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third is not a declaration that we see all the light at the end of the tunnel, we're all in, you're right at Capital One we sometimes dig while others dig. We also sometimes dig while others dig, and it's all a situational kind of thing. The primary, the reason that we're kind of leaning into this marketing guidance relative to the next quarter is more just how low it is now, not to look at that and say that, at that low level, it's going to sustain itself. So, let me just give you a little more context here. We pulled back in certain channels early in the crisis in response to the decrease opportunity for quality growth. And just given the unprecedented uncertainty early on, we've since re-entered most channels. And it's interesting, while marketing was flat overall in the company, within card marketing increased through the quarter. Again, it was mostly just coming off such a very low level. And so, what we are saying is you have the seasonal ramp that always happens in the fourth quarter as Capital One. And then on top of that, because even though our marketing was flat within the quarter company wide, within card it was quite slow. And so we're really saying just the full seasonal - the full quarter effect and that will also pull the numbers of fair amount higher. So, it's really more a pulling-up from weight being so low as opposed to a statement of a big transformation and how much marketing and growth we're going after here. Hey Rick, I want to make sure that I articulate for a second your two circulate for a second, your two scenarios, the delay scenario describe what you're saying that is. That would be, it's going to get as bad as ever. It's just delayed in getting there. And the moderation... Yeah. So yeah, I'll let Scott talk about the allowance just sort of is, there have been - well, certainly right now, there is a divergence between the two is extraordinary. I do think that - and the most common thing everybody's talking about is government stimulus. And I believe that is an important effect. I wouldn't underestimate the collective impact of forbearance across the banking industry as well and again to some extent in rents and other things. But between the strength because the consumer entered the downturn and the various things that are providing some relief, it is clearly disconnecting the relationship that we would otherwise see between unemployment and the consumer's financial health and credit performance. So, I think it is very plausible that this sort of bank account if you will of cumulatively some good things that the consumer has had available is something that is finite and very plausibly can't last for an extended period of time. I think it still buffers for a short period of time, but if we don't see stimulus, and if the economy continues to really be hurting. I have trouble envisioning how the consumer doesn't end up getting in a worse place from here. But I did - my points are I think that timing of that can still be buffered by the accumulated benefits. And then my other point is that I think burrowing through the tunnel, I picture a big mountain which is the bad economy and going up and then going down on the other side. Burrowing through the tunnel and even then, if the consumer has to rejoin that bad mountain, if you will, it's a strange metaphor. I think that some of the worst aspects of that downturn will have been averted by virtue of every month that passes. What I want to do is give it to Scott to comment on how we've handled the allowance. So well, Bill, it's certainly quite fascinating and striking to see what's happening on both the banking side and the lending side with respect to these new competitors. Let me talk about the Buy now pay later phenomenon. There has been a point of sale lending forever basically. And it's always been there as another form of financing. And it's interesting in many ways the credit card became the disrupter in point of sale lending. I never forget when early on in the Capital One journey, I ran into this guy who said, you ruined my business. I'm so sorry. How did we ruin your business? And he said, I ran a furniture store. I made my money on financing and the credit card has kind of put me out of business. And so the credit card has been an incredible efficient tool in a world where point of sale financing has continued. And there's logical reasons they both would coexist. I think it's really striking what has happened recently, with respect to the Buy now pay later, which there's a couple of striking things going on that are not, haven't been a part of the historical context. One is just the technology, the ease of the whole thing. And with a single click, you can kind of Buy now pay later that has been one aspect of this. And the other is that, merchants are paying the lenders at this point the way the marketplace works. Merchants paying the lenders which has allowed this to be a pretty financially attractive business for some of these neo-players and has helped keep that industry unassailable. A lot of times you have to race to the bottom in terms of how high the short-term pricing gets etcetera. So, this is something that's growing rapidly. And I think that it's something that we are looking carefully at and watching and trying to assess where that market is going. We wonder how sustainable the revenue model of that is, with respect to the merchant subsidies in a more competitive marketplace. So, we'll have to keep an eye on that. But I think, this is another example of how digital technology and the real time instant solutions is where the entire world is going. The history of banking is to deliver solutions on a batch basis to consumers. And I think this is another example of how real time solutions are here. And all banks, if they don't increasingly figure out how to leverage data in real time and bring instant customized solutions to consumers may find themselves in a bad place. Then you got the whole banking side of the marketplace, the chimes, and some of the other players that I think has also have created a disruptive model. We tend to root for their success, because we are also a disruptor in this marketplace. And the more collectively all of us can get at the - make progress against the highly inertial entrenched behavior of Americans to always bank with their branch bank. The more we can chip away collectively with that, I think the more opportunity there is for all of us digital players, Capital One included, but we're certainly inspired by some of the things that we see by some of the neo-banks. There's not - well, there's been a lot of used, of course, just some of the market conditions that have led to a lot of used car buying. So, I don't have in front of me data with respect to that, but the used car opportunity is a sweet spot for most banks, because the captive lenders can do subsidize their new car purchases. So, the majority of our entire business is used, and the more the used car market thrives the better it is for Capital One. I think the bigger effect that's going on that we're struck by, in addition to just have all that sort of the tide of auto has risen for all the boats, for all the players, and it's just a kind of a strikingly sort of good time in the industry and technically, we should all know in the middle of the master pandemic, so we got to be very careful. But kind of little captive, the traction that we're seeing with our digital strategy is particularly we're seeing in auto, because of the very physical nature of how the product is brought. And this is an example of where the pandemic is accelerating things that would happen anyway. But in the auto space, the more they accelerate the sort of direct side not necessarily the pure direct where no one ever goes to a dealership, but the semi-direct or the hybrid direct and thing that just involves faster, more digital solutions. That plays into the hand of Capital One because we've invested four years in real time, automated solutions and being able to underwrite any car in America on any lot in less than a second, and to be able to provide that information to consumers before they go into a dealership and also lessen the amount of hard work and waiting once you get it. So, our commercial real estate is $30 billion across a range of property types. Relative to most banks, their overall portfolio is more concentrated in multifamily, which we view as more resilient while it's underweight in more volatile sectors like hotel, retail, office and construction. So in the multifamily space, we have $18 billion in exposure in multifamily. About $13 billion is on balance sheet and about $5 billion in agency low share. And of that, of the $13 billion we have on balance sheet, about half of our exposures in the New York metropolitan area. And, as you know Don, there are real borrower challenges in the market with low rent collections and addiction moratoriums. So, our focus and the significant majority of our portfolio is in rent regulated in Class B properties which have been historically more resilient in recessions. So the big increase in credit sized performing loans was in the multifamily portfolio. We feel really good about the LTV, the low LTVs that we have backing this book. But it certainly has our attention that New York's got a number of challenges on the real estate side. And so, we'll very carefully monitor how this plays out. But we feel collectively very good about our overall real estate portfolio and the choices that drove us to where we are. Yeah. It's a really insightful comment that you make Moshe because, one of the things that we know that happened in the Great Recession is the consumer was more levered up. But you also had in the banking industry, both banks and non-banks were not providing products that were not nearly as well underwritten. That often had complicated features with them, and there was just a lot of disequilibrium to sort out. And that really compounded the consumers journey through the downturn that their own condition and also working through some of the things the most extreme, of course, motion was the mortgage products and all the issues there. So, and what happened is a lot of the bad lending practices, I say bad from a credit risk point of view, and also certain consumer practices got driven out in the Great Recession. And on the other side of it was a very rational, high performing credit card marketplace. And I've said for years on the other side of the Great Recession, I think this is a strikingly rational marketplace. I find it more rational than the other lending marketplaces in which we compete. And each of the players there sort of has carved out a particular niche in there, they're doing well. So I see Moshe a very rational behavior, even right now in the pandemic. Fortunately everybody pulled back. But first of all, you start with card players have something happening to them that basically is pretty unique across lending products. And that is that our portfolios are shrinking pretty dramatically. Here commercial in general, people drawing out online increased the volumes. So, I think that we card players are struck by, Oh, my goodness, just with the less spending and all this conservative behavior by consumers, we've been going backwards pretty rapidly, pretty much all of us have. And but I think that, that is the flip side of what comes from the strikingly sound and conservative behavior of our consumers. So, where did the industry go for from here? I think the industry has pulled back. And I think all of us, in our own way, are trying to figure out, no one's going to fully step on the back gas, no one is all the way pulled back. And I think for everyone, it is how to find the selective opportunity, where you can continue to lean into this thing and book business and it's going to be resilient, even if things get a whole lot worse. And some of them have tried true strategies motion we've had for many years, our conservatism on credit lines, the avoidances, high balance revolvers, and so on. Our strategy has been so resilience focus, I think that, for us the opportunity to continue to book accounts be very conservative on credit lines, build up the potential energies but continue to be being careful on credit lines, book to protect, grow the potential energy and delay the release to some extent into a kinetic energy to a lot of live growth until we see more clarity on where this economy is going. So, that's how we're continuing to lean in, even in the context of this for the electrifying economy. Okay, well, Brian, thank you. Thank you all."

            "name": "Scott Blackley",
            "content": "Thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. I'll start on slide three of today's presentation where you can see Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.06 per diluted common share in the third quarter. Included in EPS for the quarter were three adjusting items which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share in the quarter was $5.05 per share. In addition to the adjusting items, we had a couple notable items in the quarter. We recorded a gain of $470 million or $0.79 per share related to an equity stake in Snowflake, which recently priced its initial public offering. We also recorded a $327 million or $0.54 per share allowance release associated with moving a partnership card portfolio to held-for-sale. Turning to slide four I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. Excluding the held-for-sale transfer, we released $390 million of allowance for the total company in the third quarter, mostly driven by a small balance sheet. In our allowance, we continue to assume no benefits from further government stimulus beyond any residual impacts of prior legislation in a correspondingly severe economic outlook with targeted qualitative factors for specific areas of uncertainty. We assume we end this year at a 9.7% unemployment rate, improving to around 8% by the end of 2021. Turning to slide five, you can see that allowance coverage levels were essentially flat as allowance releases were commensurate with contractions in our card and commercial loan portfolios. Our consumer banking coverage ratio declined modestly to 4% from 4.3%, mostly driven by a release in our auto finance allowance, which was driven by updated auction price assumptions. Sure. Good afternoon, Sanjay. So, with respect to NIM, I think that the current margin is towards the low end of where I would expect to see NIM given our balance sheet mix. And if I just look at kind of the factors right now, cash is elevated, but deposit growth has slowed in Q3. In Q4, we're going to get the full quarter benefit of the deposit pricing actions that we took in Q3, and then auto growth is positive to NIM. So, I look at just those factors and there those are all positives. When you talk about longer term, more stimulus is the potential there is that that might drive more savings, which would be a headwind to NIM if we received more cash in the form of deposits. But, on the other hand, that's going to be a positive to our credit performance, and that seems like a good trade to make. So overall, at this point, feeling like we're towards the lows on NIM, and there are a number of factors that would go in a positive direction if everything in the economy kind of went stable from here forward. Why don't I start on the allowance and then Rich you can jump on the back end of that question? So when I look at the allowance, there's a couple important considerations. One is that we build our allowance to exclude the potentially positive effects of stimulus beyond what's already in place, and we've assumed some further worsening in the economy. Second, our delinquency inventories are at really, really low level, so we're starting at a place where, it's going to take a while for losses to actually manifest. So, I feel really comfortable with our coverage levels where they are today. And, if we just look at going forward, more stimulus could be a significant positive factor to allowance. And the economy is another wild card, if it worsens beyond our current assumptions and we didn't get stimulus in that case. In that case, we might be looking at the potential for reserve additions, but in an economy that goes kind of sideways or doesn't worsen much or if we get stimulus, I think there's some upside in the allowance. Hi, Betsy. Yes, thanks Ryan. Well, as you know all the large banks are going through CCAR 2.0 right now, and as I mentioned, we're going to get through that process and get our feedback before we make any adjustments to our capital situation. I think that as we talked about with stress capital buffer, with the buffer for us under that framework, where the total capital required under that framework is 10.1, we want to operate in most environments with a buffer above that, so, probably over 11%. I think that what I'm hoping is that we'll start to see the Fed move away from the current level of restrictions, and that in the first quarter, they will migrate to the stress capital buffer framework, which should allow us to manage our capital distributions both dividends and share repurchases on a much more dynamic basis. And as we talked about and we mentioned in our comments, we do appreciate that this is an important component of shareholder return. And so, we're looking to get back into the business of having an appropriate amount of capital and making sure the shareholders are receiving distributions. Yeah, thanks, Rich. Rick, so if you think about what we have to do in the allowance, we're starting with delinquency levels that are not connected to the level of unemployment that we're seeing. And so one of the things that we have to do in the allowances is to take those delinquency levels and over time, kind of get them to link up with unemployment levels. One of the reasons that we are thinking that's happening is that some of the stimulus actually comes in, in a form where it's replacing income. And so even though you've got elevated level of unemployment, you basically are you have a consumer who's, who may be unemployed, counting in the unemployed, calculations, but it's receiving benefits that allowing them to stay current as if they were fully employed. So as we start to see stimulus unfold here, the real question that we face in the allowance is just how long is that income replacement going to continue? And what does that mean to the total loss content? So those are the kinds of issues that we would face with the allowance? Yes, you're right. The suppression is a shorter coverage period than allowance. It really only goes through the point of charge-off and when you've got a low delinquencies, that's improved. So, as long as we see stability in our delinquency levels, that would stay at about the levels where it is now. We started to see them. Delinquencies worsened, that would increase the amount of suppression. Brian, we're probably going to leave our guidance where it is, but the main thing we wanted people to just know that it's been unusually low at this point and don't get too used to the unusually low level. And so that's why it's the double effect that we're calling for the double effect of the normal significant seasonal increase that we have in the fourth quarter around things like our sponsorships and a lot of things that happened late in the year, as well as the continuation of what happened late in the quarter looking at the marketing levels and card. A phenomenon that was not visible in the aggregated credit numbers because it just turned out by coincidence, some of the marketing elsewhere in the company around retail, which had really been sort of higher right out of the gate with all the deposit inflows that we've had, we pulled back somewhat on the retail."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Capital One Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period . Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Matt, and I'd like to also welcome everyone to Capital One's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log onto Capital One's Web site, capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2020 results.\nScott Blackley: Thanks, Jeff. Capital One recorded a net loss for the second quarter of $918 million or $2.21 per diluted common share, primarily driven by $2.7 billion allowance build, reflecting the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusting items impacted operating expenses during the quarter and totaled $276 million or $0.60 a share, including the provision for legal matters, as well as costs related to our cyber incident. Net of these adjusting items, our EPS was a loss of $1.61 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The second quarter allowance build of $2.7 billion consists of $1.7 billion in card, $668 million in auto and $330 million in commercial. Our allowance is based primarily on an economic forecast derived from the consensus of third-party economists. That forecast includes unemployment in the second quarter of 16.9%, falling to 11.5% at the end of 2020 and gradually improving over the course of 2021 and at 8.1%. Of course, our strong credit performance so far shows that the normal relationship between unemployment and consumer credit has been significantly altered by lending hardship programs and especially by government stimulus, including direct consumer support through the CARES Act. Looking ahead, in our allowance we've assumed no such benefit from further stimulus beyond the residual benefits of the existing legislation, which starts running out after July.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic drove second quarter results across all of our business segments. In our credit card business, loan balances, purchase volume and revenue, declined year over year. And as Scott just discussed, we posted a significant allowance build. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances shrink by $3.6 billion or 3% year-over-year, while average loans declined 1%. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio acquisition, ending loans shrink by around 10% year-over-year while average loans were down about 8%. Purchase volume for the quarter declined 15.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Looking at weekly trends, the year-over-year decline in purchase volume was down 32% in the second week of April and has since rebounded. Over the last three weeks ended July 17, the year-over-year decline has averaged just 3%. Total company net interchange revenue for the second quarter was down about 18% year-over-year. The declines in loan balances and purchase volume are a result of several factors; the broader effects of the pandemic, consumers behaving rationally in response to the COVID economic shutdown and our choices to pull back in marketing and tightened underwritings. As they've done in prior downturns, consumers are pulling in their spending and paying down balances. This cautious behavior is an important driver of both declining volumes and our strong credit performance.\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As always as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question with a single follow up. If you have any follow up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Matt, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you . Our first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: A couple of questions, just first off I wanted to understand a little bit about the folks who had enrolled but are no longer enrolled. You have those nice charts on auto and the domestic card. And I wanted to understand the folks that have rolled off. What has their payment history been like and what are you anticipating over the next quarter from them?\nRichard Fairbank: So, Betsy, the no longer enrolled population includes all customers who have either made a payment, or completed a billing cycle following the forbearance period and have not re-enrolled. As such, it is mostly customers who have resumed regular payment patterns but also includes a much smaller group of customers who have not resumed paying us and are advancing in or toward delinquency. You get visibility to customers in that situation through our normal delinquency reporting.\nBetsy Graseck: And so my follow-up is the delinquencies look really good this quarter, and we see it every month obviously, when you give us update on the managed data. So, I guess I'm wondering, why you think there's that disconnect? And given the 11% reserve ratio you already have set aside against card and the low level of delinquencies you have. Do you see much in the way of reserve build in 3Q versus 2Q?\nScott Blackley: Betsy, why don't we work backwards and I'll go to your question on the allowance. With the allowance from here, it's really going to depend on some of the major drivers of our reserve build in the quarter. I talked about those being our economic scenario and our approach to stimulus. And I feel like those have both a conservative bias when I look at them at this point. So, I would say that I feel very good about the allowance that we've got today given what we've seen since the end of the quarter. But in the future, I think it's going to come down to if the economic outlook and forecasts get worse then that would lead to an allowance build. And then on the other side of that, all else being equal, if we did see more stimulus that would be a positive to the allowance and we could see an offset to the potential effects of the economic scenario that we built the allowance on this quarter. So, I don't have a specific guide for you as to whether we think it's going to be going up or down. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of what may drive it in the future.\nOperator: Next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: So, maybe first from the dividend. So looks like the capacity to keep the dividend was higher for 3Q. So I guess, are you factoring in the income test staying in place beyond this quarter and do you expect to maintain the dividend beyond this quarter? And then I guess second, if you did maintain the $0.10, it does seem like there's a pretty sizable bounce back in earnings for the back half of the year. So, can you maybe just clarify what's been baked in. And just lastly, how quickly do you think you could reinstate the dividend? Thanks. And I have a follow up.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks Ryan, and that was about four questions built into one, but let me give a couple of thoughts. So on the $0.10 dividend, I think if you did the math, which is based off of net income, technically I think we could pay about $0.13 dividend this quarter. We rounded down to a dime and of course that's subject to you know our Board approving that at some point in the future. And in terms of looking forward with Q4 at this point, I honestly don't know how the fed rules are going to play out into the fourth quarter. We don't know how that income limitation test is going to work if they're going to continue it on, you know that they've instituted a fall stress test for all of the 33 banks in CCAR. So, I'm not going to give a guide on where the dividend is going to be next quarter. We're committed to continuing to have a dividend. I appreciate how important that is to a number of our owners. And then I would just say with respect to earnings, you know we do have a net loss for the three cumulative quarters ended Q2, I think that we would need to make over $1.1 billion next quarter in order to pay dividends, whether or not that's going to happen. And I think it\u2019s going to be really largely driven on what happens with the allowance, and I just talked about some of the drivers there. So, I don't mean to not be specific as to whether or not we're going to pay it. But I would just leave you with, we are committed to doing the best we can to make sure that we preserve the dividend.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And I'll try to be briefer in my second one. So, I guess, Rich, you know if you think about it. You have a bird's eye view of the most impacted verticals, consumer via card and auto, commercial including oil and gas and some high impacted commercial real estate. Could you rank order for us to just talk about your concerns in each of the asset classes where you're feeling better or worse relative to three months ago? And then second you talked about forbearing helping in the near term. Can you just maybe help us understand how to think about that historical relationship between unemployment and losses? Because it seems like you're reserving for a lot of historical relationships coming to fruition. But clearly, we could see benefits from the forbearance, helping customers make payments as you\u2019ve showed in the slide.\nRichard Fairbank: So on a little comparison here. Let me start with how the various parts of our business, the industries we're in entered the downturn. Our consumer business is the industries we felt that were particularly healthy, the card business I'd put at the top of the list in terms of a rational industry conservative underwriting by the players there. And the consumer was also, given how long in the tooth the downturn was, the consumer was still acting very rationally as well. So, all of those things are very different from the great recession and how we entered it, the industry entered that one. The auto business I'd give it pretty high marks going in for similar reasons and pretty strong consumer in a competitive environment that always kind of amplified and volatized, if you will, by dealer being an intermediary in the middle but pretty rational. We were concerned much more about the commercial business, because of practices, credit practices and behaviors, underwriting behaviors that we saw mostly outside of the banking industry in the institutional marketplace, but which it\u2019s hard to avoid having that impact, the commercial banking part of the business as well. So, since then to me the thing that I'm most struck by is how strong yet again the consumers steps up and the rationality of the consumer I\u2019m so struck by. The pulling back on purchases, savings rates going way up, payment rates, which also are kind of a hidden factor in slowing down growth, the flip side of good credit, those behaviors have just been very apparent across our consumer lending businesses. And I've always throughout my three decades of doing this, building this company, been very struck by how rational the consumer is and we see that there. The huge sort of elephant in the room on the consumer side and it's an elephant on the commercial side, as well as what happens to government stimulus. And I just think a lot of things have lined up that have softened the impact for consumers, even really those who have been unemployed. And so, we are seeing this great paradox of extraordinary credit performance in the middle of the worst economy metrics in our lifetimes. So, I think that's a hard one to prognosticate where it goes from here but I give really high marks to the strength of the consumer and I see solid continuing underwriting behavior by competitors in that marketplace. Commercial is really a blend of so many different marketplaces. And so while we have a lot of -- there's a lot of healthy industries we're in and where do we look with concern at the top of our list is energy, which is already taking it on the chin before the downturn, and is now struggling now even more so with what's happening to oil prices. The places that, other places of course in commercial real estate hotel, we have very small exposure there that's not a good area. We're pleased that we dialed back a lot on our retail CRE exposure. So, we feel quite good there. We have an eye out on the multifamily side just for the, what happens with the forbearance programs. For example, in New York, we're coming to the end of the 90-day moratorium on evictions and the increased unemployment pay. So, I think there's uncertainty there. So, it's a tale of a lot of different cities and commercial. But if I pull way up, I'm just -- every month as we go through the downturn with strong credit performance that's one more month of progress and it limits, it lessens the extent of the downside and the rest of the pandemic. But we've got the big wild card as we referred to, you see it reflected in our allowance build. And therefore, we're managing in a very dichotomous situation here that is quite extraordinary to experience.\nOperator: Next question will come from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.\nRick Shane: I'm really struck by the difference between the utilization of the customer assistance programs on the auto side and the card side. Is that a reflection in the current environment of the utility of the credit card versus the utility of card, or is it a function of the amortizing nature of auto loans versus the minimum payment ability on a card?\nRichard Fairbank: I think it is, there are several things going on. And you see this effect to Capital One and you can also see it across the industry. There's just naturally a lot more ambient demand or forbearance programs in the auto business than there is in cards. By the way, you could also add mortgage into that comment that there's a lot of demand there. So, one fundamental reason is that auto payments are typically much higher than card minimum payment. And so, they're just more likely to be beyond the reach of a given customer whose income is disrupted. And within both businesses, not just as we compare across the two businesses but within both businesses, we've seen a strong correlation between demand for forbearance programs and the size of the payment due. The second reason I think also in that auto the stakes are higher for the customer and they're very motivated to make sure that they can keep the car. So, we're not surprised by these differences. One thing that I think is just a point, an investor point here is that because a relatively small number of our card customers have in fact raised their hand to obtain to programs, and so many of them are already getting out of this. I think you're able to have a really clear, pretty darn clear window into the credit performance of Capital One, even inclusive of the forbearance programs. It's a little harder to, because the auto forbearance numbers are larger, it's not quite as clear in terms of where the credit numbers overtime will go, even though we are certainly very bullish about how well the program is performing. But I think what I kind of feel investors, they're little bit throwing their hands up and say in a period of with all this forbearance going on in individual companies, how are we able to read the credit metrics. I think, there is a high level of clarity on the card side in particular at the moment.\nRick Shane: And that actually segues perfectly into my follow up, which is that when we look then at the reserve or the allowance levels for each of the products, the implied loss frequency on card is substantially higher. Is the way to think of the longer this persists there is more embedded risk in the card portfolio?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, I think that the loss rates on card are higher, because it's a unsecured product. Rick, I also think that when it comes to the auto business, we have fairly high levels of recovery on the collateral there. And then in the reserving that we've done this particular quarter in auto, a portion of that was actually driven by the growth that we saw there. So, I think they're just different asset classes with different characteristics and certainly the average card book has higher losses than what we see in our auto book.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I have a two part question or two questions on preprovision earnings. Scott, maybe you could just outline how you see the NIM and revenue unfolding over the course of the year, and maybe any other mitigation efforts you might have? And then secondly, as far as loan growth is concerned, Rich talked about the improving trends in purchase volume. You've also had some of the other auto finance players talking about OEM production increasing and that might lead to no dealer inventory to sell and loan growth. Could you just talk about broadly sort of loan growth as it unfolds over the rest of the year?\nScott Blackley: So Sanjay, I'll start off on some thoughts around NIM. And you know, it certainly feels like NIM is kind of at the low end of where I would expect it should be for our company. And there's a few factors driving that, which I talked about in my comments and talking points. But if you think about where that might be going in the future, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we're working really hard to continue to deploy more of our cash into higher yielding investments, whether that's the investment portfolio where I think we can put some work there, offsetting wholesale funding, maturities, those are some examples. But candidly given the current rate environment where we are in this downturn, I would anticipate that cash levels are going to remain high until we start to see some stabilization there. So, we'll try to make some progress but I don't think we'll be able to really change that dramatically. On the asset mix effects, certainly the decreasing card this quarter was a big headwind on our net interest margin. I think depending on what happens with our opportunities in the market, where we feel comfortable continuing to step in, those will be major drivers of what happens to NIM going forward. And then on the deposit side, I think the benchmark rates have fallen more than what we've seen in our pricing. And as Rich talked about in his talking points, some of our pricing actions happened late in the quarter. So, we'll see the full benefit of those coming through next quarter, which should be a tailwind for NIM. I also think that we're starting to see datas accelerating across the industry and I think there's probably more opportunities for continuing to price down deposits at this point in the cycle. So, that's kind of where I see NIM going from here. On loan growth outlook, I think that that that is a bit of a question mark about how this pandemic plays out and where we see opportunities. We've obviously found that there's some great opportunities in auto in ways that we feel comfortable with our origination strategy and what we're seeing in there. With respect to card, there's certainly pockets where we think we can continue to acquire new accounts. And we'll have to see how payment rates play out, because that's a major driver in what happens with outstandings. We've seen great credit, part of that is high payment rates. The flip side of that is that that has a tendency to drive down outstanding. So, on low growth, I think that we're a little bit kind of looking at what is available in the market is going to drive our behavior. And it\u2019s a time now to be to be cautious but we also are always looking for opportunities to take advantage of spots where we see the market available to us.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. \nDon Fandetti: I know there's some concern around economic weakness in the south and southwest more recently. Have you seen anything that would suggest there's some pressure? And also the forbearance and cards, looks like it maybe have ticked up a little bit. Just curious if that's continuing to hold steady?\nScott Blackley: So Don, we have not seen any big geographical effects. We certainly are on the lookout for them. I think the government stimulus and the forbearance that's generally going on in the industry has sort of moderated credit issues broadly across all the geographies. With respect to forbearance, there's a reasonable amount of variation by state in a way that's intuitive given the differential impact of the virus so far. So for example, in our card business, Florida, New Jersey, New York, certainly, earlier on have been states with some of the highest enrollment rate. So, the forbearance thing it matches intuition pretty closely.\nRichard Fairbank: Don, just one more comment on your question about regional differences. A lot of the information that we're looking at tends to be backward looking. And so as this pandemic is evolving, we haven't seen anything specific with the south or the southwest just yet, that may be because we're looking at backward facing data and there may be more coming.\nDon Fandetti: And then I guess, you'd mentioned there's no additional stimulus built into your reserve build. The $600 extra average weekly unemployment is pretty material. Would you agree that that could have a material impact on your charge-offs if that were not extended?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, that's a big part of why our allowance builds have been the size that they are is that we had certainly seen that there has been an effective income replacement with a lot of the unemployment benefits that you talked about, as well as just other direct-to-consumer stimulus. And to the extent that that unemployment isn't offset with other programs or even forbearance, our allowance is built on a premise that that would translate into higher losses at some point in the future.\nOperator: Next question will comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.\nEric Wasserstrom: Rich or Scott, my question is about the loss curve. My own model is showing an very unusual shape which is as, it\u2019s pretty flat to the third quarter and stairs up higher in the fourth as some of the deferral actions have been. And then set functions higher again in the second quarter of next year when the deferral on the assumption that some of those deferred cash flows are going to service other kinds of debt. Could you just give me a sense of about your own view of the loss curve looks like and whether it looks unusual relative to\u2026\nJeff Norris: Eric? Excuse me, Eric. I'm so sorry. We're having a great deal of difficulty understanding you.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay. Can you hear me better now?\nJeff Norris: It's still a little muddled. I'm so sorry.\nEric Wasserstrom: Is it any better now? That's much better.\nJeff Norris: Okay. Sorry about that. My question was just about your expectations for the shape of the loss curve, whether in fact it still looks like a curve or more like a step function at different levels of forbearance, whether it's your own or whether it's things like GSE forbearance, which may influence how other asset classes perform.\nRichard Fairbank: Eric, one of the challenges that we faced in our allowances this exact point that you're bringing up. We've got a delinquency inventory that has incredibly low delinquency embedded in it right now and an unemployment forecast that's suggesting that that's got to normalize at some point. How that's going to workout I think is going to really depend on what happens with stimulus. If we do see some of this stimulus just suddenly drop-off, I think we will see some clip function around that starting to translate into delinquencies. Whether or not how forbearance impacts that, I'm sure that there will be some tempering with forbearance that will continue on in those periods. But I would anticipate that the lack of stimulus would be the major driver in terms of where loss curves would look like here in overtime if those benefits weigh off.\nEric Wasserstrom: And then my follow-up is just on OpEx. Rich, obviously good to hear about the reinstation of the, the reinstatement of the efficiency target. But has there been any change or incremental actions or anything incremental to the prior target that you're looking at given the current circumstances?\nRichard Fairbank: So, Eric, there are natural forces in a sharp downturn like this that pressure the revenue trajectory. Certainly, with the purchase volume declines the demand for card loans drop and interest rates fall. So, we certainly, the pressure is certainly coming on the revenue side. So, in terms of what we're doing, the actions that we're taking, we talked about we're tightening our extension of new credit. We\u2019re pulling back on marketing. And these things naturally put pressure on loan growth. So, kind of to your point. So what we're, first of all on the revenue side, we, it's not a binary thing to us that where there\u2019s a downturn so therefore, one hunkers down. We have a lot of experience over all these years living through downturns. We have to us, all of our choices are very, very segment and micro segments specific. So there's going to be a real gradient with respect to how we lean into those opportunities in this environment. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're just totally in hunker down mode until the pandemic end. But what we have done is we kind of started the downturn with a pretty broad pullback as the world was kind of in physical free fall. And then we have really carefully assessed by segment what are we getting as, what kind of information we have that can help us predict how consumers are going to do in this particular pandemic? What are we seeing with respect to adverse selection, or in few cases maybe even some paradoxical positive selection that you sometimes see in a downturn like this. So, our energy is particularly focused on the response, the differential response we're doing during the pandemic and leveraging the information we have, including the ability to get a bunch of information in real time, because of our tech transformation in order to find some good revenue opportunities. On the expense, side we have really tightened up on hiring. For example, that's a very natural thing to do and we have done that. We are meeting very frequently, just working on overall how can we manage our expenses really tightly. And this is all in the context where we still importantly making the necessary investments to manage the pandemic response. We don't want to certainly cut back on that. We still expect to benefit from the exit of the data centers. Later this year, all of that is unaffected by the pandemic. And of course, in terms of the total efficiency ratio, the reduction in marketing is a good guy for total efficiency ratio. So, when we look at what it was that drove us to target to 42% annual operating efficiency ratio. All of those same factors and the things happening with our business model and the success in technology and all of that, all of that is still entirely intact with respect to the business model. This is all about timing at this point. And so, we've pulled back on the timing of our commitment to that target. But the energy and what led us to achieve the kind of success we have on the efficiency side, what led us to achieve the tech success and all the things that had gotten us where we are on the credit side, all of that energy is we're all in on that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch: I guess Scott or Rich, could you talk a little bit about when you think about the level of reserves going forward. You talked a lot about, Scott talked a lot about stimulus a couple of times. But assuming that that's going to be one item that when you think about changes, is it going to be changes in unemployment? Or how much can the consumer behavior that you've seen that's a positive impact your kind of expectation for how much reserves are needed? Or is it just going to be based on that employment level?\nScott Blackley: Well, I think Moshe, thus far, a lot of the consumer behavior is driving what we're seeing in terms of credit performance. So that's a huge part of it some of that stimulus but I think some of it is just disciplined behavior by consumers and by a lot of our competitors in the industry. As I think about going forward, I do think that as I talked about earlier. I think stimulus is going to be a major driver of what happens with the reserve. But I do believe that the consumer had that experience from the financial crisis. A lot of wisdom that has been learned there. And we've seen a lot of discipline in that regard. So, I'm not sure that as I think about where the allowances going while unemployment is going to be a major driver, I think that some of the other factors that we've talked about and Rich mentioned several of them in his talking points, are going to be important offsets there in terms of what might happen in terms of good relationship between unemployment and the credit losses as we go forward.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And following up on the previous question about marketing, I mean, it's kind of pretty stark if you think about. You probably have, I don't know, north of a 60% decline in credit card marketing in the quarter and you've got volumes actually up double digits in auto. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the two markets that kind of make that the right way to go right now? And what would make you want to start marketing again more activity in the card space?\nRichard Fairbank: So Moshe, let me just talk a little bit about auto and then move to credit card. So, we actually in both card and auto, our first response was to tighten underwriting and we have had a tighter credit box in both of the businesses. There are number of things happening in the auto business that sort of are causing better high-quality volume to come Capital One's way even with the tighter credit box. And so, we're scrutinizing very, very carefully with everything about what we see in this volume and the early performance. But, I wouldn't underestimate the importance of the digital capabilities that we have that have been helpful during the pandemic. But we'll have to see what competition does overtime. And we're going to again really, really carefully scrutinize what comes in. There's also in the auto side particularly in certain segments of the business ability to have a lot more information in real time, which can allow one to have more clarity on the customer's condition, situation and with better guess then on how they may perform. So on the card side, typically in underwriting there is less information available in unsecured loan of course. And we\u2019re even at a time where the reliability of credit bureau information is likely less over this period of time, just because of certain things about companies not reporting on forbearance during this period of time. So, that also make things a little bit more challenging. Now the flip side of that, Moshe, for us where we have been, we always talk about the origination lever and the credit line lever are two separate decisions. And we've always said that the real, for a lot of our business, the real exposure comes on the credit line side, not really the origination side. So, we have been more leaning in on the origination side and the conservatism has particularly come with respect to credit lines. And as you know from having watched us manage that through time, we're trying to continue to build the potential energy as carried by the originating new accounts, hold back for the time being on the credit line and then trying to get as much information as we can on each customer and watching very carefully their situation, pick -- over time really open up on the credit lines. But the loan growth will come more on the credit line side and that is a level and a dial that we're going to be managing along the way during the downturn. So, the net effect of all of that is something that ends up with, you know, at this point higher volumes in card. And then the final point I want to make is the relationship of course between marketing and all this, because you know dial backs in marketing tend to therefore generate lower volume. So, what early on in the downturn like most of the other players, we dialed back in marketing. What we are doing is like everything is not a one size fits all, but it's going to be a sloped level of marketing by channel, by segment, by product. But we're hopeful that we can generate some good origination results over time by a very sloped differential customized effort on the marketing side.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Richard, pretty high level question and you touched on some of the components of the answer it is, but I figure I'd still ask it anyway. So, you've managed this business through variety of different downturns and pullbacks, and recognizing that this one is much different than and they all are different I suppose. At this point of the downturn, how do you see yourself as prioritizing different objectives, and what kind of opportunities might come out of that if you compare and contrast this one to the last few downturns?\nRichard Fairbank: I think a few things about this downturn that are different. Again, I think on the consumer side, significantly more healthy consumer and marketplace going into this one then the last one. So the last one had to work its way through so many kind of structural problems on the way to getting to the other side of the downturn. It made the last great recession that was tough. So, it\u2019s a cleaner situation on the consumer side of the business. The really striking thing about this downturn is how immediate it was. You look back to the great recession. I mean, lots of the indicators were there in \u201807, but this was a rolling downturn that took a lot of months and even sort of measured in years to play out. In this one, I'm so struck by the fact that everybody sort goes down the elevator at the same time. We're talking about consumers, we're talking about companies who serve them, banks and the government. I think, so because of the vertical drop down the elevator where it's not clear what floor it\u2019s going to stop at you saw such a conservative response by consumers that that's the flip side. So that's bad for volumes but really good for my credit health and savings and all the aspects of that. That is really striking in comparison to any downturn I've seen before. Because of the vertical drop, you've also seen companies really you know mobilize in very rational ways and pull back much more quickly than they did in the downturn and that leads to a healthier situation as well. And then I think the vertical drop allowed the political environment to coalesce around significant stimulus programs that would be so difficult if this were rolling 18 months to really get into this then. So that to me is what is so unique about this. And so, now it's led to this really extraordinary kind of paradoxical situation where the actual performance of the customers. And I'm especially talking about the consumer business, the performance is so strong but the economic numbers are so bad. A lot of, how these things play out is really going to be driven by choices that happen on the government side or perhaps the collective forbearance choices that will be made by the banking industry and beyond. But another thing that I think is important, Jeff, as a mental thought here is think about a metaphor a downturn tends to have. Worsening is like big mountain and things go way up and then they come down. With every month of solid performance by the consumer in a sense, we're burrowing a tunnel through the mountain. And every month that passes as you get through the mountain in some sense, all other things being equal, it can serve to limit some of the downside that can come in even as there's a fairly rapid ascent if some of the stimulus, for example, is removed. But in all of this what I find this very energizing times from a business point of view to look for where are the risks, where are the differential opportunities, how can we capitalize on the ability to do real time underwriting and leverage a lot of data and that data is a pay off of our tech transformation and leverage three decades of experience, but also really understand what is unique about this downturn. And I think, we are -- that's what we're spending so much energy doing right now. And I think across our businesses, there's going to be a very sloped kind of amount of growth or shrinkage depending on the unique opportunity.\nOperator: And our final question of the evening will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nBob Napoli: Strange times indeed, most of the questions on credit. But I guess, Rich, I think just one thing. And I tend to agree with your comment that the longer this goes the less risk I think on the consumer side. And do you think that the stimulus and the consumer reaction has essentially covered some of the charge-offs that would have occurred, that they will not occur because of the stimulus funds that were available? And then said it seems that some people think that companies such as yours don't make any adjustments to the underwriting side. But what percentage of your current borrowers in the credit card business are unemployed? And when you're making underwriting new loans, I would assume that new loans don't go to people who are unemployed. You don't extend credit lines to those that are generally unemployed. But do you also carry that further and look by industry and say, well, Delta Airlines is about to lay-off half of their workforce, we probably should be more conservative with airline employees. And so just some thoughts on whether you think those charge-offs are permanently removed, because of stimulus potentially. And then just some comments on the underwriting. How many of your current borrowers are unemployed and how you have changed underwriting?\nRichard Fairbank: So, I don't think we have a rigorous measure of how many of our current borrowers are unemployed. But since we have a big chunk of America, I think that our borrowing base is reflective of America. And there are a lot of people that are in different degrees of unemployment right now. And so, even as there's such great credit performance right now, what we're  about is kind of looking beyond that to a number of the things that, you've talked about how to underwrite with as much information as we can and as wisely as we can. Past performance is not necessarily such a great predictor of future performance at a time like this. But we call our whole strategy at Capital One the information-based strategy. This is a time where data really matters. And so, we're putting a lot of energy into that very thing, along the lines of a lot of things that you're talking about. So, marshalling as much information as we can, leveraging the capabilities Capital One has built to having data is one thing, getting data and leveraging it in real time is another thing. And that's one of the things that we've been focused on with respect to our technology transformation. And then finally, how does one also in a world where you can't be assertive on the underwriting side, how do we put other mitigating protections in, in the structure of how we build our products. And the low line credit, the low line strategy that Capital One particularly is beneficial at a time like this. Originating with lower lines and saying we'll waiting for awhile on the line increase side of things. But we will continue to originate the account subject to the tighter credit box we talked about. On the auto side, we have invested very heavily in real time information-based underwriting. And like I said earlier, the amount of data available in the auto underwriting process in real time compared with card is a whole level higher. I mean, it\u2019s partly an industry point and partly some of the particular places that we've gone at Capital One. And so, I think that with some of the clarity that we're able to see particularly well there, we can make some good choices but also we're able to put in more structures, more protections, stronger pricing, into the underwriting that's a very important thing in addition to just the prediction of the underlying risk of the consumer themselves.\nBob Napoli: Great, appreciate your answers and have good evening.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks very much, Bob.\nJeff Norris: I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on this conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, investors relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good night, everyone.\nOperator: That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. I'll begin on Slide 10, which summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic drove second quarter results across all of our business segments. In our credit card business, loan balances, purchase volume and revenue, declined year over year. And as Scott just discussed, we posted a significant allowance build. Credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances shrink by $3.6 billion or 3% year-over-year, while average loans declined 1%. Excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio acquisition, ending loans shrink by around 10% year-over-year while average loans were down about 8%. Purchase volume for the quarter declined 15.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Looking at weekly trends, the year-over-year decline in purchase volume was down 32% in the second week of April and has since rebounded. Over the last three weeks ended July 17, the year-over-year decline has averaged just 3%. Total company net interchange revenue for the second quarter was down about 18% year-over-year. The declines in loan balances and purchase volume are a result of several factors; the broader effects of the pandemic, consumers behaving rationally in response to the COVID economic shutdown and our choices to pull back in marketing and tightened underwritings. As they've done in prior downturns, consumers are pulling in their spending and paying down balances. This cautious behavior is an important driver of both declining volumes and our strong credit performance. So, Betsy, the no longer enrolled population includes all customers who have either made a payment, or completed a billing cycle following the forbearance period and have not re-enrolled. As such, it is mostly customers who have resumed regular payment patterns but also includes a much smaller group of customers who have not resumed paying us and are advancing in or toward delinquency. You get visibility to customers in that situation through our normal delinquency reporting. Thanks Ryan, and that was about four questions built into one, but let me give a couple of thoughts. So on the $0.10 dividend, I think if you did the math, which is based off of net income, technically I think we could pay about $0.13 dividend this quarter. We rounded down to a dime and of course that's subject to you know our Board approving that at some point in the future. And in terms of looking forward with Q4 at this point, I honestly don't know how the fed rules are going to play out into the fourth quarter. We don't know how that income limitation test is going to work if they're going to continue it on, you know that they've instituted a fall stress test for all of the 33 banks in CCAR. So, I'm not going to give a guide on where the dividend is going to be next quarter. We're committed to continuing to have a dividend. I appreciate how important that is to a number of our owners. And then I would just say with respect to earnings, you know we do have a net loss for the three cumulative quarters ended Q2, I think that we would need to make over $1.1 billion next quarter in order to pay dividends, whether or not that's going to happen. And I think it's going to be really largely driven on what happens with the allowance, and I just talked about some of the drivers there. So, I don't mean to not be specific as to whether or not we're going to pay it. But I would just leave you with, we are committed to doing the best we can to make sure that we preserve the dividend. So on a little comparison here. Let me start with how the various parts of our business, the industries we're in entered the downturn. Our consumer business is the industries we felt that were particularly healthy, the card business I'd put at the top of the list in terms of a rational industry conservative underwriting by the players there. And the consumer was also, given how long in the tooth the downturn was, the consumer was still acting very rationally as well. So, all of those things are very different from the great recession and how we entered it, the industry entered that one. The auto business I'd give it pretty high marks going in for similar reasons and pretty strong consumer in a competitive environment that always kind of amplified and volatized, if you will, by dealer being an intermediary in the middle but pretty rational. We were concerned much more about the commercial business, because of practices, credit practices and behaviors, underwriting behaviors that we saw mostly outside of the banking industry in the institutional marketplace, but which it's hard to avoid having that impact, the commercial banking part of the business as well. So, since then to me the thing that I'm most struck by is how strong yet again the consumers steps up and the rationality of the consumer I'm so struck by. The pulling back on purchases, savings rates going way up, payment rates, which also are kind of a hidden factor in slowing down growth, the flip side of good credit, those behaviors have just been very apparent across our consumer lending businesses. And I've always throughout my three decades of doing this, building this company, been very struck by how rational the consumer is and we see that there. The huge sort of elephant in the room on the consumer side and it's an elephant on the commercial side, as well as what happens to government stimulus. And I just think a lot of things have lined up that have softened the impact for consumers, even really those who have been unemployed. And so, we are seeing this great paradox of extraordinary credit performance in the middle of the worst economy metrics in our lifetimes. So, I think that's a hard one to prognosticate where it goes from here but I give really high marks to the strength of the consumer and I see solid continuing underwriting behavior by competitors in that marketplace. Commercial is really a blend of so many different marketplaces. And so while we have a lot of -- there's a lot of healthy industries we're in and where do we look with concern at the top of our list is energy, which is already taking it on the chin before the downturn, and is now struggling now even more so with what's happening to oil prices. The places that, other places of course in commercial real estate hotel, we have very small exposure there that's not a good area. We're pleased that we dialed back a lot on our retail CRE exposure. So, we feel quite good there. We have an eye out on the multifamily side just for the, what happens with the forbearance programs. For example, in New York, we're coming to the end of the 90-day moratorium on evictions and the increased unemployment pay. So, I think there's uncertainty there. So, it's a tale of a lot of different cities and commercial. But if I pull way up, I'm just -- every month as we go through the downturn with strong credit performance that's one more month of progress and it limits, it lessens the extent of the downside and the rest of the pandemic. But we've got the big wild card as we referred to, you see it reflected in our allowance build. And therefore, we're managing in a very dichotomous situation here that is quite extraordinary to experience. I think it is, there are several things going on. And you see this effect to Capital One and you can also see it across the industry. There's just naturally a lot more ambient demand or forbearance programs in the auto business than there is in cards. By the way, you could also add mortgage into that comment that there's a lot of demand there. So, one fundamental reason is that auto payments are typically much higher than card minimum payment. And so, they're just more likely to be beyond the reach of a given customer whose income is disrupted. And within both businesses, not just as we compare across the two businesses but within both businesses, we've seen a strong correlation between demand for forbearance programs and the size of the payment due. The second reason I think also in that auto the stakes are higher for the customer and they're very motivated to make sure that they can keep the car. So, we're not surprised by these differences. One thing that I think is just a point, an investor point here is that because a relatively small number of our card customers have in fact raised their hand to obtain to programs, and so many of them are already getting out of this. I think you're able to have a really clear, pretty darn clear window into the credit performance of Capital One, even inclusive of the forbearance programs. It's a little harder to, because the auto forbearance numbers are larger, it's not quite as clear in terms of where the credit numbers overtime will go, even though we are certainly very bullish about how well the program is performing. But I think what I kind of feel investors, they're little bit throwing their hands up and say in a period of with all this forbearance going on in individual companies, how are we able to read the credit metrics. I think, there is a high level of clarity on the card side in particular at the moment. Well, I think that the loss rates on card are higher, because it's a unsecured product. Rick, I also think that when it comes to the auto business, we have fairly high levels of recovery on the collateral there. And then in the reserving that we've done this particular quarter in auto, a portion of that was actually driven by the growth that we saw there. So, I think they're just different asset classes with different characteristics and certainly the average card book has higher losses than what we see in our auto book. Don, just one more comment on your question about regional differences. A lot of the information that we're looking at tends to be backward looking. And so as this pandemic is evolving, we haven't seen anything specific with the south or the southwest just yet, that may be because we're looking at backward facing data and there may be more coming. Well, that's a big part of why our allowance builds have been the size that they are is that we had certainly seen that there has been an effective income replacement with a lot of the unemployment benefits that you talked about, as well as just other direct-to-consumer stimulus. And to the extent that that unemployment isn't offset with other programs or even forbearance, our allowance is built on a premise that that would translate into higher losses at some point in the future. Eric, one of the challenges that we faced in our allowances this exact point that you're bringing up. We've got a delinquency inventory that has incredibly low delinquency embedded in it right now and an unemployment forecast that's suggesting that that's got to normalize at some point. How that's going to workout I think is going to really depend on what happens with stimulus. If we do see some of this stimulus just suddenly drop-off, I think we will see some clip function around that starting to translate into delinquencies. Whether or not how forbearance impacts that, I'm sure that there will be some tempering with forbearance that will continue on in those periods. But I would anticipate that the lack of stimulus would be the major driver in terms of where loss curves would look like here in overtime if those benefits weigh off. So, Eric, there are natural forces in a sharp downturn like this that pressure the revenue trajectory. Certainly, with the purchase volume declines the demand for card loans drop and interest rates fall. So, we certainly, the pressure is certainly coming on the revenue side. So, in terms of what we're doing, the actions that we're taking, we talked about we're tightening our extension of new credit. We're pulling back on marketing. And these things naturally put pressure on loan growth. So, kind of to your point. So what we're, first of all on the revenue side, we, it's not a binary thing to us that where there's a downturn so therefore, one hunkers down. We have a lot of experience over all these years living through downturns. We have to us, all of our choices are very, very segment and micro segments specific. So there's going to be a real gradient with respect to how we lean into those opportunities in this environment. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're just totally in hunker down mode until the pandemic end. But what we have done is we kind of started the downturn with a pretty broad pullback as the world was kind of in physical free fall. And then we have really carefully assessed by segment what are we getting as, what kind of information we have that can help us predict how consumers are going to do in this particular pandemic? What are we seeing with respect to adverse selection, or in few cases maybe even some paradoxical positive selection that you sometimes see in a downturn like this. So, our energy is particularly focused on the response, the differential response we're doing during the pandemic and leveraging the information we have, including the ability to get a bunch of information in real time, because of our tech transformation in order to find some good revenue opportunities. On the expense, side we have really tightened up on hiring. For example, that's a very natural thing to do and we have done that. We are meeting very frequently, just working on overall how can we manage our expenses really tightly. And this is all in the context where we still importantly making the necessary investments to manage the pandemic response. We don't want to certainly cut back on that. We still expect to benefit from the exit of the data centers. Later this year, all of that is unaffected by the pandemic. And of course, in terms of the total efficiency ratio, the reduction in marketing is a good guy for total efficiency ratio. So, when we look at what it was that drove us to target to 42% annual operating efficiency ratio. All of those same factors and the things happening with our business model and the success in technology and all of that, all of that is still entirely intact with respect to the business model. This is all about timing at this point. And so, we've pulled back on the timing of our commitment to that target. But the energy and what led us to achieve the kind of success we have on the efficiency side, what led us to achieve the tech success and all the things that had gotten us where we are on the credit side, all of that energy is we're all in on that. So Moshe, let me just talk a little bit about auto and then move to credit card. So, we actually in both card and auto, our first response was to tighten underwriting and we have had a tighter credit box in both of the businesses. There are number of things happening in the auto business that sort of are causing better high-quality volume to come Capital One's way even with the tighter credit box. And so, we're scrutinizing very, very carefully with everything about what we see in this volume and the early performance. But, I wouldn't underestimate the importance of the digital capabilities that we have that have been helpful during the pandemic. But we'll have to see what competition does overtime. And we're going to again really, really carefully scrutinize what comes in. There's also in the auto side particularly in certain segments of the business ability to have a lot more information in real time, which can allow one to have more clarity on the customer's condition, situation and with better guess then on how they may perform. So on the card side, typically in underwriting there is less information available in unsecured loan of course. And we're even at a time where the reliability of credit bureau information is likely less over this period of time, just because of certain things about companies not reporting on forbearance during this period of time. So, that also make things a little bit more challenging. Now the flip side of that, Moshe, for us where we have been, we always talk about the origination lever and the credit line lever are two separate decisions. And we've always said that the real, for a lot of our business, the real exposure comes on the credit line side, not really the origination side. So, we have been more leaning in on the origination side and the conservatism has particularly come with respect to credit lines. And as you know from having watched us manage that through time, we're trying to continue to build the potential energy as carried by the originating new accounts, hold back for the time being on the credit line and then trying to get as much information as we can on each customer and watching very carefully their situation, pick -- over time really open up on the credit lines. But the loan growth will come more on the credit line side and that is a level and a dial that we're going to be managing along the way during the downturn. So, the net effect of all of that is something that ends up with, you know, at this point higher volumes in card. And then the final point I want to make is the relationship of course between marketing and all this, because you know dial backs in marketing tend to therefore generate lower volume. So, what early on in the downturn like most of the other players, we dialed back in marketing. What we are doing is like everything is not a one size fits all, but it's going to be a sloped level of marketing by channel, by segment, by product. But we're hopeful that we can generate some good origination results over time by a very sloped differential customized effort on the marketing side. I think a few things about this downturn that are different. Again, I think on the consumer side, significantly more healthy consumer and marketplace going into this one then the last one. So the last one had to work its way through so many kind of structural problems on the way to getting to the other side of the downturn. It made the last great recession that was tough. So, it's a cleaner situation on the consumer side of the business. The really striking thing about this downturn is how immediate it was. You look back to the great recession. I mean, lots of the indicators were there in \u201807, but this was a rolling downturn that took a lot of months and even sort of measured in years to play out. In this one, I'm so struck by the fact that everybody sort goes down the elevator at the same time. We're talking about consumers, we're talking about companies who serve them, banks and the government. I think, so because of the vertical drop down the elevator where it's not clear what floor it's going to stop at you saw such a conservative response by consumers that that's the flip side. So that's bad for volumes but really good for my credit health and savings and all the aspects of that. That is really striking in comparison to any downturn I've seen before. Because of the vertical drop, you've also seen companies really you know mobilize in very rational ways and pull back much more quickly than they did in the downturn and that leads to a healthier situation as well. And then I think the vertical drop allowed the political environment to coalesce around significant stimulus programs that would be so difficult if this were rolling 18 months to really get into this then. So that to me is what is so unique about this. And so, now it's led to this really extraordinary kind of paradoxical situation where the actual performance of the customers. And I'm especially talking about the consumer business, the performance is so strong but the economic numbers are so bad. A lot of, how these things play out is really going to be driven by choices that happen on the government side or perhaps the collective forbearance choices that will be made by the banking industry and beyond. But another thing that I think is important, Jeff, as a mental thought here is think about a metaphor a downturn tends to have. Worsening is like big mountain and things go way up and then they come down. With every month of solid performance by the consumer in a sense, we're burrowing a tunnel through the mountain. And every month that passes as you get through the mountain in some sense, all other things being equal, it can serve to limit some of the downside that can come in even as there's a fairly rapid ascent if some of the stimulus, for example, is removed. But in all of this what I find this very energizing times from a business point of view to look for where are the risks, where are the differential opportunities, how can we capitalize on the ability to do real time underwriting and leverage a lot of data and that data is a pay off of our tech transformation and leverage three decades of experience, but also really understand what is unique about this downturn. And I think, we are -- that's what we're spending so much energy doing right now. And I think across our businesses, there's going to be a very sloped kind of amount of growth or shrinkage depending on the unique opportunity. So, I don't think we have a rigorous measure of how many of our current borrowers are unemployed. But since we have a big chunk of America, I think that our borrowing base is reflective of America. And there are a lot of people that are in different degrees of unemployment right now. And so, even as there's such great credit performance right now, what we're  about is kind of looking beyond that to a number of the things that, you've talked about how to underwrite with as much information as we can and as wisely as we can. Past performance is not necessarily such a great predictor of future performance at a time like this. But we call our whole strategy at Capital One the information-based strategy. This is a time where data really matters. And so, we're putting a lot of energy into that very thing, along the lines of a lot of things that you're talking about. So, marshalling as much information as we can, leveraging the capabilities Capital One has built to having data is one thing, getting data and leveraging it in real time is another thing. And that's one of the things that we've been focused on with respect to our technology transformation. And then finally, how does one also in a world where you can't be assertive on the underwriting side, how do we put other mitigating protections in, in the structure of how we build our products. And the low line credit, the low line strategy that Capital One particularly is beneficial at a time like this. Originating with lower lines and saying we'll waiting for awhile on the line increase side of things. But we will continue to originate the account subject to the tighter credit box we talked about. On the auto side, we have invested very heavily in real time information-based underwriting. And like I said earlier, the amount of data available in the auto underwriting process in real time compared with card is a whole level higher. I mean, it's partly an industry point and partly some of the particular places that we've gone at Capital One. And so, I think that with some of the clarity that we're able to see particularly well there, we can make some good choices but also we're able to put in more structures, more protections, stronger pricing, into the underwriting that's a very important thing in addition to just the prediction of the underlying risk of the consumer themselves. Thanks very much, Bob."

            "name": "Scott Blackley",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Capital One recorded a net loss for the second quarter of $918 million or $2.21 per diluted common share, primarily driven by $2.7 billion allowance build, reflecting the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusting items impacted operating expenses during the quarter and totaled $276 million or $0.60 a share, including the provision for legal matters, as well as costs related to our cyber incident. Net of these adjusting items, our EPS was a loss of $1.61 per share. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The second quarter allowance build of $2.7 billion consists of $1.7 billion in card, $668 million in auto and $330 million in commercial. Our allowance is based primarily on an economic forecast derived from the consensus of third-party economists. That forecast includes unemployment in the second quarter of 16.9%, falling to 11.5% at the end of 2020 and gradually improving over the course of 2021 and at 8.1%. Of course, our strong credit performance so far shows that the normal relationship between unemployment and consumer credit has been significantly altered by lending hardship programs and especially by government stimulus, including direct consumer support through the CARES Act. Looking ahead, in our allowance we've assumed no such benefit from further stimulus beyond the residual benefits of the existing legislation, which starts running out after July. Betsy, why don't we work backwards and I'll go to your question on the allowance. With the allowance from here, it's really going to depend on some of the major drivers of our reserve build in the quarter. I talked about those being our economic scenario and our approach to stimulus. And I feel like those have both a conservative bias when I look at them at this point. So, I would say that I feel very good about the allowance that we've got today given what we've seen since the end of the quarter. But in the future, I think it's going to come down to if the economic outlook and forecasts get worse then that would lead to an allowance build. And then on the other side of that, all else being equal, if we did see more stimulus that would be a positive to the allowance and we could see an offset to the potential effects of the economic scenario that we built the allowance on this quarter. So, I don't have a specific guide for you as to whether we think it's going to be going up or down. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of what may drive it in the future. So Sanjay, I'll start off on some thoughts around NIM. And you know, it certainly feels like NIM is kind of at the low end of where I would expect it should be for our company. And there's a few factors driving that, which I talked about in my comments and talking points. But if you think about where that might be going in the future, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we're working really hard to continue to deploy more of our cash into higher yielding investments, whether that's the investment portfolio where I think we can put some work there, offsetting wholesale funding, maturities, those are some examples. But candidly given the current rate environment where we are in this downturn, I would anticipate that cash levels are going to remain high until we start to see some stabilization there. So, we'll try to make some progress but I don't think we'll be able to really change that dramatically. On the asset mix effects, certainly the decreasing card this quarter was a big headwind on our net interest margin. I think depending on what happens with our opportunities in the market, where we feel comfortable continuing to step in, those will be major drivers of what happens to NIM going forward. And then on the deposit side, I think the benchmark rates have fallen more than what we've seen in our pricing. And as Rich talked about in his talking points, some of our pricing actions happened late in the quarter. So, we'll see the full benefit of those coming through next quarter, which should be a tailwind for NIM. I also think that we're starting to see datas accelerating across the industry and I think there's probably more opportunities for continuing to price down deposits at this point in the cycle. So, that's kind of where I see NIM going from here. On loan growth outlook, I think that that that is a bit of a question mark about how this pandemic plays out and where we see opportunities. We've obviously found that there's some great opportunities in auto in ways that we feel comfortable with our origination strategy and what we're seeing in there. With respect to card, there's certainly pockets where we think we can continue to acquire new accounts. And we'll have to see how payment rates play out, because that's a major driver in what happens with outstandings. We've seen great credit, part of that is high payment rates. The flip side of that is that that has a tendency to drive down outstanding. So, on low growth, I think that we're a little bit kind of looking at what is available in the market is going to drive our behavior. And it's a time now to be to be cautious but we also are always looking for opportunities to take advantage of spots where we see the market available to us. So Don, we have not seen any big geographical effects. We certainly are on the lookout for them. I think the government stimulus and the forbearance that's generally going on in the industry has sort of moderated credit issues broadly across all the geographies. With respect to forbearance, there's a reasonable amount of variation by state in a way that's intuitive given the differential impact of the virus so far. So for example, in our card business, Florida, New Jersey, New York, certainly, earlier on have been states with some of the highest enrollment rate. So, the forbearance thing it matches intuition pretty closely. Well, I think Moshe, thus far, a lot of the consumer behavior is driving what we're seeing in terms of credit performance. So that's a huge part of it some of that stimulus but I think some of it is just disciplined behavior by consumers and by a lot of our competitors in the industry. As I think about going forward, I do think that as I talked about earlier. I think stimulus is going to be a major driver of what happens with the reserve. But I do believe that the consumer had that experience from the financial crisis. A lot of wisdom that has been learned there. And we've seen a lot of discipline in that regard. So, I'm not sure that as I think about where the allowances going while unemployment is going to be a major driver, I think that some of the other factors that we've talked about and Rich mentioned several of them in his talking points, are going to be important offsets there in terms of what might happen in terms of good relationship between unemployment and the credit losses as we go forward."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Today's conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Matt, and welcome, everyone, to Capital One's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live on the Internet. Something that's not quite as usual in a time of social distancing, we're each webcasting from our own home, so please be patient with us if there's an occasional awkward pause or dog barking.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. Before we get into first quarter results, I'll begin tonight with an overview of COVID-19 and its impact. In roughly the last two weeks of the first quarter, the world changed abruptly as the spread of COVID-19 accelerated. Like all of you, we're watching with empathy and gratitude as people and communities take extraordinary action, care for the sick, support first responders and slow the transmission of the virus. At Capital One, we're focused on the well-being of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve, and we've fully mobilized to do our part to make an immediate positive impact. Enabled by our technology transformation, about 80% of our associates and 98% of our non-branch associates smoothly transitioned to remote working arrangements and are now securely and productively working from home. For our associates who must be at Capital One location, we've taken steps to improve social distancing, adopted flexible attendance and leave policies and increased hourly pay. For our customers, we're offering a range of forbearance options and taking steps to make it easier for banking customers to access their money while social distancing.\nScott Blackley: Thanks, Rich. Capital One lost $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share in the first quarter. Net of adjusting items, our EPS loss in the quarter was $3.02, driven by a $3.6 billion allowance build. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The adoption of CECL increased our allowance by $2.8 billion, as of January 1, 2020, in line with previously communicated expectations. Our first quarter allowance build of $3.6 billion consists of $2.2 billion in card, approximately $600 million in auto and approximately $700 million in commercial. We modeled several economic scenarios and then we added some judgmental overlays in determining our allowance. The most heavily weighted of these economic scenarios included a sharp increase to a peak unemployment during Q2 2020 of 9.5%, followed by an improvement into 2021. I would encourage you not to get too focused on the headline unemployment rate because it was just one of the many variables impacting our allowance.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Scott. This quarter, there is an obvious recurring theme in each of our businesses and for the company. First quarter results reflect two distinct time periods: January 1st through mid-March before COVID-19 impacts took hold; and the last two weeks of the quarter when COVID-19 drove sharp changes in many metrics and trends. Pre-COVID-19 results generally show solid momentum and strong performance on growth, credit and efficiency that have put Capital One in a strong position. Post-COVID-19 trends show a clear inflection, but there's too much uncertainty to simply extrapolate recent trends. With that context, I'll pick up on slide 10, which summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business. Pre-provision results were solid in the first quarter, with continued year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volumes. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances increased 8.4% year-over-year, driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. The emergence of COVID-19 impacts late in the quarter caused a deceleration in the growth of ending loan balance. First quarter average loans grew 11% year-over-year. First quarter purchase volume was up 8% from the first quarter of 2019, with strong growth through most of the quarter partially offset by sharp declines near the end of the quarter. By the end of the first quarter, weekly purchase volume was running at a year-over-year decline of about 30%. Consistent with industry trends, our largest declines were in travel and entertainment, restaurants and discretionary retail. These category decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending at supermarkets and discount stores. Through April 17, weekly purchase volume continues to be down about 30% year-over-year. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year. Growth in average loans was offset by lower revenue margin. The revenue margin declined 129 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any additional follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available to answer them. Matt, please start the Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you.  The first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Good evening. Thanks for taking the call and hope everybody is safe there. Rich, I guess I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the card business as we go through the next couple of years, in particular, how to integrate the new Walmart portfolio and relationship into the business that you've got and what it means for growth in that portfolio with that customer set?\nRichard Fairbank: So, Betsy, good evening. The Walmart integration has really happened. And so we have a wonderful working partnership with Walmart, really exceptional. And they -- I've been struck by how much they appreciate the importance of the card in their business and in their future digital business opportunity. And so we've been optimistic for what this partnership can be. At the moment, financially, the partnership is dominated by the economics of the back book portfolio that we acquired and that's fully integrated and that's performing as expected. And we have been working very hard with Walmart to put in place the elements and the channels and the opportunities for originations. COVID-19 coming along is a bit of a challenge in the middle of this, and so probably that business will, like all of our businesses, probably be subject to some of the demand impacts and changes that I mentioned relative to what typically happens in a downturn. But we're still very focused on moving forward with them. And what I'm struck by also is the -- we take the very same perspectives on how to manage credit in this environment, where to find the opportunities. And so we'll be continuing to move forward.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, just wanted to turn to the outlook for the reserve you went through very detailed segment by segment, which is very much appreciated. Wanted to understand, how you think about that reserve as we -- as the next couple of quarters unfold. I realize the 9.5% peak unemployment is 2Q 2020, but that you put the qualitative overlays on. So how much more unemployment do you feel like you've baked into the current reserve level just so we can get a sense as to when we see the numbers come out, how we should be flexing future reserve builds, if any?\nScott Blackley: Hey, Betsy, thanks for the question. I think that the -- I would start off by saying the reserve -- when we topped up the reserve at the end of the quarter, we actually didn't go and do another model run. We just did an overlay. So I can't get too precise in saying like, 'Hey, here's a specific number that I would tie to our reserve in terms of unemployment level.' And just in general, in terms of how to think about the reserve going forward, I would just say that, that may not be quite as simple as just taking the headline unemployment and tying that to the size of the allowance. I just was talking about the fact that we did do this late add to the reserve based on some of the worsening economic forecasts we had. And then the second thing I would just say is that we've got -- I think we're just going to see a lot more data in the next 90 days before we have to close the books again. And thinking about kind of the path of the country's response on the virus, how the consumer is going to react to all the stimulus, and we'll actually also have some credit data by the time we close the books next quarter, which, of course, we're going to use all those things to refine our allowance estimate. So at this point, I'd really like to see that data before I speculate on where the allowance might be added.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you. So Scott, thanks for the color on the reserve build. I mean, if I look at your allowance, my personal view is that you guys took a more conservative approach, so we appreciate that. I think some of the card issuers may have a bigger reserve build next quarter. But Rich, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about loan growth and what your plans are in cards. I know, if I go back to the credit crisis, your loan growth declined significantly. And can you just provide some thoughts on stimulus in terms of what the offset might be and how we could think about that?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Thanks, Don. So the first thing that I think is striking -- well, from my experience across several downturns and then thinking about how to interpret this downturn, of course, we haven't seen anything as precipitous as this particular one. But a couple of things tend to naturally happen in cards. The lower purchase volume, obviously, very striking, particularly in this downturn at this point, but lower demand for credit, lower requests for credit line increases, and I want to pause on that because I think there is a intuitive logic people would think, well, wait a minute. When customers feel the strain of a downturn, surely, a lot of them have to be beating a path to try to get more credit. And what I've seen in the past and what we're already seeing here is that consumer behavior tends to be in general one of battening down the hatches a bit, being more conservative, increasing their savings if they have an opportunity to do that, sometimes paying down debt. Now, obviously, there's a huge gradient across customers. But I just wanted to say that our expectation and what we're seeing in a matter of weeks is something that is left on the demand side, and I think -- I would guess that during the period when consumers feel a lot of uncertainty, I think that at least for that period of time that demand will be less. It's also really quite plausible that as things settle out on the other side, consumers will still carry that cautiousness with them. We saw some of that after the Great Recession that there were some behavioral changes in that particular case. Then I want to overlay on top of that what we're doing at Capital One. We're making here very, very early and into the, sort of, free fall period of the economy. We're making choices that are right out of our playbook in downturns and certainly, I think, make a lot of sense of this downturn, tightening our extension of new credit to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. And then we're also pulling back on near-term marketing in response to the decreased opportunity at this very moment for quality growth. And, of course, the decreased marketing has a bit of a -- that will itself flow into a little bit on the growth side. So the combination of these natural trends and our actions put downward pressure on loan balances. Now, I really want to stress that this is a moment in time and this is how the market's reacting, the consumer is reacting and the choices we're making at this moment in time. We have really structured our business and our playbooks to be always testing and looking for inflection points and to see where the opportunities can come and we will pounce on them when they do. One other thing, I want to say is, it's not like there's going to be a single inflection point and then suddenly sort of the -- the sun is going to come out. The way opportunities will emerge, will be probably really quite sloped by product area. We found, across business lines, the sort of inflection point varied by many, many months in our business. And then it will vary by segment, probably by geography. So right now, it's the time to be cautious. And -- but we're very, very closely monitoring where opportunities and -- where and when opportunities will present themselves.\nJeff Norris: Do you have a follow-up Don? Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Hope you guys are doing well. Rich, you talked about pulling back on marketing, and obviously, that wasn't as evident in the first quarter. But when we think about magnitude that you could pull back on marketing and even other expenses, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about it over the course of the period that we're going to experience this weakness as a result of COVID-19?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Let me talk about the -- let me start with the marketing first. So right now, we're pulling back in a number of areas to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. So these areas include some pullbacks in digital and online origination channels, direct mail; on the advertising side, certain product-oriented national advertising. At the same -- we're continuing to originate through some channels. We are -- but we're also continuing to invest in our brand, although the overall brand investment is down, and we are at full levels of marketing on our national banking side. In fact, the whole -- most of the things that are going on, the incredible importance of digital banking experiences the -- just about all of the trends are sort of consistent with an acceleration and the kind of things, we\u2019ve been looking towards consumer behavior relative to our national bank. So we\u2019re -- saw a green light on that one. So and again, I am talking moment in time and these things are lines of coming calls like I have always said, so this is not -- these are not predictions of sustained set of choices we\u2019re making. I am just sharing with you the choices that we are making in this particular phase of this downturn. So relative to expenses overall and we have wonderful momentum in our company, and in our businesses and in our tax transformation. So the very immediate choices are more around choices of credit risk in the margin, the marketing that we're doing, we are tightening up on hiring and tightly managing operating expenses as we continue to monitor the trajectory and character of this downturn.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And I appreciate slide 16, which goes through some of the commercial oil and gas portfolio exposures. But I don't know, Scott, if you could just help us think through the sensitivities around this, because we're hearing all sorts of stuff happening with the price of oil. Maybe if you could help us think about how that sort of translates into this. And also, there were lots of news articles about hedging and derivative contracts and how it affects you. Maybe you could just clear the air on that as well. Thank you.\nScott Blackley: Sure. Thanks, Sanjay. So just starting off on E&P. On -- or excuse me, the energy business. So that business you see in the slides is really predominantly an exploration and production business. And when we did the allowance, we based a lot of the allowance on where the revenue stream that those producers are going to have, which is basically the forward oil prices. And even with this near -- the short-term disruption, that was all about spot prices and not so much about the longer-term prices. So I wouldn't get too worried about kind of that short-term disruption in the market. Overall, when I look at that industry and where we are and what is going on with just the incredible reduction in the use of oil and gas, I would just say this. When we set this reserve up, the significant portion of it, we added some non-specific reserves, these aren't reserves associated with specific names that are struggling. We did a pretty healthy amount of qualitative reserves, just based on the risk of a number of these names just continuing to struggle. So I feel pretty good about the level that we put in there in spite of everything that we've seen in the last several weeks. And then moving on to your other questions about kind of what is going on with the commodities. So Capital One has a business which does some commodities trading on behalf of our customers. And our net exposure to commodity price risk is de minimis. We did ask the CFTC for a temporary relief from being designated as a major swap participant, which is the lowest level in that regulatory hierarchy. And we did that mainly because there could be some -- the price volatility could move some of our positions into levels that would trigger that registration. And we really do appreciate the speed that the CFTC granted relief for us and against not having to necessarily register. However, because the request was really broadly misunderstood in the marketplace, we did notify the CFTC that we're not going to rely on that waiver, and we're going to go ahead and register if derivative volumes reach the threshold that would require us to register. I just have a couple of other comments there. So, one, our commercial bank does not engage in speculative derivative trading. Since 2015, we've provided, as I said, commodity price hedges as a service to our oil and gas customers. And then when we do these trades, we basically have back-to-back trades. We enter into a trade with our customer and we enter into an offsetting trade with Wall Street, and so we're really sitting here in a very low-risk position. And I would just say, at the moment, there's no outstanding margin calls. We reduced our risk exposure to commodities essentially to zero. And you can look in our 10-Ks and Qs and see that this is normal hedging activities. And if there's any updates there on that, we'll point that out there. But hopefully, that clears the air there.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me okay there?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay, great. Thanks. So, also on a credit question. As we think about the reserve adequacy in the card segment, if you -- I know that you indicated that it's, I think, only reserving for the proportion of the COVID-19 programs in what you actually bear the risk. But is the loss content in those programs significantly different than it is in your overall portfolio such that it will significantly skew that ratio in some way?\nScott Blackley: I think that Eric, the thing I would just say there, so one, the loss sharing in those arrangements, we only recognize in our allowance and in our charge-offs our portion of the loss, and some of these loss sharing arrangements, we've talked about that the Walmart loss sharing arrangement includes significant loss sharing. And so as a consequence, we -- it really does decrease the amount of coverage that is necessary required to cover our portion of those losses. So, while the book itself may have losses that are appropriately reflective of the types of customers that are in there, we end up having a much smaller portion of losses that we recognize and our coverage levels are appropriately lower given that relationship.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, maybe to reframe some of the questions that had been posed. I mean, I think one of the things that the investment community is struggling with is that subsequent to the close of the quarter, I think saw economic conditions and expectations have continued to deteriorate. And so in that context, again, like how should we think directionally about the adequacy of reserves across the different products? Is there a greater likelihood of needing to do another true-up under the position, forward-looking economic expectations? Or do you feel like you had a lot -- a good enough look into April trends such that the first quarter's provision really compensated a lot of that already?\nScott Blackley: Well, we did -- I mentioned this, we did make some adjustments to our modeled reserve as we closed the books in the first week of April. I really want to just emphasize that I -- we have certainly seen some scenarios, particularly economic scenarios that are more severe than what we modeled. But on the other hand, we've seen more stimulus that's been brought to bear since then as well. And I said this earlier, but I really think that we -- it is very hard for us to predict where this -- the allowance might be headed. There's such an important relationship of government stimulus and hardship programs that really are going to work to help offset some of the economic challenges that we're seeing right now. And I just -- I don't have a good sense about the allowance going to be bigger or smaller. I really just want to see a little bit more data before we have a lean in either direction.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Can everyone here me?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, we can Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening, everyone. So maybe one question and a follow-up for me. So Rich, if you look, the stock's trading at a $30 discount to tangible capital since this pandemic began on concerns that this could obviously end up eating into the capital base of the company. When I look, your 12% CET1 is amongst the highest in the industry even after building significant reserves. So when you just think about -- I know it's hard to predict at this time, but when you think about the different range of outcomes, combined with the fact that you're halting buybacks, the balance sheet sounds like it's going to be shrinking, how do you think about capital and capital progression in this kind of environment?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, Ryan, I think we entered this downturn, I think about the choices that we have made over the years and coming from the sort of risk management philosophy that deepened in the way this company is founded and even a number of choices that were made over the last few years, and I think we enter this downturn in a really good position. And Ryan, would it be useful possibly to the aperture of your question and sort of compare -- do a little bit of a calibration about going through the Great Recession and calibrate to how I feel about this time around? Not that we can predict this downturn, but in other words though, just thoughts about that experience and comparing some of the resilience dynamics, would that be helpful in -- my question?\nRyan Nash: Well, my follow-up question was actually going to be, and I think everybody is kind of alluding to this on this call, the fact that as we see unemployment reach certain levels, there's an underlying assumption that losses are going to rise to similar amounts. So I actually think it would be helpful for you to compare and contrast this to the financial crisis. What's different? And what are the factors, whether it's the card Act or anything else that's changed across the industry that you think will make those relationships no longer hold?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So knowing, of course, that this particular downturn is so early, nobody knows how prolonged this will be, how severe it will be, what the recovery will look like, or how much government support and forbearance there will be and how it mitigates the economic effects. So with those caveats, let me talk a little bit about the marketplace as we entered the downturn, some of the things on both sides of the ledger at -- in terms of resilience levers and opportunities and then -- so let me start with the marketplace. Let me start with the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer is in much better shape than at the outset of the Great Recession. Consumer debt levels are lower on a per capita basis. Payment obligations are lower still, supported by low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years is double what it was before the Great Recession. And we're not dealing with a structural problem in the economy like the housing sector pre-Great Recession that had to work itself out over multiple years before we could see a sustained recovery. In corporate markets, as we've mentioned in earnings calls over the last few years, there are some mounting, kind of, competitive challenges, including higher debt levels, lower interest coverage, weaker covenants, all of which feel weaker than before the Great Recession. On the other hand, the banks have been a smaller part of this trend and increasing leverage, with capital markets and non-banks taking an increasing share of this growth. At Capital One, we weathered the Great Recession very well and demonstrated the resilience of our business model. Today, we have a stronger capital position and a stronger liquidity position than we had going into the last crisis. And let me comment briefly about each of our major lending businesses. There are some offsetting factors that impact the resilience of our card business relative to the last downturn. The Card Act has leveled the playing field but it has negatively impacted resilience by banning the repricing of existing balances. And changes to accounting rules now dramatically amplify the volatility of allowance, although this doesn't change the underlying resilience of our lending portfolios. And, of course, there, we're talking about both FAS 166, 167 and CECL. And our returns, while still very strong are somewhat lower than they were prior to the Great Recession. We have changed the mix of our portfolio, reducing our exposure to high balance revolvers and significantly growing our spender business at the top of the market and building a stronger customer franchise across the portfolio. And we built loss sharing into most of our partnership deals, which improves our resilience. In the auto business, we have lower charge-offs, higher returns, a strong franchise built one deep dealer relationship at a time and a more resilient strategy. Our commercial business did exceptionally well in the Great Recession, but was aided by a business mix and a geography that did not get severely impacted during the downturn. Our commercial portfolio was still in a developing stage in '08. It looks pretty different today. We've exited or reduced exposure to several less resilient segments like small ticket commercial mortgages and equipment finance. We've invested in building specialty businesses to generate better risk-adjusted returns. And we've increased noncredit revenues significantly. But we think the overall commercial sector is in worse shape as companies have taken on more debt and increased leverage. And the creditor protections have gotten weaker and borrowers have used more aggressive add-backs to inflate earnings. Now again, that's not mostly a description of what's happened to bank lending, but really to lending in the broader marketplace, which, of course, impacts banks as well. Of course, no two downturns are the same and we get to look at the Great Recession in hindsight, and that's of course, 2020. At this point, we know very little about how the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts will play out. We know, of course, that the onset was more abrupt and that the initial worsening is likely to be steeper, faster and deeper. We also know that the downturn is being met with a more rapid and much bigger fiscal -- particularly, fiscal and monetary intervention, the largest fiscal intervention we've seen since the Great Depression. We know that forbearance is available to customers on a much greater scale than it was last time around. So our strategy in the face of the current challenges and uncertainties is to aggressively manage credit and resilience from a decision-making point of view because downside risks can be nonlinear. We take a very cautious approach at this very moment, while the economy is descending. Also though, while very proactively positioning for opportunities that may emerge on the other side of this, and that's why we've said we're tightening our extension of new credit with a real eye toward the probably high adverse selection that would be -- is prevailing out there and pulling back on near-term marketing, tightly managing expenses and being really ready to be responsive as this downturn evolves and knowing that we need to evaluate that on a segment-by-segment basis across our business. So pulling way up, Ryan, we feel really good about the choices that we made over the years. We feel very good across liquidity capital and credit resilience choices as we entered the downturn. With the tech transformation, we've been able to have a company that can move very quickly. And I feel very good about where we are. It's hard to predict exactly what will happen here. But I think the choice is I wouldn't change just about any -- I really wouldn't change any of the choices. Knowing where we are now, I would not change the choices we made leading up to this and I really like our chances.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Maybe Rich or Scott, could you give us just a little bit of a little more detail about the specific forbearance programs that you have in card and auto? In particular, how long they might last and what the take-up has been in terms of -- has it peaked? Can you talk a little bit about that in a little more detail?\nRich Fairbank: Yes, Moshe. So for card customers who enroll, we are allowing them to just give one payment with no late fee on a month-to-month basis. Interest continues to accrue. And as of April 17, as we said, 1% of active accounts have received assistance, representing 2% of balances. For auto, customers can skip one to two payments with initial interest continuing to accrue and payments added to the end of the loan. And I want to comment there. When I say things are monthly or every two months, this is not like that's their only chance, but we wanted to give ourselves more flexibility to evaluate the situation, knowing how fast things are changing. But it's certainly likely that customers who are on a monthly program will be extended if the opportunity calls for that. And as we've said before, as of April 17, 9% of customers have received assistance, representing 11% of balances. It's striking as we look between auto and card how much higher the requests are on the auto side. And I think that while it's striking, I don't think it's necessarily surprising. We have found, in fact, across our businesses if a -- you can see visually that the size of the payment amount is a key driver of the number of requests that we get. And of course, auto payments are typically much higher than credit card minimum payments. And the other reason, of course, is that in auto, the stakes are higher for the customer. They're very motivated to make sure that they can keep their car.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got you. And as a follow-up, maybe could you just talk a little bit about -- you talked about the things you're doing to tighten in the card business. Any changes that you would either think about making or see within the industry with respect to competitiveness of rewards and the kind of products you might see as we -- the next several quarters as we kind of put -- one hopes come out of this process.\nRichard Fairbank: Well, I think we -- the rewards marketplace was very competitive in terms of offers and early spend bonus and things like that, but it kind of settled out into an equilibrium. With purchase volumes down and probably for most card issuers, some tightening up in this very moment. I don't think we would -- I think that I would expect the competitiveness to be, in terms of products and product offers, to be probably stable. The intensity of the competition is probably going to lighten up just probably because people are going to cut back on marketing. And certain of the products, when you think about it, for the reward industry and for Capital One, are oriented towards the things that people aren't able to do right now; travel, entertainment, dining, and a lot of things like that. So, I think that this will be a period where I think issuers will be focused on meeting the needs of their customers and be planning for opportunities when things change. And opportunities can emerge much sooner than the entire economy recovering. Again, as I said, this is a segment by segment and situation by situation kind of thing. So, we're already working to figure out where opportunities, individual opportunities can be there, possibly even that have become bigger opportunities because of the situation the world is in.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache: Good evening. We've seen other banks this quarter generally set their reserves at levels sufficient to cover about 50% on average of cumulative losses contemplated in their severely adverse scenarios under DFAST. Can you share any thoughts on why you guys might differ on this metric?\nScott Blackley: Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. So, obviously, there are different scenarios, that's a starting point. I won't go into all of the differences there. But just kind of a few points as you think about, if you're calibrating us against others. The first is that when you think about our allowance versus the way the Fed models DFAST, one of the issues that impacts that comparison is that the Fed uses industry average recovery rates. And as I mentioned last quarter, our practice is to work recoveries, which results in a longer tail, and that's really important under CECL because in CECL, you take the undiscounted recoveries as an allowance offset. So our CECL recoveries, I believe, are going to be quite a bit higher versus the Fed and their industry average recovery rates. The second point I would make is that when these partnerships that we talked about that have loss sharing arrangements, that meaningfully reduces the losses that are attributable to Capital One. And we only have to allow for our portion of those losses in our allowance and in our provision. And so that is how we do our resilience and modeling processes. While we don't have visibility into the Fed modeling approaches, I don't think that the Fed necessarily gives us credit in DFAST for that offset because they've historically not collected all the data necessary to make those adjustments. So just a couple of factors that you should consider in terms of how we sit relative to others.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Good afternoon. Thank you taking my questions. First one is, I'm just -- I'm trying to think through how stimulus might be different this time. I mean, if you think about it, there was some information put out in the Wall Street Journal today that for a lower income worker stimulus, to the extent they have unemployment, either is a pay increase for a period of time for them, whereas for a prime consumer undergoing unemployment and receiving benefits of the CARES Act, it's still a substantial decrease in compensation for a while. How do you guys think through that in terms of relative performance in your non-prime book versus your prime book this go around?\nRichard Fairbank: John, the -- I think the -- what's striking about the fiscal stimulus here, where there are many things probably striking to all of us about it. But when we've gone back and specifically calibrated to the Great Recession, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I was struck by the fact that the benefits for those who get like unemployment benefits, the unemployment benefits are higher. It's across the -- across a range of relevant incomes, the entire line is higher and the eligibility is significantly higher. So those two things are -- it's hard to quantify how much of an impact that will be because no one can quantify how much of an impact it was the last time. But intuitively, I think that effect can have quite a bit of impact in a good way on people's ability to weather their individual storms and make it to the other side. With respect to subprime versus prime, the first thing I always say is, I think if I showed you the -- by income, if I -- prime or you take, prime and subprime, you've got at the top of the market, there tends to be some very high income folks. But I think you would be surprised that there's not as much slope as one might think relative to things like income on -- across our business as you move along the credit spectrum. There is some slope, but not all that much. All of that said, though, the fact that I think the government is working hard to create a safety net for people who don't necessarily have all of the buffers some people might have in life and the fact that that net is extending wider and broader -- or deeper, I think that that will -- should have a pretty positive benefit for consumers and their ability to, among other things, pay their bills and their credit card bills. And I do want to say that while it's only a small number of days of data, we could see in our payment rate, some -- a spike-up around the time -- those individual checks were coming in. So that could be a short-term thing, but that would be confirmatory of the intuition that we would have.\nJohn Hecht: Okay, that's very helpful color. And then a separate question is tied to the stay-at-home situation or have you seen any different types of behavioral action, given the  digital bank\u2026\nJeff Norris: Hey, John, I'm sorry. John, I'm sorry to interrupt you. You're breaking up. We can't understand the question. Can you\u2026\nJohn Hecht: You guys hear me now?\nJeff Norris: It's better.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. The question, as we've been on  type of environment for a while, have you seen any behavioral change with respect to interaction with your consumer bank? And -- pretty heavily in that opportunity.\nJeff Norris: John, I'm so sorry. Let's try one more time and then we might have to move on. But\u2026\nRichard Fairbank: Well, John, were you saying -- given that we've invested heavily on our consumer bank in terms of the digital side of the business, are we seeing anything particular there? Would that be close to the question that you have?\nJohn Hecht: Yes, particularly given that we're stay-at-home situation and you're going to have a greater opportunity to interact with the digital -- over the digital channel.\nRichard Fairbank: Well, an interesting thing is, we are probably in the best position in America to have a calibration about -- because we not only have a digital bank, we also have a branch-based bank in some of our geographies as well, and so we certainly can see the calibration. There is -- look, the first thing I would say is there certainly are a core of customers who still need and want to -- well, they very much want to use the bank, and we've been able to keep most of our branches open by -- like 75% of them by having drive-through and some glass windows for some social separation. So we've certainly seen a continued volume there. But if I pull up, I think that this moment is some people say they predict, gosh, people will have very different behaviors on the other side of this moment. I'll make a different prediction. I think this is going to be an accelerant to the behaviors that we were all, as a society, heading for anyway. And the advantage, I think, that the banks who have really driven their customers to digital and built the capabilities that can help a customer pretty much do everything digitally, It was always where the world's going, but I think it's just an acceleration of -- the bell curve shifted in terms of, I think, the number of folks. This is me talking more intuitively than empirically. But this is why I said earlier when I talked about, we're going to keep our foot on the gas with respect to the marketing and the investment in our national banking strategy because, of course, what that is -- as I've often called it, we're trying to build the bank of the future. And I think that years in the evolution of America and consumer behavior possibly just got compressed here.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.\nRick Shane: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Two questions. First, in the past, you talked about a 25 basis point benefit from the loss sharing in the Walmart agreement throughout 2020. I'm wondering if there's any cap on that or how much we could expect that to flex as charge-offs rise related to COVID-19?\nRichard Blackley: Hey Rick, how are you. Look, as you think about Walmart, we did talk about a 25 basis point impact to delinquencies and on an ongoing basis, about that same level going forward. And I think that there's -- yes, we could absolutely see variability in the impact of that to the total, just given movements in the loss rates of either part of that calculation. I would anticipate them to be relatively small because the loss sharing is so significant with Walmart, but it's -- it could move up a bit and still not really impact our overall loss rate all that much. But there's not a cap in the contract, if by chance, you were asking that, so this loss share is on a percentage basis and it will stay that way.\nRick Shane: Okay, great. And then, Rich for you, look, you're a serious student of human behavior. And I'm curious what you have seen in terms of consumer behavior so far that has surprised you the most.\nRich Fairbank: I'm not sure anything has been surprising, I'm certainly struck by. Here's the thing that's interesting about this particular downturn. Almost all other downturns -- most other downturns have the following characteristics. They kind of happen on little cat feet and then things start picking up, but it's a slow kind of descent into that. And the other thing is, so often, there are structural problems. This is an economy point, but structural problems in market that sort of bleed to that. And then the resolution of it needs to fix those structural problems on the way to fixing all the other problems that come from it. So I think what's so extraordinary about this is the just swiftness of this thing and the fact that it's really the entire world going through this and the sort of vertical descent from an economy point of view, that happened so quickly. So things that I'm struck by on the consumer behavior side, I have been really struck at the early behaviors that I see that are consistent with the model that we have believed -- in fact, let me back up for a second and say, there's a saying that I used to -- that I've said for years, is that consumers are a lot more rational than the institutions who serve them, including the financial institution who's served them often over the years. I have always been struck over the years, despite all the things that are written and speculated about consumers, just how rational they are. And so I was struck during the Great Recession at their rationality. There was some irrationality before the Great Recession. This time around, the consumer was in a solid, very balanced shape going into this downturn. And the little things that I have seen, behaviors on the savings side, on our bank side, behaviors on the payment side, the purchase volume side, even on the delinquency side of things, and what I see is a rational consumer and I think that what we all should think about as we calibrate to any other recession. This is a downturn that came to the whole world right at once and it's a downturn without a bad guy. That's the other part of this thing. And so what's the implications of a downturn without a bad guy is it's a lot easier politically to mobilize solutions. For consumers, that's a political and economic point, but I think that is going to be a good guy in this downturn and its resilience. The other thing -- the other final thing I'll say about human behavior or the behavior that we've certainly seen, I am amazed, I'll talk about our company. This is really a point about consumers; it's a point about people. I am amazed how productive people are, and we just did an associate, it's an all associate survey and engagement and morale is still at very high levels. People are all in, they're engaged, and the productivity is extraordinary from people working from home. It doesn't mean that everybody, when the world opens up, everybody is going to just stay home. But I think that back to my earlier point, I think there's a compression in years in the learnings and the behaviors associated with digital. And I think every company's going to walk away from this experience struck by the extraordinary productivity that -- or certainly most companies or certainly ones that are digitally in a good position by what just happened on the productivity side and that is some learnings for all of us there.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: I know the call's gone long, but just on the OpEx, totally understand pulling the target, given how much flux there is. But on the core effort of moving to the cloud and retiring the data centers, is any part of that core expense dollar effort and timing changed? Or is it more just revenues in flux, maybe some call center volumes and stuff like that? Has the data center strategy changed at all, I guess, is the crux of the question?\nRichard Fairbank: No, not a single bit. I mean, we are incredibly well served by our move to the cloud, the ability to scale up for some extraordinary things that have happened, so many things. So, the cloud strategy, the technology transformation, everything about it, we felt this experience is validating. With respect to the data center exit itself; we are on the very same timing of later this year. I mean, we are already fully in the cloud. So, what -- but the data centers are still open because there is -- you think once you get out, well, then you just -- you're done but there is a period of much of a year to actually do all the wind down activities associated with the data center. So, we're 100% in the cloud, and the wind down is going right on schedule and we're talking later this year and the associated economic benefit of those moves.\nJeff Norris: Okay. Well, I think that wraps it up for this evening. Thank you for staying with us. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be available later this evening to answer any further questions. Have a great evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. Before we get into first quarter results, I'll begin tonight with an overview of COVID-19 and its impact. In roughly the last two weeks of the first quarter, the world changed abruptly as the spread of COVID-19 accelerated. Like all of you, we're watching with empathy and gratitude as people and communities take extraordinary action, care for the sick, support first responders and slow the transmission of the virus. At Capital One, we're focused on the well-being of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve, and we've fully mobilized to do our part to make an immediate positive impact. Enabled by our technology transformation, about 80% of our associates and 98% of our non-branch associates smoothly transitioned to remote working arrangements and are now securely and productively working from home. For our associates who must be at Capital One location, we've taken steps to improve social distancing, adopted flexible attendance and leave policies and increased hourly pay. For our customers, we're offering a range of forbearance options and taking steps to make it easier for banking customers to access their money while social distancing. Thanks, Scott. This quarter, there is an obvious recurring theme in each of our businesses and for the company. First quarter results reflect two distinct time periods: January 1st through mid-March before COVID-19 impacts took hold; and the last two weeks of the quarter when COVID-19 drove sharp changes in many metrics and trends. Pre-COVID-19 results generally show solid momentum and strong performance on growth, credit and efficiency that have put Capital One in a strong position. Post-COVID-19 trends show a clear inflection, but there's too much uncertainty to simply extrapolate recent trends. With that context, I'll pick up on slide 10, which summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business. Pre-provision results were solid in the first quarter, with continued year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volumes. Credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business, which is shown on Slide 11. Domestic card ending loan balances increased 8.4% year-over-year, driven by the addition of the acquired Walmart portfolio. The emergence of COVID-19 impacts late in the quarter caused a deceleration in the growth of ending loan balance. First quarter average loans grew 11% year-over-year. First quarter purchase volume was up 8% from the first quarter of 2019, with strong growth through most of the quarter partially offset by sharp declines near the end of the quarter. By the end of the first quarter, weekly purchase volume was running at a year-over-year decline of about 30%. Consistent with industry trends, our largest declines were in travel and entertainment, restaurants and discretionary retail. These category decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending at supermarkets and discount stores. Through April 17, weekly purchase volume continues to be down about 30% year-over-year. Revenue increased 2% year-over-year. Growth in average loans was offset by lower revenue margin. The revenue margin declined 129 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. So, Betsy, good evening. The Walmart integration has really happened. And so we have a wonderful working partnership with Walmart, really exceptional. And they -- I've been struck by how much they appreciate the importance of the card in their business and in their future digital business opportunity. And so we've been optimistic for what this partnership can be. At the moment, financially, the partnership is dominated by the economics of the back book portfolio that we acquired and that's fully integrated and that's performing as expected. And we have been working very hard with Walmart to put in place the elements and the channels and the opportunities for originations. COVID-19 coming along is a bit of a challenge in the middle of this, and so probably that business will, like all of our businesses, probably be subject to some of the demand impacts and changes that I mentioned relative to what typically happens in a downturn. But we're still very focused on moving forward with them. And what I'm struck by also is the -- we take the very same perspectives on how to manage credit in this environment, where to find the opportunities. And so we'll be continuing to move forward. Yes. Thanks, Don. So the first thing that I think is striking -- well, from my experience across several downturns and then thinking about how to interpret this downturn, of course, we haven't seen anything as precipitous as this particular one. But a couple of things tend to naturally happen in cards. The lower purchase volume, obviously, very striking, particularly in this downturn at this point, but lower demand for credit, lower requests for credit line increases, and I want to pause on that because I think there is a intuitive logic people would think, well, wait a minute. When customers feel the strain of a downturn, surely, a lot of them have to be beating a path to try to get more credit. And what I've seen in the past and what we're already seeing here is that consumer behavior tends to be in general one of battening down the hatches a bit, being more conservative, increasing their savings if they have an opportunity to do that, sometimes paying down debt. Now, obviously, there's a huge gradient across customers. But I just wanted to say that our expectation and what we're seeing in a matter of weeks is something that is left on the demand side, and I think -- I would guess that during the period when consumers feel a lot of uncertainty, I think that at least for that period of time that demand will be less. It's also really quite plausible that as things settle out on the other side, consumers will still carry that cautiousness with them. We saw some of that after the Great Recession that there were some behavioral changes in that particular case. Then I want to overlay on top of that what we're doing at Capital One. We're making here very, very early and into the, sort of, free fall period of the economy. We're making choices that are right out of our playbook in downturns and certainly, I think, make a lot of sense of this downturn, tightening our extension of new credit to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. And then we're also pulling back on near-term marketing in response to the decreased opportunity at this very moment for quality growth. And, of course, the decreased marketing has a bit of a -- that will itself flow into a little bit on the growth side. So the combination of these natural trends and our actions put downward pressure on loan balances. Now, I really want to stress that this is a moment in time and this is how the market's reacting, the consumer is reacting and the choices we're making at this moment in time. We have really structured our business and our playbooks to be always testing and looking for inflection points and to see where the opportunities can come and we will pounce on them when they do. One other thing, I want to say is, it's not like there's going to be a single inflection point and then suddenly sort of the -- the sun is going to come out. The way opportunities will emerge, will be probably really quite sloped by product area. We found, across business lines, the sort of inflection point varied by many, many months in our business. And then it will vary by segment, probably by geography. So right now, it's the time to be cautious. And -- but we're very, very closely monitoring where opportunities and -- where and when opportunities will present themselves. Yes. Let me talk about the -- let me start with the marketing first. So right now, we're pulling back in a number of areas to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection. So these areas include some pullbacks in digital and online origination channels, direct mail; on the advertising side, certain product-oriented national advertising. At the same -- we're continuing to originate through some channels. We are -- but we're also continuing to invest in our brand, although the overall brand investment is down, and we are at full levels of marketing on our national banking side. In fact, the whole -- most of the things that are going on, the incredible importance of digital banking experiences the -- just about all of the trends are sort of consistent with an acceleration and the kind of things, we've been looking towards consumer behavior relative to our national bank. So we're -- saw a green light on that one. So and again, I am talking moment in time and these things are lines of coming calls like I have always said, so this is not -- these are not predictions of sustained set of choices we're making. I am just sharing with you the choices that we are making in this particular phase of this downturn. So relative to expenses overall and we have wonderful momentum in our company, and in our businesses and in our tax transformation. So the very immediate choices are more around choices of credit risk in the margin, the marketing that we're doing, we are tightening up on hiring and tightly managing operating expenses as we continue to monitor the trajectory and character of this downturn. Yes. Yes, we can Ryan. Well, Ryan, I think we entered this downturn, I think about the choices that we have made over the years and coming from the sort of risk management philosophy that deepened in the way this company is founded and even a number of choices that were made over the last few years, and I think we enter this downturn in a really good position. And Ryan, would it be useful possibly to the aperture of your question and sort of compare -- do a little bit of a calibration about going through the Great Recession and calibrate to how I feel about this time around? Not that we can predict this downturn, but in other words though, just thoughts about that experience and comparing some of the resilience dynamics, would that be helpful in -- my question? Yes. So knowing, of course, that this particular downturn is so early, nobody knows how prolonged this will be, how severe it will be, what the recovery will look like, or how much government support and forbearance there will be and how it mitigates the economic effects. So with those caveats, let me talk a little bit about the marketplace as we entered the downturn, some of the things on both sides of the ledger at -- in terms of resilience levers and opportunities and then -- so let me start with the marketplace. Let me start with the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer is in much better shape than at the outset of the Great Recession. Consumer debt levels are lower on a per capita basis. Payment obligations are lower still, supported by low interest rates. The savings rate over the past few years is double what it was before the Great Recession. And we're not dealing with a structural problem in the economy like the housing sector pre-Great Recession that had to work itself out over multiple years before we could see a sustained recovery. In corporate markets, as we've mentioned in earnings calls over the last few years, there are some mounting, kind of, competitive challenges, including higher debt levels, lower interest coverage, weaker covenants, all of which feel weaker than before the Great Recession. On the other hand, the banks have been a smaller part of this trend and increasing leverage, with capital markets and non-banks taking an increasing share of this growth. At Capital One, we weathered the Great Recession very well and demonstrated the resilience of our business model. Today, we have a stronger capital position and a stronger liquidity position than we had going into the last crisis. And let me comment briefly about each of our major lending businesses. There are some offsetting factors that impact the resilience of our card business relative to the last downturn. The Card Act has leveled the playing field but it has negatively impacted resilience by banning the repricing of existing balances. And changes to accounting rules now dramatically amplify the volatility of allowance, although this doesn't change the underlying resilience of our lending portfolios. And, of course, there, we're talking about both FAS 166, 167 and CECL. And our returns, while still very strong are somewhat lower than they were prior to the Great Recession. We have changed the mix of our portfolio, reducing our exposure to high balance revolvers and significantly growing our spender business at the top of the market and building a stronger customer franchise across the portfolio. And we built loss sharing into most of our partnership deals, which improves our resilience. In the auto business, we have lower charge-offs, higher returns, a strong franchise built one deep dealer relationship at a time and a more resilient strategy. Our commercial business did exceptionally well in the Great Recession, but was aided by a business mix and a geography that did not get severely impacted during the downturn. Our commercial portfolio was still in a developing stage in '08. It looks pretty different today. We've exited or reduced exposure to several less resilient segments like small ticket commercial mortgages and equipment finance. We've invested in building specialty businesses to generate better risk-adjusted returns. And we've increased noncredit revenues significantly. But we think the overall commercial sector is in worse shape as companies have taken on more debt and increased leverage. And the creditor protections have gotten weaker and borrowers have used more aggressive add-backs to inflate earnings. Now again, that's not mostly a description of what's happened to bank lending, but really to lending in the broader marketplace, which, of course, impacts banks as well. Of course, no two downturns are the same and we get to look at the Great Recession in hindsight, and that's of course, 2020. At this point, we know very little about how the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts will play out. We know, of course, that the onset was more abrupt and that the initial worsening is likely to be steeper, faster and deeper. We also know that the downturn is being met with a more rapid and much bigger fiscal -- particularly, fiscal and monetary intervention, the largest fiscal intervention we've seen since the Great Depression. We know that forbearance is available to customers on a much greater scale than it was last time around. So our strategy in the face of the current challenges and uncertainties is to aggressively manage credit and resilience from a decision-making point of view because downside risks can be nonlinear. We take a very cautious approach at this very moment, while the economy is descending. Also though, while very proactively positioning for opportunities that may emerge on the other side of this, and that's why we've said we're tightening our extension of new credit with a real eye toward the probably high adverse selection that would be -- is prevailing out there and pulling back on near-term marketing, tightly managing expenses and being really ready to be responsive as this downturn evolves and knowing that we need to evaluate that on a segment-by-segment basis across our business. So pulling way up, Ryan, we feel really good about the choices that we made over the years. We feel very good across liquidity capital and credit resilience choices as we entered the downturn. With the tech transformation, we've been able to have a company that can move very quickly. And I feel very good about where we are. It's hard to predict exactly what will happen here. But I think the choice is I wouldn't change just about any -- I really wouldn't change any of the choices. Knowing where we are now, I would not change the choices we made leading up to this and I really like our chances. Well, I think we -- the rewards marketplace was very competitive in terms of offers and early spend bonus and things like that, but it kind of settled out into an equilibrium. With purchase volumes down and probably for most card issuers, some tightening up in this very moment. I don't think we would -- I think that I would expect the competitiveness to be, in terms of products and product offers, to be probably stable. The intensity of the competition is probably going to lighten up just probably because people are going to cut back on marketing. And certain of the products, when you think about it, for the reward industry and for Capital One, are oriented towards the things that people aren't able to do right now; travel, entertainment, dining, and a lot of things like that. So, I think that this will be a period where I think issuers will be focused on meeting the needs of their customers and be planning for opportunities when things change. And opportunities can emerge much sooner than the entire economy recovering. Again, as I said, this is a segment by segment and situation by situation kind of thing. So, we're already working to figure out where opportunities, individual opportunities can be there, possibly even that have become bigger opportunities because of the situation the world is in. John, the -- I think the -- what's striking about the fiscal stimulus here, where there are many things probably striking to all of us about it. But when we've gone back and specifically calibrated to the Great Recession, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I was struck by the fact that the benefits for those who get like unemployment benefits, the unemployment benefits are higher. It's across the -- across a range of relevant incomes, the entire line is higher and the eligibility is significantly higher. So those two things are -- it's hard to quantify how much of an impact that will be because no one can quantify how much of an impact it was the last time. But intuitively, I think that effect can have quite a bit of impact in a good way on people's ability to weather their individual storms and make it to the other side. With respect to subprime versus prime, the first thing I always say is, I think if I showed you the -- by income, if I -- prime or you take, prime and subprime, you've got at the top of the market, there tends to be some very high income folks. But I think you would be surprised that there's not as much slope as one might think relative to things like income on -- across our business as you move along the credit spectrum. There is some slope, but not all that much. All of that said, though, the fact that I think the government is working hard to create a safety net for people who don't necessarily have all of the buffers some people might have in life and the fact that that net is extending wider and broader -- or deeper, I think that that will -- should have a pretty positive benefit for consumers and their ability to, among other things, pay their bills and their credit card bills. And I do want to say that while it's only a small number of days of data, we could see in our payment rate, some -- a spike-up around the time -- those individual checks were coming in. So that could be a short-term thing, but that would be confirmatory of the intuition that we would have. Well, John, were you saying -- given that we've invested heavily on our consumer bank in terms of the digital side of the business, are we seeing anything particular there? Would that be close to the question that you have? Well, an interesting thing is, we are probably in the best position in America to have a calibration about -- because we not only have a digital bank, we also have a branch-based bank in some of our geographies as well, and so we certainly can see the calibration. There is -- look, the first thing I would say is there certainly are a core of customers who still need and want to -- well, they very much want to use the bank, and we've been able to keep most of our branches open by -- like 75% of them by having drive-through and some glass windows for some social separation. So we've certainly seen a continued volume there. But if I pull up, I think that this moment is some people say they predict, gosh, people will have very different behaviors on the other side of this moment. I'll make a different prediction. I think this is going to be an accelerant to the behaviors that we were all, as a society, heading for anyway. And the advantage, I think, that the banks who have really driven their customers to digital and built the capabilities that can help a customer pretty much do everything digitally, It was always where the world's going, but I think it's just an acceleration of -- the bell curve shifted in terms of, I think, the number of folks. This is me talking more intuitively than empirically. But this is why I said earlier when I talked about, we're going to keep our foot on the gas with respect to the marketing and the investment in our national banking strategy because, of course, what that is -- as I've often called it, we're trying to build the bank of the future. And I think that years in the evolution of America and consumer behavior possibly just got compressed here. No, not a single bit. I mean, we are incredibly well served by our move to the cloud, the ability to scale up for some extraordinary things that have happened, so many things. So, the cloud strategy, the technology transformation, everything about it, we felt this experience is validating. With respect to the data center exit itself; we are on the very same timing of later this year. I mean, we are already fully in the cloud. So, what -- but the data centers are still open because there is -- you think once you get out, well, then you just -- you're done but there is a period of much of a year to actually do all the wind down activities associated with the data center. So, we're 100% in the cloud, and the wind down is going right on schedule and we're talking later this year and the associated economic benefit of those moves."

Look, as you think about Walmart, we did talk about a 25 basis point impact to delinquencies and on an ongoing basis, about that same level going forward. And I think that there's -- yes, we could absolutely see variability in the impact of that to the total, just given movements in the loss rates of either part of that calculation. I would anticipate them to be relatively small because the loss sharing is so significant with Walmart, but it's -- it could move up a bit and still not really impact our overall loss rate all that much. But there's not a cap in the contract, if by chance, you were asking that, so this loss share is on a percentage basis and it will stay that way."

            "name": "Scott Blackley",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Capital One lost $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share in the first quarter. Net of adjusting items, our EPS loss in the quarter was $3.02, driven by a $3.6 billion allowance build. Turning to Slide 4, I'll cover the allowance in more detail. The adoption of CECL increased our allowance by $2.8 billion, as of January 1, 2020, in line with previously communicated expectations. Our first quarter allowance build of $3.6 billion consists of $2.2 billion in card, approximately $600 million in auto and approximately $700 million in commercial. We modeled several economic scenarios and then we added some judgmental overlays in determining our allowance. The most heavily weighted of these economic scenarios included a sharp increase to a peak unemployment during Q2 2020 of 9.5%, followed by an improvement into 2021. I would encourage you not to get too focused on the headline unemployment rate because it was just one of the many variables impacting our allowance. Hey, Betsy, thanks for the question. I think that the -- I would start off by saying the reserve -- when we topped up the reserve at the end of the quarter, we actually didn't go and do another model run. We just did an overlay. So I can't get too precise in saying like, 'Hey, here's a specific number that I would tie to our reserve in terms of unemployment level.' And just in general, in terms of how to think about the reserve going forward, I would just say that, that may not be quite as simple as just taking the headline unemployment and tying that to the size of the allowance. I just was talking about the fact that we did do this late add to the reserve based on some of the worsening economic forecasts we had. And then the second thing I would just say is that we've got -- I think we're just going to see a lot more data in the next 90 days before we have to close the books again. And thinking about kind of the path of the country's response on the virus, how the consumer is going to react to all the stimulus, and we'll actually also have some credit data by the time we close the books next quarter, which, of course, we're going to use all those things to refine our allowance estimate. So at this point, I'd really like to see that data before I speculate on where the allowance might be added. Sure. Thanks, Sanjay. So just starting off on E&P. On -- or excuse me, the energy business. So that business you see in the slides is really predominantly an exploration and production business. And when we did the allowance, we based a lot of the allowance on where the revenue stream that those producers are going to have, which is basically the forward oil prices. And even with this near -- the short-term disruption, that was all about spot prices and not so much about the longer-term prices. So I wouldn't get too worried about kind of that short-term disruption in the market. Overall, when I look at that industry and where we are and what is going on with just the incredible reduction in the use of oil and gas, I would just say this. When we set this reserve up, the significant portion of it, we added some non-specific reserves, these aren't reserves associated with specific names that are struggling. We did a pretty healthy amount of qualitative reserves, just based on the risk of a number of these names just continuing to struggle. So I feel pretty good about the level that we put in there in spite of everything that we've seen in the last several weeks. And then moving on to your other questions about kind of what is going on with the commodities. So Capital One has a business which does some commodities trading on behalf of our customers. And our net exposure to commodity price risk is de minimis. We did ask the CFTC for a temporary relief from being designated as a major swap participant, which is the lowest level in that regulatory hierarchy. And we did that mainly because there could be some -- the price volatility could move some of our positions into levels that would trigger that registration. And we really do appreciate the speed that the CFTC granted relief for us and against not having to necessarily register. However, because the request was really broadly misunderstood in the marketplace, we did notify the CFTC that we're not going to rely on that waiver, and we're going to go ahead and register if derivative volumes reach the threshold that would require us to register. I just have a couple of other comments there. So, one, our commercial bank does not engage in speculative derivative trading. Since 2015, we've provided, as I said, commodity price hedges as a service to our oil and gas customers. And then when we do these trades, we basically have back-to-back trades. We enter into a trade with our customer and we enter into an offsetting trade with Wall Street, and so we're really sitting here in a very low-risk position. And I would just say, at the moment, there's no outstanding margin calls. We reduced our risk exposure to commodities essentially to zero. And you can look in our 10-Ks and Qs and see that this is normal hedging activities. And if there's any updates there on that, we'll point that out there. But hopefully, that clears the air there. I think that Eric, the thing I would just say there, so one, the loss sharing in those arrangements, we only recognize in our allowance and in our charge-offs our portion of the loss, and some of these loss sharing arrangements, we've talked about that the Walmart loss sharing arrangement includes significant loss sharing. And so as a consequence, we -- it really does decrease the amount of coverage that is necessary required to cover our portion of those losses. So, while the book itself may have losses that are appropriately reflective of the types of customers that are in there, we end up having a much smaller portion of losses that we recognize and our coverage levels are appropriately lower given that relationship. Well, we did -- I mentioned this, we did make some adjustments to our modeled reserve as we closed the books in the first week of April. I really want to just emphasize that I -- we have certainly seen some scenarios, particularly economic scenarios that are more severe than what we modeled. But on the other hand, we've seen more stimulus that's been brought to bear since then as well. And I said this earlier, but I really think that we -- it is very hard for us to predict where this -- the allowance might be headed. There's such an important relationship of government stimulus and hardship programs that really are going to work to help offset some of the economic challenges that we're seeing right now. And I just -- I don't have a good sense about the allowance going to be bigger or smaller. I really just want to see a little bit more data before we have a lean in either direction. Yes, Bill, thanks for the question. So, obviously, there are different scenarios, that's a starting point. I won't go into all of the differences there. But just kind of a few points as you think about, if you're calibrating us against others. The first is that when you think about our allowance versus the way the Fed models DFAST, one of the issues that impacts that comparison is that the Fed uses industry average recovery rates. And as I mentioned last quarter, our practice is to work recoveries, which results in a longer tail, and that's really important under CECL because in CECL, you take the undiscounted recoveries as an allowance offset. So our CECL recoveries, I believe, are going to be quite a bit higher versus the Fed and their industry average recovery rates. The second point I would make is that when these partnerships that we talked about that have loss sharing arrangements, that meaningfully reduces the losses that are attributable to Capital One. And we only have to allow for our portion of those losses in our allowance and in our provision. And so that is how we do our resilience and modeling processes. While we don't have visibility into the Fed modeling approaches, I don't think that the Fed necessarily gives us credit in DFAST for that offset because they've historically not collected all the data necessary to make those adjustments. So just a couple of factors that you should consider in terms of how we sit relative to others."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.41 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $12.4 billion or $26.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year earnings per share were $27.11. Full year ROTCE was 28.4%.  Included in the results for the fourth quarter was an upgrade to a legacy rewards program, which increased our rewards liability and decreased noninterest income by $92 million. Both period end and average loans held for investment grew 6% on a linked-quarter basis. Ending loans grew 10% in Domestic Card, 7% in Commercial and 1% in Consumer Banking. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4% driven by the loan growth I just described, while total noninterest expense increased 12% in the quarter driven by increases in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $381 million as net charge-offs of $527 million were partially offset by a modest allowance relief .  Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released $145 million of allowance in the fourth quarter, bringing the total allowance balance to $11.4 billion. The total company coverage ratio now stands at 4.12%.  Turning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance of each of our segments in greater detail. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio declined in each of our segments. In Domestic Card, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. The decline in card coverage was driven by the impact of balance growth that I highlighted earlier. In our Consumer Banking segment, continued strength in auto auction values drove a decline in both the allowance balance and the coverage ratio. And in Commercial, the decline in allowance balance was driven by modest credit improvement in the existing portfolio. In addition to the allowance decline, the coverage ratio was also aided by growth in lower loss segments.  Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 139%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. We continue to gradually run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic. Relative to the prior quarter, ending cash and equivalents were down about $5 billion and investment securities were down about $3 billion as we used our liquidity to fund loan growth and share buybacks.  Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. You can see that our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 25 basis points higher than Q3 and 55 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by balance sheet mix as we had a reduction in cash and securities as well as a higher amount of card loans. Outside of quarterly day count effects, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the change in card balances, cash and securities levels and interest rates.  Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock, which completed our $7.5 billion Board authorization. Our Board of Directors has approved an additional repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of the company's common stock.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Accelerating year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.  As you can see on Slide 11, our Domestic Card business posted strong growth in every top line metric in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 29% year-over-year and up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $10.2 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 10% from the sequential quarter, ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 4%. Ending loan growth was the result of the strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account origination and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates, and revenue was up 15% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.  Domestic Card revenue margin increased 123 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth, and favorable year-over-year credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in fourth quarter revenue. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.49%, a 120 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.22%, 20 basis points better than the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 13 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 29 basis points.  Noninterest expense was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The biggest driver of noninterest expense was an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $999 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business and our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to grow and build our franchise.  Moving to Slide 12. Strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the fourth quarter. Driven by auto, fourth quarter ending loans increased 13% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 13%. Fourth quarter auto originations were up 32% year-over-year. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our auto business. In the fourth quarter, we saw a pickup in competitive intensity in the marketplace. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 16%.  Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $6.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 7% from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields. Noninterest expense increased 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $58 million year-over-year driven by an allowance release in our auto business. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.58%, up 40 basis points. And the 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.32%, up 67 basis points.  Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 12% year-over-year driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 8%. Ending deposits grew 13% from the fourth quarter of 2020 as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits also increased 14% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 19% from the prior year quarter with 29% growth in noninterest income. Noninterest expense was up 17%.  Commercial credit performance remains strong. In the fourth quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was a negative 2 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.1%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our Commercial capability.  I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Growth momentum is evident throughout our fourth quarter results. In the quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. We also posted strong auto and Commercial growth. Credit remains strikingly strong across our business and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. As we enter 2022, we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our businesses and build our franchise. We will continue to lean into marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and drive growth.  For years, we've talked about how sweeping digital change and modern technology are changing the game in banking. Last quarter, I noted that the stakes are rising faster than ever before. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. Also, many legacy companies are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue for them and are increasing technology investments. The war for tech talent continues to escalate, which is driving up tech labor costs even before any headcount increase.  All these developments underscore the significant opportunity for players who have modern technology and who are in a position to drive growth. Capital One is very well positioned to do that. We've spent years driving our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were an original fintech, and we have built modern technology, infrastructure and capabilities at scale. And we're investing to leverage these capabilities to grow and to realize the many benefits of our digital transformation.  We have been on a long journey to drive our operating efficiency ratio down. We expect that the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent, on top of our growth investment, will pressure annual operating efficiency in the near term. But these pressures do not change our belief in the longer-term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains.  Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. And it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.  And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. . Justin, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: . And our first question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Rich, I want to kind of circle back to the efficiency ratio comment that you highlighted. I guess if I look at the fourth quarter, it's tough to know how to think about that level of expenses kind of going forward. It's not generally your practice to give specific guidance, but it would really be helpful because in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, it's not just an efficiency ratio that deteriorated, it's actual -- PPNR was down because even though revenues were quite strong, the increase in expenses was more than that in dollars. So is there -- can you talk about are there any gating factors in terms of when you think about expense levels kind of into 2022?\nRichard Fairbank: Moshe, there are a number of different factors going on in the fourth quarter, and maybe Andrew can comment specifically about the fourth quarter. But my point about the efficiency is really -- and some of the factors that were -- that I'm talking about in the efficiency ratio certainly manifested themselves in the fourth quarter. But our real point is that we're on a journey to improve operating efficiency. We've been leaning into this, and we're very optimistic about not only what we've done but what we can continue to do. And we're just flagging the tech talent costs and the continued investment in the opportunity. And that opportunity continues to be toward the top of the tech stack, which translates more into growth opportunities probably than some years ago when our investment began at the bottom of the tech stack. These investments are very important. And our point is that collectively, these things will pressure annual efficiency ratio in the near term, but it's really the same journey and the same drivers of opportunity and efficiency.  Andrew, I don't know if you want to make any comments about the fourth quarter specifically.\nAndrew Young: Sure. Yes. Moshe, you're well aware that we seasonally typically have higher expenses in the quarter, largely driven by the marginal cost of growth. Beyond that normal seasonal pattern, there were a few things that are reflected in this fourth quarter, the first of which is we saw some revenue driven and other incentive compensation. We also chose to make some of the investments, that Rich just described, in the professional services side to help accelerate some of the technology and other project work that Rich is referencing that will drive future growth. And so those couple of factors, some of which will continue as we head into next year. And we're seeing a little bit of the leading edge of the wage pressures so I would expect that to accelerate a bit, but some of the marked-related items in incentive compensation, some of the project work, will likely fall off.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Right. And maybe just as a follow-up, just to talk specifically about marketing, it was just about $1 billion in the quarter. December was the industry's largest month of mail volume in a decade. So you're not alone in that, although the level is fairly high. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how long do you see that -- and I do know that marketing was also typically high for you in the fourth quarter, but it was particularly low in the first half of 2021. How do we think about it as we go into 2022?\nRichard Fairbank: Moshe, it's clear that competition is intense. And you can see from the one you pointed out, direct mail is back at pretty high levels. You can see media advertising increasing throughout 2021. Of course, earnings calls from card players have indicated an expectation of increasing competition. And also in the rewards space, you can see competition is pretty intense there. So we have a very careful eye on that. I would say, though, that even as we have a very careful eye on that, I am struck by how the consumer is in a very good place right now. I think there's some natural growth capacity there. And I'm really struck by the traction that we're getting at Capital One. We continue to see some really good origination opportunities really across our businesses, and we like very much the results that we're seeing.  And the other thing about the competitive intensity at this point is more in upfront investments, such as marketing and upfront bonuses. And at this point, we're not seeing, in the competitive environment, sort of the sacrifices in margin and resilience. I'm talking particularly in the card business there. So we have experience through competitive cycles, and we know what to look for. But we are really pleased by the results, really struck by our opportunity to capitalize on them. And that's why we're leaning in. And that's also why we're flagging, of course, that we have our eyes on the very important issue that you mentioned relative to competition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Rich, I wanted to get a sense from you on the opportunity set that you have in front of you with regard to the loan growth. And I'm asking the question because I get investor questions on, hey, is this revenue -- is this loan growth rate we're seeing right now reflecting peak levels the cycle that we could get. So I would rather hear from you as to what do you think about the loan growth acceleration that you got in the fourth quarter. Was it being driven by in terms of new accounts versus increased line utilizations, increased offers? And what's the legs on this as we go into the next year?\nRichard Fairbank: Betsy, great questions there. So we feel very good about our growth and our growth opportunities that we're seeing right now. Let me start with purchase volume. Obviously, our 29% purchase volume growth was really significant. And we've seen a lot of purchase volume growth across the industry. Of course, that's not just a Capital One effect. But with Capital One, specifically, we are seeing a lot of traction in our various spender programs. We're optimistic about that trajectory.  And the loans, I've been talking for quite a while about the poor loans are sort of losing out in the growth rates to purchase volume and some of the other things that card issuers don't really disclose like originations of accounts, the building of the franchise. And that, of course, was driven by another kind of elephant in the room, which has been the high payment rate. And so I think for a lot of players, the payment rates have really muted the loan growth. That includes Capital One. But I think what's striking, what you see, Betsy, here is that we saw still very high payment rates, and you can look in our trust to see some of the electrifying levels there.  But still, even despite that, some very nice traction in the quarter on loan growth. So what's driving that? In many ways, this stands on the shoulders of a number of years of leaning hard into origination growth and having the balances build over time. Also on credit line increases, we are leaning into those as well, not like a big dramatic thing, but I think in this environment and seeing the results we're seeing, we are leaning more into the credit line opportunity as well. So loan growth is still going to be a hard one to predict and very affected by the payment rate. Parenthetically, we love high payment rates because I think it's a very healthy customer base, an indication of a healthy consumer and we love what it does for the credit side. But I think that we see the opportunity for loan growth, in addition to the other growth metrics, as good.\nJeff Norris: Do you have a follow-up, Betsy?\nBetsy Graseck: Can you hear me?\nJeff Norris: Yes.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, we can.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Sorry about that, just pivoting to Capital. I saw the Board authorization for $5 billion. Can you give us a sense as to the time frame that that's over and if there was a view on what drove that decision to do $5 billion as opposed to any other number?\nAndrew Young: Betty, it's Andrew. I'll take that. So we take into account a number of factors to drive these programs. So as always is the case, our pace for this repurchase authorization as well as the pace and amount of future authorizations are driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted levels of capital and earnings and growth as well as market capacity to repurchase shares. And it also needs to consider the results from each unique CCAR cycle, which effectively happens at the midpoint of each year. So we take all of those factors into account to figure out the amount and the pacing of that. And so we will dynamically manage that given that we are now under SCB, and we have a great deal more flexibility to execute than we have previously.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane: Rich, when we think of the factors that are contributing to the high payment rate, we're all aware of a lot of the economic factors. One thing that we've started to wonder about is, is there some sort of 80-20 rule on transactions? Are large idiosyncratic transactions getting scraped off by some of the alternative products? And is that changing the composition of the book anyway in terms of payment rates?\nRichard Fairbank: Our large transaction is getting scraped off by some of the alternative players out there. It's not a thesis that I have explored. I think that any question people are asking about: are there kind of on little cat feet, effects going on from the fintechs, the huge investment in them and their own investment in our very business, I think they are great things to look for. One thing I would say about payment rates, though, is how broadly across the spectrum of our card business that we have seen payment rates increase over this period of time. It's really not seen to exist or be dominated by a particular segment, let's say, the top of the market or whatever. It's been really pretty broad-based.  We also ourselves have had another growth story going on beneath our growth story, which is the continuing gains and growth in the heavy spender side of the business. And so what we see is -- maybe your effect is going on, but what we see, if anything, is particularly good growth rates over time in the heavy spender side of the business, which I think is more a manifestation of our investments in the kind of products that we've been marketing for a number of years and our investment in the comprehensive experience to really win in that part of the market.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Rich, I wanted to follow up on your payment comments. Are you at all concerned about the normalization of credit outpacing the normalization of payment rates? Or would you expect those metrics to normalize together?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, I think 2 things are kind of driving elevated payment rates right now. And it's really a funny thing. I've been in this business for, as you know, like 3 decades, and payment rates are just not something in general that people always talk about. We would always watch them. Some years ago, even before the pandemic, we started noticing some elevation in payment rates, but we probably more attributed that to the gradual mix change towards spenders in our own portfolio. But if we talk about the 2 main drivers of elevated payment rates, first is payment rates tend to correlate with spend levels. And for obvious reasons, when people are spending more, they're not going to be spending for very long unless they're also paying to keep their open to buy there. So I think that pattern is sort of almost, in a way, sort of just spend and payment math. And given how strong spending has been that, that is an important factor, I think, behind the payment rates.  And then there's the continued impact of healthy consumer balance sheets. And it's unmistakable the effect that, while there are many factors going on, just watching what happened across various segments of our business as things like government stimulus came in and what happened to payment rates, it's pretty clear that consumers, when their balance sheets improved, really used a bunch of those resources to pay down on their credit card and build more open to buy. And we have gone back and really studied the relationship between payment rates and credit for the whole history of our company, and the relationship is unmistakable. Bill, to your point, though, it's not like one-for-one. And I think that we could certainly expect there could be some divergences there.  On the topic of normalization, when we think about the normalization of payment rates, my mind first goes to the normalization of credit. And I think these record levels of low credit losses inevitably have to normalize. And I think when you pull out a magnifying glass and sort of look at various metrics and things in the numbers and behind the numbers, you can see the early signs of normalization that are a little bit ahead of seasonality, for example, that's a very natural thing. Probably what strikes us and kind of surprises us is how modest and moderate those are, but we certainly operate with an assumption of normalization. So I would expect the payment rates to follow, not exactly in lockstep, but I think that, that should follow. And so what happens for investors is a little bit of a trade. At the moment, the financial trade is lower payment rates, lower growth of loans and really spectacular credit. And as things normalize, I think that gives a boost to the loan growth but sort of is offset on the credit side of the house.  So the other thing that's going on at Capital One because if you look at our trust data -- now by the way, our trust, and it's probably true for every player, the securitization trust is not an absolutely representative sample of anybody's full portfolio. But if you look at payment rates at Capital One, probably, even in particular, have just risen so significantly over this period of time. And I haven't looked at it lately, but it wouldn't surprise me if it even rose sort of more than for a number of other competitors. And I think that also reflects another Capital One specific thing that's going on, which is the continued traction of the spending side of the business at Capital One which, of course, manifests itself year-after-year being kind of at the high end of the league tables in terms of purchase volume growth.\nBill Carcache: That's super helpful, Rich. If I could squeeze in a related follow-up. Maybe could you expand on that a little bit and discuss your confidence level in the normalization of payment rates and maybe what some of the puts and takes are to the extent that the normalization occurs a bit faster or slower?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, I, again, think of payment rates, I just go back to the 2 drivers. So one is the strong correlation with spend levels. So one needs really an outlook for what's going to happen to purchase volume in our business and in card businesses. Purchase volume has an incredible strength to it right now, a manifestation of the consumer. Some of it, by the way, is catching up for big pullbacks, of course, during the pandemic. But there's real strength there. If that strength continues, and that's pretty plausible, that would tend to have an upward boost on the payment rate. And then you get to the consumer credit side of the business. And I just believe reverse gravity has got to pull these numbers up. And we all have to understand that, that normalization, the word normal is a really important part of that. It would be extremely normal. It would be expected. We are certainly managing the business to expect that. But as that happens, count me is betting that, that driver of payment rates is going to pull the payment rates down.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: So Rich, in your prepared remarks, you noted that all these investments that you're making in tech and tech talent will pressure the efficiency ratio. But I guess, just given a follow-up on some of the questions from earlier, the revenue backdrop is clearly much better, 10% exit run rate loan growth. And I was wondering, can you maybe just talk about -- you actually used the phrase pressure. I'm wondering, are you actually expecting the efficiency ratio to increase? And if you are, maybe can you just give us some parameters on how long do you expect this to last? How much of an increase can we see over an intermediate time frame? And maybe what are some of the things that you and the team are doing to offset some of these pressures?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So we're not giving really explicit operating efficiency ratio guidance. There's so many factors that go into that, and you know them well. What we wanted to point out is we always want to share with investors the things that we see going on in our company to make sure that they understand this. And the first one, this tech cost, I'm struck a lot of companies, most companies are kind of waiving at labor costs. And I think tech labor costs are an elephant in the room, and every tech company I've talked to is this is an absolute elephant in their room. And I think when you stand back and think about it, that's because every company in the world pretty much these days and we really need to drive tech change and opportunities as fast as we can. How long that supply and demand imbalance is going to last, we'll have to see.  It is the biggest imbalance I've seen in my 3 decades of building and running this company in a labor market. And it may be that this is more of a headwind right now for Capital One in our numbers than for some of the banks or just others. And I want to savor that for a second. One of the big things we've done in our tech transformation is bring in-house engineering talent at scale. And a lot of companies do a lot of outsourcing of that. So we have built a very big engineering team and the related families there. And we've built a brand, and we're a destination for really top tech talent. And that's a wonderful thing, and it really helps us on the recruiting side. But I just wanted to flag that one because how long that imbalance last, I don't know, but it's something that to me is very, very clear.  The other point is on the investment side. And I really want to say it, it's not like we're just going along, doing our tech transformation and looking at the market and say, \"Oh my gosh, we have to just massively invest in ways like we weren't before.\" That's not really what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we are continuing to move up the tech stack in terms of where our investments are. And that's a wonderful thing because the closer you get to the consumer and the top of the tech stack, the more of those opportunities directly can be capitalized in the marketplace. So that's a good thing.  And we've been investing for a long time. My point is that we are still really leaning into this opportunity because the opportunity, the time frames, the imperative is real. And already, what's driving a lot of the growth that you're seeing is the benefits of those things, and it's what will drive a lot of the future growth as a company. So back to your question, while we're not giving explicit efficiency ratio guidance, the use of the word pressure is to explain those 2 phenomena that are going on that I wanted to share with investors that are real, and that pressures the efficiency ratio. Exactly what number come out in the end depends in the end on a lot of things and revenue growth and things. But I just wanted to share that. And I made the same comment in the call the quarter before.\nRyan Nash: As a follow-up to Moshe's question on marketing, I understand the thought that you're leaning in and we're obviously seeing really, really good traction on the growth side. But if I think about the competitive intensity, we've heard Amex saying that marketing is going to come down a little. Discovery's growing. JPMorgan is accelerating. And I think all of us are just looking for some parameters to maybe understand where you are in the stage of investment. And maybe can you just help us understand. Are we at run rate levels in the back half of the year? Do you see another step-up? And just any color that you could provide on how you're thinking about the pace of marketing spend, I think, would be helpful.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Ryan, it is striking the comments that everyone is making about this and probably a little bewildering for investors to understand where equilibrium is these days. You know our philosophy, Ryan. You and I have known each other for a long time. We don't really start the year by saying, this is precisely the marketing -- I mean we always make a budget, but we don't start the year and say, \"Well, this is what everybody has in marketing dollars, no matter what.\" Sometimes we contract what we put in there. Sometimes we expand it. But it's very focused on what's the nature of the opportunity. We also have a strong belief that there are windows of opportunity for growth. And you capitalize on those when you get them or those windows pass. And so that doesn't also lend itself to the kind of let's go and just allocate the same marketing budget every quarter to different parts of our business or anything like that.  So what we do at Capital One is when we see opportunities, we really lean into them. I can't, in advance, tell you quite how far we lean into them because we really look at what's the productivity at the margin for what we are investing. And we look at marketing efficiency on average. We look at it at the margin. We look at it in all of our programs. And of course, also, we look at our brand investments and the other things that we're doing to lift the votes. My message to you here is really 2 points. One, this is a lean-in time and we're going to continue to do that to the extent that the opportunity is there. And you can see the fourth quarter was a pretty high level of lean-in, so that would be an example of that.  My other point is we are, as closely as you, watching the competition and the choices they're making. And higher levels of competition themselves can manifest in different ways. It can affect the ability to generate response. It can affect pricing. The worst thing is when it starts making its way into underwriting practices and starts affecting the credit side of the business. But right now, if I pull way up on the marketplace, we've got a strong consumer where kind of everybody is sort of roaring out of the sort of pandemic, not society necessarily when I'm talking about many of the metrics here. And the marketplace is still generating this opportunity resiliently, and we are leaning into that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani.\nSanjay Sakhrani: So maybe just to ask Ryan's question a little bit differently. I mean shouldn't we expect revenue growth to be above average given these accelerated investments you're making? Maybe you could just give us a sense of what kind of revenue growth you're targeting and what some of the specific products might be that you're rolling out that are sort of unique and separate yourselves from the peers. I'm just thinking about buy now, pay later. Like where are we with the product rollout?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. So we're not giving specific revenue guidance. We are commenting and pleased with the momentum that we have, particularly momentum you saw that picked up in the fourth quarter, and we certainly hope to keep our momentum going there. So I think on the purchase volume side, there's a lot of thrust. We're very pleased with the account originations that we have been able to generate from the enhanced marketing that we're doing and the loan growth, which is a very important part of the revenue growth. That one is always kind of the hardest one to sort of predict because of its linkage to the payment rate. But we do see a good trajectory there. We're not giving specific guidance, but we like what we see there.  In terms of what is driving the growth, I don't think -- you'll occasionally see Capital One on TV with a new product or whatever. We are always coming up with new products, so is competition, by the way. Our surge in growth is not the result of some new product there that's suddenly driving this. This is the result of many things coming together, working particularly well right now. I think a lot of it is really driven by opportunities and capabilities and expansion and experiences for the customer that stand on the shoulders of our tech transformation. So we're hopeful we can continue to drive some strong growth. We're not giving guidance on that. And the biggest, I think, question will be what happens to payment rates and what that does to loan growth.\nSanjay Sakhrani: And maybe just another follow-up on expenses. I'm sorry I'm asking the same questions everyone else is. Rich, you seem to think that the work for sort of inflationary pressure is transitory. Is that the only risk in terms of getting back to sort of that 42% operating efficiency ratio? So if that sort of passes at some point, you guys can get back there? Or is there something else too?\nRichard Fairbank: So we are still driving toward the same destination for operating efficiency improvement. But the timing, that needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace and particularly the one we flagged here more recently, the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent. The investment imperatives of the marketplace and the rising cost of tech talent will pressure our operating efficiency ratio in the near term, as we have discussed. But modern technology capabilities are the engine that drives revenue growth and digital productivity gains, and the investments we're making today are the drivers of the efficiency improvements that we expect to continue to get over time. So we're not in a position to declare the timing of operating efficiency destinations. It's the same journey, the same engine powering it. There are some pressures we shared with you in the nearer term, but it's the same journey. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of delivering long-term shareholder value.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDonald Fandetti: I'll shift gears a little bit, but I do also agree it would be helpful to have some kind of sizing around the expenses just given the environment. You have a really good story to tell outside of that. I guess on auto lending, are you signaling that you might moderate a little bit of growth there? And the Auto Navigator product, which I think is really benefiting from the public cloud, are you getting penetration on that? And can you size that?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Don, the auto business has really been growing strongly. And for starters, that's, very importantly, an industry point. A lot of factors have aligned to create a lot of demand, a lot of demand for used cars, high used cars, car valuations. And it's certainly been, for us and really for the industry, a bit of one of our strongest periods in history. But if we look beneath that because, obviously, all those things normalize over time, we continue to leverage our leading technology, our data and underwriting capabilities to identify market opportunities that we think have attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns. And by the way, a very important part of that is keeping an eye on the very, very high used car prices and as we underwrite, assuming a significant decline in those. So we don't count on something that's not going to be long term sustainable. Whether the industry fully does that, we'll have to see.  Our technology journey, and you mentioned the Auto Navigator product, that's a manifestation of a lot of the technology we've built in the auto business. It really helped us not only deepen our relationship with consumers but also with dealers because Auto Navigator is a winning product for dealers as well as it is for consumers because it's bringing in consumers who've already done a lot of the work to prequalify themselves, and it's the highest quality lead like a dealer can have. So we're not giving out data on the success of Auto Navigator, but we believe that it is a powerful product.  And I've often said to investors, \"Hey, if you want to look at an example and go kind of see the differentiation that Capital One has created in a tech-based, information-based, machine learning-based product, the Auto Navigator and the real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in less than a second is a manifestation of that.\" And that is getting traction. But I do want to say that there are a lot of changes going on in the auto industry, a number of competitors working hard to reinvent how car buying works. And I think for Capital One and a lot of players who are on the frontier of some of those changes, I think there is opportunity for us. And I think some of the success in auto is exactly a manifestation of that.  Let me say one other thing, though, with respect to growth in the auto business. I've always said that the auto business is even more sensitive to competition than the Credit Card business is because of the role that a dealer plays between the consumer and the lender in holding an auction. And so the dealers understandably really tend to drive their business toward the lender who is the most flexible on pricing and terms. And we have seen some of those metrics move in the last quarter. And I think a very robust auto market, it's a natural thing to expect that competition might overheat and pricing and practices could be affected along the way. So I don't want to overstate my point. It's a caution that I put out there, but we are still leaning into our opportunity. But the bit of the volume decline in the fourth quarter, I think, was a competitive effect of the very thing we're talking about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: I guess I'm interested in maybe talking through the mechanics of your net interest margin. Obviously, I want to hear your thoughts on what maybe each rate hike might do to the margin. But beyond that then, there's a lot of other moving factors, like you're going to get some suppression of yield with the evolution of NPAs, you're going to get some late fees to offset that and so on and so forth. So maybe can you give us a sense of what to expect as all those factors come to play in the next few months?\nAndrew Young: Sure, John. It's Andrew. And maybe I'll expand the horizon beyond the next few months because it will take a while for some of the factors that you just described to play out, but why don't I start with the rate side of the equation that you brought up. Our current balance sheet is asset sensitive. So as rates move up, it will clearly be a tailwind to NII. At this point while it's moved a fair amount over the last few months, including, I think, about a 10 basis point retraction over the last week in the 10-year, so it's a volatile number, but the market is currently, last time I checked at least, expecting around 4 hikes in '22. And so that equates to an average Fed fund rates that's about 50 basis points higher for the full year. And you can get a directional indication of the impact of that.  In our Q3 disclosures, I think we showed that relative to forwards, the 50 basis point shock impacts the next 12 months of NII by 1.9%, I believe, is the number. So that's just roughly under $500 million. So that's the dollar effective rates. If you translate the dollar effects into NIM, to the other side of your question, the 3 big factors that are ultimately going to impact NIM are the 3 things that I highlighted in my talking points. And that is just the quantum of card balances. Even though some of the factors you described will potentially impact card margin, it's much more about the card balances to the overall company NIM. The other is cash and securities, which you saw we had an investment portfolio at $100 billion at its peak, it was probably something like $15 billion higher than what is a more normal level and cash levels that were also really high. So you could see cash and securities coming down, which all else equal benefit NIM. And then finally, the rate effect that I just described.  So really, those are the 3 things that we're primarily looking at and will ultimately have the biggest effect on NIM on a run rate basis. In terms of the next few months, the only thing that I know for sure is there's 2 fewer days in the first quarter. So that's roughly a 15 basis point headwind to NIM, all else equal, but the other effects are really what's going to drive the NIM over the longer term.\nJohn Hecht: That's great. I really appreciate that detail. I guess an unrelated follow-up is it seems like you guys have put out a lot of products over the past several quarters that may be targeting some of the fintechs and neobanks. I think you've canceled overdraft protection or moderated that. You've got early payment mechanisms. You've got direct auto type products. I guess the question is, are you able to quantify how that impacts your customer base? Do you get good cross-sell? Does it affect retention rates? Or generally speaking, how do these compete against these new banks that are trying to, I guess, disrupt the overall system?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, John. Well, I love the focus that investors have on fintechs. And let's talk about the reasons for that. First of all, I think the investors are voting with their feet to just the amount of money that is poured into fintechs on the venture capital side, the valuation of fintechs, although the last little bit has been rough for them really speaks to a belief, I think, in the investor community that banking is going to be transformed and the fintechs are going to be important drivers of making that happen. And we're an original fintech. So maybe I have a soft spot in my heart for fintechs and also an understanding of the challenges they face as well. But one thing, we start with one thing that's very clear, Fintech start with modern technology. Everybody starts in the cloud. They don't have all the scale technology you need. They got to build a lot of things, but they start in the cloud.  There's also another phenomenon going on, and that is that one of the most successful parts of fintech has been the platform companies building the shoulders for other fintech to then stand on and build their business. So the ability to enter businesses and move quickly and have modern technology is really striking. The fintechs are also unregulated. So there's a whole vector there in terms of some of the things they're doing and some of the ways that they move and operate that wouldn't be consistent with the banking side of the business.  But I favor all that because I believe also, as do so many investors beating a path into this space, that banking is absolutely in the process of being transformed. And it's kind of striking, the industry has taken as long as it has to be as transformed relative to a lot of other industries. And I think a big reason for it is the regulation that has tended to surround the banking space. Interestingly, by far, the biggest growth vectors have been sort of in the least regulated side of things, in payments and platforms and crypto. And I think the almost unmitigated success of companies in those spaces are really striking.  But let me now go back to Capital One. And I say this as an original fintech and a fintech that really transformed itself into and became one of America's biggest banks. We are building essentially a fintech, and we have built a fintech at scale. We don't have some of the benefits that fintechs have. We have a lot of benefits a lot of fintechs don't have, including a gigantic customer base and national brand, a 3.5 decades of underwriting experience, an unbelievable amount of data that we have collected and have, through our tech transformation, built a very sophisticated, kind of comprehensive way to manage big data and machine learning in real time to create opportunities to be at the forefront of how banking is being transformed. We, as a bank, face our own unique set of challenges fintechs don't have. Fintechs face a lot of challenges they have. But it's not an accident that you noticed Capital One out there with a number of products and even a bit of a brand personality consistent with where fintechs are because we are leaning into some opportunities, the same ones the fintechs are. Some are ones that we're creating in places they're not. But when you hear an optimism in my voice and an excitement, it relates to standing on the shoulders of our tech transformation and the scale and market position we have as a company to create opportunities that I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to do it. It's a tough journey. It requires continued investment, which we talked about, and it's not easy. But I really like our chances. And I think Capital One is ideally positioned to take advantage of the accelerating transformation in banking.\nOperator: And our last question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: On the credit front, I just wanted to see if you can give a little bit of color on the increase in charge-offs and delinquencies on the non-card consumer businesses. I know you mentioned auto. Just wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the drivers there. And then also on the reserve side, another sizable reserve release. As you're looking forward here and as loans begin to strengthen in terms of the balance sheet, do you expect ultimately to begin matching or building reserves here in the coming quarters?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. John, let me talk about credit. Andrew will do the reserve question. So the consumer credit just remains strikingly strong. I mean in all my years, I've never seen anything quite like what we have been through with consumer credit in the last couple of years, and it's still strikingly strong. We, of course, have been saying all through this, normalization is bound to happen. How fast, and it does, and at what trajectory we'll have to see. In the fourth quarter, our card losses, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up 13 basis points, which is consistent with normal seasonal trends. Our card delinquencies increased 29 basis points, and that increase is a bit more than the normal seasonal trend. And I would point at that as an indicator of, more likely than not, early signs of some normalization off of a very, very low base, of course. In the auto business, let's talk about credit performance there. Auto credit performance has been strikingly strong through the pandemic. Fourth quarter losses were just 58 basis points, and that's roughly 1/3 of what they were before the pandemic. In addition to all the positives that have supported consumer credit in general, like you see in our card business, auto is seeing exceptionally strong recoveries supported by record-high vehicle values. And this was enough to push losses negative earlier in 2021. And obviously, that's not sustainable. But by any measure, losses remain exceptionally low. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Q4 was largely normal seasonality. Auto vehicle values remain about 50% above pre-pandemic levels backed by strong consumer demand and ongoing supply constraints. So we certainly would expect auto losses to increase from current levels even if the health of the consumer remains strong, especially because auction prices should normalize over time as supply constraints are resolved. So it's an amazing period that we're in, and we are trying to lean in and capitalize on the opportunities to grow the business with the strength the consumer has and the capacity to grow their own balance sheet. And we are especially watchful of the natural things that can happen to credit at a time like this. I'm talking about the industry. And let me just name 2 there. One is, of course, the natural things like more aggressive marketing and, in the auto business, more aggressive practices with the dealers and things like this.  There's also just one other thing we'll all have to keep an eye on, and that is when we think about -- any of us, and we ask ourselves this question, but I think we're in a stronger position to answer it than maybe many, but when one is doing credit underwriting, how do you build models? What are your models supposed to be looking at when they look in the rearview mirror and see the best credit in the history of these businesses? And so Capital One has a very long kind of history of data on consumers, and we very much point our models to a longer horizon there. But I do worry, especially for the fintechs who are building their own companies from scratch, exactly what's the rearview mirror and what's the information-based underwriting capabilities that can be built here? So we'll just keep an eye out for those effects and expect normalization to occur and take advantage of the opportunities while they're in front of us. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Yes. John, with respect to the allowance, unfortunately, I don't have an easy yes/no answer for you around allowance releases. So let me just start by describing the current allowance because I think that backdrop will be helpful in just painting various pictures of how the coming quarters might unfold. In that way, you have as much knowledge as we do. So when we think about the composition of the allowance, the first thing is just our expectation of future losses and recoveries. And so right now, our outlook assumes relatively swift normalization of losses from today's unusually strong levels. The second factor is just qualitative factors, which we've described before. And today, these qualitative factors remain elevated to account for the remaining uncertainties around the pandemic and the economy, and this is why our coverage ratios remain high. And then the last factor is just the size of the balance sheet at each successive quarter.  And so keep in mind that under CECL allowance, impacts of new growth is pulled forward, so it definitely adds to the quantum of allowance that we need as we grow. But future allowance movements from where we are today will just be determined by how all of these effects net out. And so if normalization plays out and we continue to grow at a significant clip, we could see allowance builds over the next few quarters. The other scenario could be, and clearly, there's many scenarios, but another scenario is favorable credit trends continue the uncertainties that drive the qualitative factors subside, and growth is a little bit more modest than we would likely see further allowance releases. So I just wanted to give you a window into all of the pieces that go into the calculation, and we'll go through a rigorous process every quarter, and we'll see how it ultimately plays out over the year.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, can you just maybe comment a bit on the commercial loan growth trends you're seeing? I know your commercial segment loans were up double digits year-over-year. So I just want a quick bit of color on the drivers there.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, John, our commercial loan growth was 7% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year, and it outpaced industry growth. Normalizing for PPP forgiveness, we're much more in line with the growth of our peers. While we did see a slight increase in our revolver utilization this quarter, our growth was almost entirely driven by originations in our specialty businesses where we generate strong risk-adjusted returns.  And of course, just the other thing I would point out, of course, is our activity in commercial reflects the increased economic activity and a quite attractive market, quite attractive lending conditions in 2021. So it's been, I think, a good time for all commercial lenders. This is in the context of actually a market that still we have a very cautious eye of looking at with the tremendous growth of nonbank lenders and some of the lending practices that are happening outside the banking industry that make their way into our customers. So I think it's a great period at the moment. We continue to be cautious about the opportunity in the context of the bigger marketplace. But thanks very much, John.\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich. And thanks, everybody, for joining us on tonight's conference call. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here to answer any follow-ups you may have later on, and have a good evening, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent night.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Accelerating year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.  As you can see on Slide 11, our Domestic Card business posted strong growth in every top line metric in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 29% year-over-year and up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $10.2 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 10% from the sequential quarter, ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 4%. Ending loan growth was the result of the strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account origination and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates, and revenue was up 15% year-over-year driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans.  Domestic Card revenue margin increased 123 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth, and favorable year-over-year credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in fourth quarter revenue. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.49%, a 120 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.22%, 20 basis points better than the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 13 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 29 basis points.  Noninterest expense was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The biggest driver of noninterest expense was an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $999 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business and our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to grow and build our franchise.  Moving to Slide 12. Strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the fourth quarter. Driven by auto, fourth quarter ending loans increased 13% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 13%. Fourth quarter auto originations were up 32% year-over-year. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our auto business. In the fourth quarter, we saw a pickup in competitive intensity in the marketplace. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 16%.  Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $6.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 7% from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields. Noninterest expense increased 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $58 million year-over-year driven by an allowance release in our auto business. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 0.58%, up 40 basis points. And the 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.32%, up 67 basis points.  Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 12% year-over-year driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 8%. Ending deposits grew 13% from the fourth quarter of 2020 as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits also increased 14% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 19% from the prior year quarter with 29% growth in noninterest income. Noninterest expense was up 17%.  Commercial credit performance remains strong. In the fourth quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was a negative 2 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.1%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our Commercial capability.  I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Growth momentum is evident throughout our fourth quarter results. In the quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. We also posted strong auto and Commercial growth. Credit remains strikingly strong across our business and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. As we enter 2022, we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our businesses and build our franchise. We will continue to lean into marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and drive growth.  For years, we've talked about how sweeping digital change and modern technology are changing the game in banking. Last quarter, I noted that the stakes are rising faster than ever before. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. Also, many legacy companies are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue for them and are increasing technology investments. The war for tech talent continues to escalate, which is driving up tech labor costs even before any headcount increase.  All these developments underscore the significant opportunity for players who have modern technology and who are in a position to drive growth. Capital One is very well positioned to do that. We've spent years driving our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were an original fintech, and we have built modern technology, infrastructure and capabilities at scale. And we're investing to leverage these capabilities to grow and to realize the many benefits of our digital transformation.  We have been on a long journey to drive our operating efficiency ratio down. We expect that the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent, on top of our growth investment, will pressure annual operating efficiency in the near term. But these pressures do not change our belief in the longer-term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains.  Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. And it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.  And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Moshe, there are a number of different factors going on in the fourth quarter, and maybe Andrew can comment specifically about the fourth quarter. But my point about the efficiency is really -- and some of the factors that were -- that I'm talking about in the efficiency ratio certainly manifested themselves in the fourth quarter. But our real point is that we're on a journey to improve operating efficiency. We've been leaning into this, and we're very optimistic about not only what we've done but what we can continue to do. And we're just flagging the tech talent costs and the continued investment in the opportunity. And that opportunity continues to be toward the top of the tech stack, which translates more into growth opportunities probably than some years ago when our investment began at the bottom of the tech stack. These investments are very important. And our point is that collectively, these things will pressure annual efficiency ratio in the near term, but it's really the same journey and the same drivers of opportunity and efficiency.  Andrew, I don't know if you want to make any comments about the fourth quarter specifically. Moshe, it's clear that competition is intense. And you can see from the one you pointed out, direct mail is back at pretty high levels. You can see media advertising increasing throughout 2021. Of course, earnings calls from card players have indicated an expectation of increasing competition. And also in the rewards space, you can see competition is pretty intense there. So we have a very careful eye on that. I would say, though, that even as we have a very careful eye on that, I am struck by how the consumer is in a very good place right now. I think there's some natural growth capacity there. And I'm really struck by the traction that we're getting at Capital One. We continue to see some really good origination opportunities really across our businesses, and we like very much the results that we're seeing.  And the other thing about the competitive intensity at this point is more in upfront investments, such as marketing and upfront bonuses. And at this point, we're not seeing, in the competitive environment, sort of the sacrifices in margin and resilience. I'm talking particularly in the card business there. So we have experience through competitive cycles, and we know what to look for. But we are really pleased by the results, really struck by our opportunity to capitalize on them. And that's why we're leaning in. And that's also why we're flagging, of course, that we have our eyes on the very important issue that you mentioned relative to competition. Betsy, great questions there. So we feel very good about our growth and our growth opportunities that we're seeing right now. Let me start with purchase volume. Obviously, our 29% purchase volume growth was really significant. And we've seen a lot of purchase volume growth across the industry. Of course, that's not just a Capital One effect. But with Capital One, specifically, we are seeing a lot of traction in our various spender programs. We're optimistic about that trajectory.  And the loans, I've been talking for quite a while about the poor loans are sort of losing out in the growth rates to purchase volume and some of the other things that card issuers don't really disclose like originations of accounts, the building of the franchise. And that, of course, was driven by another kind of elephant in the room, which has been the high payment rate. And so I think for a lot of players, the payment rates have really muted the loan growth. That includes Capital One. But I think what's striking, what you see, Betsy, here is that we saw still very high payment rates, and you can look in our trust to see some of the electrifying levels there.  But still, even despite that, some very nice traction in the quarter on loan growth. So what's driving that? In many ways, this stands on the shoulders of a number of years of leaning hard into origination growth and having the balances build over time. Also on credit line increases, we are leaning into those as well, not like a big dramatic thing, but I think in this environment and seeing the results we're seeing, we are leaning more into the credit line opportunity as well. So loan growth is still going to be a hard one to predict and very affected by the payment rate. Parenthetically, we love high payment rates because I think it's a very healthy customer base, an indication of a healthy consumer and we love what it does for the credit side. But I think that we see the opportunity for loan growth, in addition to the other growth metrics, as good. Yes, we can. Our large transaction is getting scraped off by some of the alternative players out there. It's not a thesis that I have explored. I think that any question people are asking about: are there kind of on little cat feet, effects going on from the fintechs, the huge investment in them and their own investment in our very business, I think they are great things to look for. One thing I would say about payment rates, though, is how broadly across the spectrum of our card business that we have seen payment rates increase over this period of time. It's really not seen to exist or be dominated by a particular segment, let's say, the top of the market or whatever. It's been really pretty broad-based.  We also ourselves have had another growth story going on beneath our growth story, which is the continuing gains and growth in the heavy spender side of the business. And so what we see is -- maybe your effect is going on, but what we see, if anything, is particularly good growth rates over time in the heavy spender side of the business, which I think is more a manifestation of our investments in the kind of products that we've been marketing for a number of years and our investment in the comprehensive experience to really win in that part of the market. Well, I think 2 things are kind of driving elevated payment rates right now. And it's really a funny thing. I've been in this business for, as you know, like 3 decades, and payment rates are just not something in general that people always talk about. We would always watch them. Some years ago, even before the pandemic, we started noticing some elevation in payment rates, but we probably more attributed that to the gradual mix change towards spenders in our own portfolio. But if we talk about the 2 main drivers of elevated payment rates, first is payment rates tend to correlate with spend levels. And for obvious reasons, when people are spending more, they're not going to be spending for very long unless they're also paying to keep their open to buy there. So I think that pattern is sort of almost, in a way, sort of just spend and payment math. And given how strong spending has been that, that is an important factor, I think, behind the payment rates.  And then there's the continued impact of healthy consumer balance sheets. And it's unmistakable the effect that, while there are many factors going on, just watching what happened across various segments of our business as things like government stimulus came in and what happened to payment rates, it's pretty clear that consumers, when their balance sheets improved, really used a bunch of those resources to pay down on their credit card and build more open to buy. And we have gone back and really studied the relationship between payment rates and credit for the whole history of our company, and the relationship is unmistakable. Bill, to your point, though, it's not like one-for-one. And I think that we could certainly expect there could be some divergences there.  On the topic of normalization, when we think about the normalization of payment rates, my mind first goes to the normalization of credit. And I think these record levels of low credit losses inevitably have to normalize. And I think when you pull out a magnifying glass and sort of look at various metrics and things in the numbers and behind the numbers, you can see the early signs of normalization that are a little bit ahead of seasonality, for example, that's a very natural thing. Probably what strikes us and kind of surprises us is how modest and moderate those are, but we certainly operate with an assumption of normalization. So I would expect the payment rates to follow, not exactly in lockstep, but I think that, that should follow. And so what happens for investors is a little bit of a trade. At the moment, the financial trade is lower payment rates, lower growth of loans and really spectacular credit. And as things normalize, I think that gives a boost to the loan growth but sort of is offset on the credit side of the house.  So the other thing that's going on at Capital One because if you look at our trust data -- now by the way, our trust, and it's probably true for every player, the securitization trust is not an absolutely representative sample of anybody's full portfolio. But if you look at payment rates at Capital One, probably, even in particular, have just risen so significantly over this period of time. And I haven't looked at it lately, but it wouldn't surprise me if it even rose sort of more than for a number of other competitors. And I think that also reflects another Capital One specific thing that's going on, which is the continued traction of the spending side of the business at Capital One which, of course, manifests itself year-after-year being kind of at the high end of the league tables in terms of purchase volume growth. Well, I, again, think of payment rates, I just go back to the 2 drivers. So one is the strong correlation with spend levels. So one needs really an outlook for what's going to happen to purchase volume in our business and in card businesses. Purchase volume has an incredible strength to it right now, a manifestation of the consumer. Some of it, by the way, is catching up for big pullbacks, of course, during the pandemic. But there's real strength there. If that strength continues, and that's pretty plausible, that would tend to have an upward boost on the payment rate. And then you get to the consumer credit side of the business. And I just believe reverse gravity has got to pull these numbers up. And we all have to understand that, that normalization, the word normal is a really important part of that. It would be extremely normal. It would be expected. We are certainly managing the business to expect that. But as that happens, count me is betting that, that driver of payment rates is going to pull the payment rates down. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So we're not giving really explicit operating efficiency ratio guidance. There's so many factors that go into that, and you know them well. What we wanted to point out is we always want to share with investors the things that we see going on in our company to make sure that they understand this. And the first one, this tech cost, I'm struck a lot of companies, most companies are kind of waiving at labor costs. And I think tech labor costs are an elephant in the room, and every tech company I've talked to is this is an absolute elephant in their room. And I think when you stand back and think about it, that's because every company in the world pretty much these days and we really need to drive tech change and opportunities as fast as we can. How long that supply and demand imbalance is going to last, we'll have to see.  It is the biggest imbalance I've seen in my 3 decades of building and running this company in a labor market. And it may be that this is more of a headwind right now for Capital One in our numbers than for some of the banks or just others. And I want to savor that for a second. One of the big things we've done in our tech transformation is bring in-house engineering talent at scale. And a lot of companies do a lot of outsourcing of that. So we have built a very big engineering team and the related families there. And we've built a brand, and we're a destination for really top tech talent. And that's a wonderful thing, and it really helps us on the recruiting side. But I just wanted to flag that one because how long that imbalance last, I don't know, but it's something that to me is very, very clear.  The other point is on the investment side. And I really want to say it, it's not like we're just going along, doing our tech transformation and looking at the market and say, \"Oh my gosh, we have to just massively invest in ways like we weren't before.\" That's not really what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that we are continuing to move up the tech stack in terms of where our investments are. And that's a wonderful thing because the closer you get to the consumer and the top of the tech stack, the more of those opportunities directly can be capitalized in the marketplace. So that's a good thing.  And we've been investing for a long time. My point is that we are still really leaning into this opportunity because the opportunity, the time frames, the imperative is real. And already, what's driving a lot of the growth that you're seeing is the benefits of those things, and it's what will drive a lot of the future growth as a company. So back to your question, while we're not giving explicit efficiency ratio guidance, the use of the word pressure is to explain those 2 phenomena that are going on that I wanted to share with investors that are real, and that pressures the efficiency ratio. Exactly what number come out in the end depends in the end on a lot of things and revenue growth and things. But I just wanted to share that. And I made the same comment in the call the quarter before. Yes. Ryan, it is striking the comments that everyone is making about this and probably a little bewildering for investors to understand where equilibrium is these days. You know our philosophy, Ryan. You and I have known each other for a long time. We don't really start the year by saying, this is precisely the marketing -- I mean we always make a budget, but we don't start the year and say, \"Well, this is what everybody has in marketing dollars, no matter what.\" Sometimes we contract what we put in there. Sometimes we expand it. But it's very focused on what's the nature of the opportunity. We also have a strong belief that there are windows of opportunity for growth. And you capitalize on those when you get them or those windows pass. And so that doesn't also lend itself to the kind of let's go and just allocate the same marketing budget every quarter to different parts of our business or anything like that.  So what we do at Capital One is when we see opportunities, we really lean into them. I can't, in advance, tell you quite how far we lean into them because we really look at what's the productivity at the margin for what we are investing. And we look at marketing efficiency on average. We look at it at the margin. We look at it in all of our programs. And of course, also, we look at our brand investments and the other things that we're doing to lift the votes. My message to you here is really 2 points. One, this is a lean-in time and we're going to continue to do that to the extent that the opportunity is there. And you can see the fourth quarter was a pretty high level of lean-in, so that would be an example of that.  My other point is we are, as closely as you, watching the competition and the choices they're making. And higher levels of competition themselves can manifest in different ways. It can affect the ability to generate response. It can affect pricing. The worst thing is when it starts making its way into underwriting practices and starts affecting the credit side of the business. But right now, if I pull way up on the marketplace, we've got a strong consumer where kind of everybody is sort of roaring out of the sort of pandemic, not society necessarily when I'm talking about many of the metrics here. And the marketplace is still generating this opportunity resiliently, and we are leaning into that. Okay. So we're not giving specific revenue guidance. We are commenting and pleased with the momentum that we have, particularly momentum you saw that picked up in the fourth quarter, and we certainly hope to keep our momentum going there. So I think on the purchase volume side, there's a lot of thrust. We're very pleased with the account originations that we have been able to generate from the enhanced marketing that we're doing and the loan growth, which is a very important part of the revenue growth. That one is always kind of the hardest one to sort of predict because of its linkage to the payment rate. But we do see a good trajectory there. We're not giving specific guidance, but we like what we see there.  In terms of what is driving the growth, I don't think -- you'll occasionally see Capital One on TV with a new product or whatever. We are always coming up with new products, so is competition, by the way. Our surge in growth is not the result of some new product there that's suddenly driving this. This is the result of many things coming together, working particularly well right now. I think a lot of it is really driven by opportunities and capabilities and expansion and experiences for the customer that stand on the shoulders of our tech transformation. So we're hopeful we can continue to drive some strong growth. We're not giving guidance on that. And the biggest, I think, question will be what happens to payment rates and what that does to loan growth. So we are still driving toward the same destination for operating efficiency improvement. But the timing, that needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace and particularly the one we flagged here more recently, the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent. The investment imperatives of the marketplace and the rising cost of tech talent will pressure our operating efficiency ratio in the near term, as we have discussed. But modern technology capabilities are the engine that drives revenue growth and digital productivity gains, and the investments we're making today are the drivers of the efficiency improvements that we expect to continue to get over time. So we're not in a position to declare the timing of operating efficiency destinations. It's the same journey, the same engine powering it. There are some pressures we shared with you in the nearer term, but it's the same journey. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of delivering long-term shareholder value. Yes, Don, the auto business has really been growing strongly. And for starters, that's, very importantly, an industry point. A lot of factors have aligned to create a lot of demand, a lot of demand for used cars, high used cars, car valuations. And it's certainly been, for us and really for the industry, a bit of one of our strongest periods in history. But if we look beneath that because, obviously, all those things normalize over time, we continue to leverage our leading technology, our data and underwriting capabilities to identify market opportunities that we think have attractive and resilient risk-adjusted returns. And by the way, a very important part of that is keeping an eye on the very, very high used car prices and as we underwrite, assuming a significant decline in those. So we don't count on something that's not going to be long term sustainable. Whether the industry fully does that, we'll have to see.  Our technology journey, and you mentioned the Auto Navigator product, that's a manifestation of a lot of the technology we've built in the auto business. It really helped us not only deepen our relationship with consumers but also with dealers because Auto Navigator is a winning product for dealers as well as it is for consumers because it's bringing in consumers who've already done a lot of the work to prequalify themselves, and it's the highest quality lead like a dealer can have. So we're not giving out data on the success of Auto Navigator, but we believe that it is a powerful product.  And I've often said to investors, \"Hey, if you want to look at an example and go kind of see the differentiation that Capital One has created in a tech-based, information-based, machine learning-based product, the Auto Navigator and the real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in less than a second is a manifestation of that.\" And that is getting traction. But I do want to say that there are a lot of changes going on in the auto industry, a number of competitors working hard to reinvent how car buying works. And I think for Capital One and a lot of players who are on the frontier of some of those changes, I think there is opportunity for us. And I think some of the success in auto is exactly a manifestation of that.  Let me say one other thing, though, with respect to growth in the auto business. I've always said that the auto business is even more sensitive to competition than the Credit Card business is because of the role that a dealer plays between the consumer and the lender in holding an auction. And so the dealers understandably really tend to drive their business toward the lender who is the most flexible on pricing and terms. And we have seen some of those metrics move in the last quarter. And I think a very robust auto market, it's a natural thing to expect that competition might overheat and pricing and practices could be affected along the way. So I don't want to overstate my point. It's a caution that I put out there, but we are still leaning into our opportunity. But the bit of the volume decline in the fourth quarter, I think, was a competitive effect of the very thing we're talking about. Yes, John. Well, I love the focus that investors have on fintechs. And let's talk about the reasons for that. First of all, I think the investors are voting with their feet to just the amount of money that is poured into fintechs on the venture capital side, the valuation of fintechs, although the last little bit has been rough for them really speaks to a belief, I think, in the investor community that banking is going to be transformed and the fintechs are going to be important drivers of making that happen. And we're an original fintech. So maybe I have a soft spot in my heart for fintechs and also an understanding of the challenges they face as well. But one thing, we start with one thing that's very clear, Fintech start with modern technology. Everybody starts in the cloud. They don't have all the scale technology you need. They got to build a lot of things, but they start in the cloud.  There's also another phenomenon going on, and that is that one of the most successful parts of fintech has been the platform companies building the shoulders for other fintech to then stand on and build their business. So the ability to enter businesses and move quickly and have modern technology is really striking. The fintechs are also unregulated. So there's a whole vector there in terms of some of the things they're doing and some of the ways that they move and operate that wouldn't be consistent with the banking side of the business.  But I favor all that because I believe also, as do so many investors beating a path into this space, that banking is absolutely in the process of being transformed. And it's kind of striking, the industry has taken as long as it has to be as transformed relative to a lot of other industries. And I think a big reason for it is the regulation that has tended to surround the banking space. Interestingly, by far, the biggest growth vectors have been sort of in the least regulated side of things, in payments and platforms and crypto. And I think the almost unmitigated success of companies in those spaces are really striking.  But let me now go back to Capital One. And I say this as an original fintech and a fintech that really transformed itself into and became one of America's biggest banks. We are building essentially a fintech, and we have built a fintech at scale. We don't have some of the benefits that fintechs have. We have a lot of benefits a lot of fintechs don't have, including a gigantic customer base and national brand, a 3.5 decades of underwriting experience, an unbelievable amount of data that we have collected and have, through our tech transformation, built a very sophisticated, kind of comprehensive way to manage big data and machine learning in real time to create opportunities to be at the forefront of how banking is being transformed. We, as a bank, face our own unique set of challenges fintechs don't have. Fintechs face a lot of challenges they have. But it's not an accident that you noticed Capital One out there with a number of products and even a bit of a brand personality consistent with where fintechs are because we are leaning into some opportunities, the same ones the fintechs are. Some are ones that we're creating in places they're not. But when you hear an optimism in my voice and an excitement, it relates to standing on the shoulders of our tech transformation and the scale and market position we have as a company to create opportunities that I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to do it. It's a tough journey. It requires continued investment, which we talked about, and it's not easy. But I really like our chances. And I think Capital One is ideally positioned to take advantage of the accelerating transformation in banking. Okay. John, let me talk about credit. Andrew will do the reserve question. So the consumer credit just remains strikingly strong. I mean in all my years, I've never seen anything quite like what we have been through with consumer credit in the last couple of years, and it's still strikingly strong. We, of course, have been saying all through this, normalization is bound to happen. How fast, and it does, and at what trajectory we'll have to see. In the fourth quarter, our card losses, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up 13 basis points, which is consistent with normal seasonal trends. Our card delinquencies increased 29 basis points, and that increase is a bit more than the normal seasonal trend. And I would point at that as an indicator of, more likely than not, early signs of some normalization off of a very, very low base, of course. In the auto business, let's talk about credit performance there. Auto credit performance has been strikingly strong through the pandemic. Fourth quarter losses were just 58 basis points, and that's roughly 1/3 of what they were before the pandemic. In addition to all the positives that have supported consumer credit in general, like you see in our card business, auto is seeing exceptionally strong recoveries supported by record-high vehicle values. And this was enough to push losses negative earlier in 2021. And obviously, that's not sustainable. But by any measure, losses remain exceptionally low. The quarter-over-quarter increase in Q4 was largely normal seasonality. Auto vehicle values remain about 50% above pre-pandemic levels backed by strong consumer demand and ongoing supply constraints. So we certainly would expect auto losses to increase from current levels even if the health of the consumer remains strong, especially because auction prices should normalize over time as supply constraints are resolved. So it's an amazing period that we're in, and we are trying to lean in and capitalize on the opportunities to grow the business with the strength the consumer has and the capacity to grow their own balance sheet. And we are especially watchful of the natural things that can happen to credit at a time like this. I'm talking about the industry. And let me just name 2 there. One is, of course, the natural things like more aggressive marketing and, in the auto business, more aggressive practices with the dealers and things like this.  There's also just one other thing we'll all have to keep an eye on, and that is when we think about -- any of us, and we ask ourselves this question, but I think we're in a stronger position to answer it than maybe many, but when one is doing credit underwriting, how do you build models? What are your models supposed to be looking at when they look in the rearview mirror and see the best credit in the history of these businesses? And so Capital One has a very long kind of history of data on consumers, and we very much point our models to a longer horizon there. But I do worry, especially for the fintechs who are building their own companies from scratch, exactly what's the rearview mirror and what's the information-based underwriting capabilities that can be built here? So we'll just keep an eye out for those effects and expect normalization to occur and take advantage of the opportunities while they're in front of us. Andrew? Yes, John, our commercial loan growth was 7% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year, and it outpaced industry growth. Normalizing for PPP forgiveness, we're much more in line with the growth of our peers. While we did see a slight increase in our revolver utilization this quarter, our growth was almost entirely driven by originations in our specialty businesses where we generate strong risk-adjusted returns.  And of course, just the other thing I would point out, of course, is our activity in commercial reflects the increased economic activity and a quite attractive market, quite attractive lending conditions in 2021. So it's been, I think, a good time for all commercial lenders. This is in the context of actually a market that still we have a very cautious eye of looking at with the tremendous growth of nonbank lenders and some of the lending practices that are happening outside the banking industry that make their way into our customers. So I think it's a great period at the moment. We continue to be cautious about the opportunity in the context of the bigger marketplace. But thanks very much, John."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.41 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $12.4 billion or $26.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year earnings per share were $27.11. Full year ROTCE was 28.4%.  Included in the results for the fourth quarter was an upgrade to a legacy rewards program, which increased our rewards liability and decreased noninterest income by $92 million. Both period end and average loans held for investment grew 6% on a linked-quarter basis. Ending loans grew 10% in Domestic Card, 7% in Commercial and 1% in Consumer Banking. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4% driven by the loan growth I just described, while total noninterest expense increased 12% in the quarter driven by increases in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $381 million as net charge-offs of $527 million were partially offset by a modest allowance relief .  Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company, we released $145 million of allowance in the fourth quarter, bringing the total allowance balance to $11.4 billion. The total company coverage ratio now stands at 4.12%.  Turning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance of each of our segments in greater detail. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio declined in each of our segments. In Domestic Card, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. The decline in card coverage was driven by the impact of balance growth that I highlighted earlier. In our Consumer Banking segment, continued strength in auto auction values drove a decline in both the allowance balance and the coverage ratio. And in Commercial, the decline in allowance balance was driven by modest credit improvement in the existing portfolio. In addition to the allowance decline, the coverage ratio was also aided by growth in lower loss segments.  Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 139%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. We continue to gradually run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic. Relative to the prior quarter, ending cash and equivalents were down about $5 billion and investment securities were down about $3 billion as we used our liquidity to fund loan growth and share buybacks.  Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. You can see that our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 25 basis points higher than Q3 and 55 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by balance sheet mix as we had a reduction in cash and securities as well as a higher amount of card loans. Outside of quarterly day count effects, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the change in card balances, cash and securities levels and interest rates.  Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock, which completed our $7.5 billion Board authorization. Our Board of Directors has approved an additional repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of the company's common stock.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure. Yes. Moshe, you're well aware that we seasonally typically have higher expenses in the quarter, largely driven by the marginal cost of growth. Beyond that normal seasonal pattern, there were a few things that are reflected in this fourth quarter, the first of which is we saw some revenue driven and other incentive compensation. We also chose to make some of the investments, that Rich just described, in the professional services side to help accelerate some of the technology and other project work that Rich is referencing that will drive future growth. And so those couple of factors, some of which will continue as we head into next year. And we're seeing a little bit of the leading edge of the wage pressures so I would expect that to accelerate a bit, but some of the marked-related items in incentive compensation, some of the project work, will likely fall off. Betty, it's Andrew. I'll take that. So we take into account a number of factors to drive these programs. So as always is the case, our pace for this repurchase authorization as well as the pace and amount of future authorizations are driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted levels of capital and earnings and growth as well as market capacity to repurchase shares. And it also needs to consider the results from each unique CCAR cycle, which effectively happens at the midpoint of each year. So we take all of those factors into account to figure out the amount and the pacing of that. And so we will dynamically manage that given that we are now under SCB, and we have a great deal more flexibility to execute than we have previously. Sure, John. It's Andrew. And maybe I'll expand the horizon beyond the next few months because it will take a while for some of the factors that you just described to play out, but why don't I start with the rate side of the equation that you brought up. Our current balance sheet is asset sensitive. So as rates move up, it will clearly be a tailwind to NII. At this point while it's moved a fair amount over the last few months, including, I think, about a 10 basis point retraction over the last week in the 10-year, so it's a volatile number, but the market is currently, last time I checked at least, expecting around 4 hikes in '22. And so that equates to an average Fed fund rates that's about 50 basis points higher for the full year. And you can get a directional indication of the impact of that.  In our Q3 disclosures, I think we showed that relative to forwards, the 50 basis point shock impacts the next 12 months of NII by 1.9%, I believe, is the number. So that's just roughly under $500 million. So that's the dollar effective rates. If you translate the dollar effects into NIM, to the other side of your question, the 3 big factors that are ultimately going to impact NIM are the 3 things that I highlighted in my talking points. And that is just the quantum of card balances. Even though some of the factors you described will potentially impact card margin, it's much more about the card balances to the overall company NIM. The other is cash and securities, which you saw we had an investment portfolio at $100 billion at its peak, it was probably something like $15 billion higher than what is a more normal level and cash levels that were also really high. So you could see cash and securities coming down, which all else equal benefit NIM. And then finally, the rate effect that I just described.  So really, those are the 3 things that we're primarily looking at and will ultimately have the biggest effect on NIM on a run rate basis. In terms of the next few months, the only thing that I know for sure is there's 2 fewer days in the first quarter. So that's roughly a 15 basis point headwind to NIM, all else equal, but the other effects are really what's going to drive the NIM over the longer term. Yes. John, with respect to the allowance, unfortunately, I don't have an easy yes/no answer for you around allowance releases. So let me just start by describing the current allowance because I think that backdrop will be helpful in just painting various pictures of how the coming quarters might unfold. In that way, you have as much knowledge as we do. So when we think about the composition of the allowance, the first thing is just our expectation of future losses and recoveries. And so right now, our outlook assumes relatively swift normalization of losses from today's unusually strong levels. The second factor is just qualitative factors, which we've described before. And today, these qualitative factors remain elevated to account for the remaining uncertainties around the pandemic and the economy, and this is why our coverage ratios remain high. And then the last factor is just the size of the balance sheet at each successive quarter.  And so keep in mind that under CECL allowance, impacts of new growth is pulled forward, so it definitely adds to the quantum of allowance that we need as we grow. But future allowance movements from where we are today will just be determined by how all of these effects net out. And so if normalization plays out and we continue to grow at a significant clip, we could see allowance builds over the next few quarters. The other scenario could be, and clearly, there's many scenarios, but another scenario is favorable credit trends continue the uncertainties that drive the qualitative factors subside, and growth is a little bit more modest than we would likely see further allowance releases. So I just wanted to give you a window into all of the pieces that go into the calculation, and we'll go through a rigorous process every quarter, and we'll see how it ultimately plays out over the year."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. \nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Keith, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2021 results.\n With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors and click on Quarterly Earnings Release.\n Please note that this presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Information regarding Capital One's financial performance and any forward-looking statements contained in today's discussion and the materials speak only as of the particular date or dates indicated in the materials. \n Capital One does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Numerous factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section in our annual and quarterly reports accessible at Capital One's website and filed with the SEC. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew? \nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86.\n On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to be held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%.\n Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release.\n Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described.\n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%.  The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic.\n The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7.\n You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors.\n First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.\n We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And however, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. \n Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million.\n Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? \nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly.\n Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year.\n Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%.\n Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. \n The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. \n Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. \n Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.\n We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. \n At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. \n Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. \n Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. \n Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. \n Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.\n Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. \n Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. \n Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.\n In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. \n Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. \n All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. \n But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. \n Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. \n Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.\n And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? \nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. \n [Operator Instructions] \n If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: So Rich, you talked about competition across the industry has intensified, you noted in both traditional players and fintechs. And yet, it seems like your strategy is working as evidenced by the better-than-peer growth metrics and credit. \n So I was just wondering, can you maybe just talk about the competitive environment you're seeing out there? \n How does it compare to maybe the middle part of the last decade? Where we saw competition accelerate? And where do you think it goes from here? And then I guess, maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company? And I have 1 follow-up question. \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Ryan, great question. So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. \n The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns.\n Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending, and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry.\n So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation.\n And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. \n Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. \n Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. \n So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of -- the credit quality of what is being booked. \n So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heed up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. \n And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top. \nRyan Nash: And if I can just ask one quick follow-up. I know credit is as good as it's ever been. And I know you don't have a crystal ball, but yours is probably better than mine. \n So I was wondering that given that this downturn has been like no other, how are you thinking about the trajectory of credit over an intermediate time frame? Do you think we could run well below normal for an extended period of time? Or do you think there is the risk of fast normalization as the industry has become more concerned about? \nRichard Fairbank: Well, I think we are, Ryan, certainly in a pretty extraordinary -- well, not even pretty extraordinary. We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. \n Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. \n We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. \n So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies.\n So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on.\n But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Rich, you talked a lot about the competitive dynamic in the credit card industry and talked about some steps you're taking from an underwriting standpoint to kind of make up for that. \n Could you talk a little bit about how you think about the ability to expand credit lines for your customers? Because that's always been a big factor in terms of generating kind of ongoing loan growth and strong spreads. I do have a follow-up question. \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So Moshe, we are -- as you know, we talked about continuing our originations going in prior years, sometimes while we were holding back on line with the caution about the environment that we were in. And we talked about the coiled spring that, that represents.\n And so we always take the philosophy of trying to continue to build the underlying franchise and then expand the lines as we see validation about the strength of the marketplace and the strength of the individual customers. \n And we are gradually increasing credit lines, nothing too dramatic, but consistent with how we're leaning in, in general. We are increasing credit lines gradually. So that will be another boost on the loan growth side. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Got you. And just as a follow-up, you talked about the potential for pressure on the efficiency ratio. I mean, you've had some pretty strong revenue growth. Could you talk about -- I mean, obviously, one would think that, that kind of helps from the standpoint of being able to fund the investment. Could you talk about what factors would drive periods of time where that efficiency ratio would be pressured versus times would be improving? \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. \n But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. \n And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. \n And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. \n And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. \n And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total.\n And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking.\n So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity.\n So Moshe, the pulling way up -- the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from one thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. \n And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures' efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. \n But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck: Rich, I wanted to understand in the spend numbers that you generated in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense as to what you're seeing in terms of where there's been change at the margin? Has this spend been accelerating in any specific type of customer, maybe the higher end or the starter routers. \n And then the degree to which you think that's sustainable here going forward, what are you sensing in terms of spend trajectory from here? And then I have a follow-up. Could you hear me, okay? \nAndrew Young: Betsy, this is Andrew. I can hear you, but we had Rich on mute for a second. \nRichard Fairbank: I was on mute, sorry. Let me start over, Betsy. Great, It was so eloquent. I can't repeat what I said now. But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago -- I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago.\n But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our -- the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. \n Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. \n I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. \n And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates. But we were really happy to see that even the outstanding growth is -- the needle started to move there in the quarter. \nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Just the other follow-up question I had has to do with how you think about not only the cost per account, but the value of that account and how long it takes for that account to become at run rate? \n I asked because you mentioned earlier how the competition is quite hot. So you might -- someone might come away from this call thinking, okay, cost to acquire account is up, but then the value of that account getting to full run rate levels, how do you feel about that in this environment versus what you've seen in the past?\n Is that something that takes a 12- to 18-month time frame or given where we are with the job growth inflation pick up all that, is it possible that there's a longer tail on the value of the accounts that you're generating today? \nRichard Fairbank: So the time to pay back for any of the originations we do, obviously, is dependent on the particular segment. But we've been investing for years and not just spending money on marketing, but spending money on building the franchise of Capital One. And the building a brand, creating the really exceptional technology that powers the products that we have with customers, creating exceptional customer experiences. \n And I think what we are seeing is the continued benefit of our investment in the franchise. Now we talked about leaning into marketing, which we have been doing and -- as I said, we're continuing to do that. We see good opportunities in the places we've been investing for years. \n And while there is increasing competition, we continue to see a good origination traction and a cost per account originated that is very reasonable for us by our historical standards. \n And we really like everything we see about the early performance of the things that we're booking. So that would suggest, let's see that the value of these accounts should be strong. And so given all of this, we see opportunity to continue as we've been going and keep a close eye on things that may change in the marketplace one segment at a time. But for right now, we think the opportunities are good and the return on the growing investment that we have had is good. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. \nRichard Shane: Rich, look, you've been very clear about the opportunity, generally speaking, in terms of technology. When we think about technology, I think there are probably 4 places or 4 opportunities. It's product, it's customer experience, it's back office, and it's potentially underwriting and adding value there.\n I'm curious, when you think about those 4 factors or those 4 elements, where you see the biggest opportunity to enhance return? And are you seeing misuse of technology and people driving bad decisions or bad outcomes on any of these factors? \nRichard Fairbank: So hello, Rick. And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. \n And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. And importantly, what I want to say is and what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates.\n Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. \n And just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity -- having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. \n I'll give you 2 examples. One is in credit cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, they don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud.\n But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. \n So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks, the business. Risk management is the business. And the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled.  \n There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and Credit Wise.\n In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. \n We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app.  \n I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. \n We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. \n Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. \n Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which in turn accelerates our progress. \n So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list, our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. And so we like very much the position that we're in here. as I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick. \nOperator: We'll take our next Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. \nBill Carcache: Rich, I wanted to ask specifically about your high-spending transactor business. Are you seeing evidence of the larger banks demonstrate demonstrating a willingness to go underwater on credit card rewards with the hope of driving engagement and winning business in other areas like wealth management and mortgage. And if so, how do you see these dynamics playing out across the industry in general and Capital One in particular? \nRichard Fairbank: So the competition in rewards is certainly very intense. We see it in the marketing levels, everybody's stepping up for more of that. The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cash back space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because of what's happening and it's great for consumers.\n The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what I -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. \n Now there may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, we have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise.  \n And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly investing -- years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. \nJohn Pancari: Just on the expense side, I know you indicated on the marketing side, you expect a sequential quarter increase in the fourth quarter, consistent with the historical trends. If you look at it, going back, you're seeing anywhere between $100 million to $300 million linked quarter increase in the fourth quarter in marketing costs. So just wanted to try to get an idea if you can maybe help us size that up. \n And then one separate thing on the expense side. The efficiency ratio longer-term implication of the IT investment. Just wondering if there's any way to think about what that could interpret into in terms of an impact on the ratio on that operating ratio. \nAndrew Young: John, I'll take the first question and then pass it over to Rich for the second one. As you note, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonal increase just due to volumes and a number of -- I think you used the term sundry items. And Rich has talked about the investment that we are making on the technology side and compensation. So I would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance, but I think if you look at history as your guide, there's a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the near term.\n And Rich talked about the investments over time and how that's going to play into the number of factors across the P&L in terms of revenue growth in fraud and many other things that are playing down through there. So that's how I would think about the short to medium term. And I'll turn it over to Rich to answer your second question. \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So John, we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving, which along the way was going to cost more to drive that, that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could -- that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that, that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for Capital One.\n And we've already -- seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while, again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. \n The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that.  \n So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest. And the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way. \nJohn Pancari: And then on the credit front, on delinquency trends, just wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about if you're seeing any changes in the lower FICO bands in terms of delinquency trends. \n We've been seeing that at a couple of other players that they're seeing some pressure on the lower FICO and non-prime areas? Are you seeing anything there, any evidence of upside pressure that would not be otherwise seasonally evident? \nRichard Fairbank: Yes, John, I think that most of what we see tends to be more in the range of normal. But I would be the first to argue that subprime customers have certainly had a number of benefits in the marketplace that, that over time will and are going away. \n So it would be a natural thing. Normalization is a very natural thing across the board. It would certainly be a natural thing there. We watch all these trends carefully. What we've seen in both card and auto would really be in the category of both seasonal and normal. But I wouldn't draw any big extrapolations from that, just more of an observation of what we see at this point. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I have 1 big picture question for Rich. Obviously, a big topic in the fintech world is embedded banking and how big tech companies might be the central hub for consumers rather than what currently might be the bank app? I know you're making sizable investments to compete, but do you think there's inevitability that behavior shift towards these aggregators? \nRichard Fairbank: So Sanjay, look, that is a really great question. And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. \n So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. \n And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. \n And that has been central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. \n But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank.\n And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time. And one of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on, that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. \n And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have -- both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that. But also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. \n And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. \n They're not proactive banking in the sense of spamming more customers with lots of cross-sell offers. But really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't, and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need.\n And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago, were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. \n So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Just one quick follow-up for Andrew. On the NIM, obviously, you saw a nice increase and you mentioned a number of different items. But as we look ahead, it would seem with the loan growth and the remixing, there's probably tailwinds for the NIM to the upside? Or how should we think about that, U.S. cards specifically? \nAndrew Young: So Sanjay, you're touching on really the primary drivers. So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit, kind of, benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees.\n They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends.\n I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. \n So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. \nJohn Hecht: Sanjay actually just asked my NIM question. So I have a question, maybe diving deeper into the growth opportunities. Are you seeing -- is there a better arbitrage or better competitive opportunities in revolver versus transactor? Or is it subprime versus prime? And maybe answer that both card and auto. \nRichard Fairbank: Okay, John, I don't see a particular segment that really stands out. A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. \n And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One.\n We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto -- there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing.\n Given the strength, we have been particularly -- had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction.\n And so we continue to be -- very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. \n And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And as the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. \n So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. \n There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have -- our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively.\n So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment, at some point those planets won't be as aligned as they have been. \nOperator: Our last question this evening is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. \nKevin Barker: Just to follow-up on some of the competitive dynamics that you speak about, especially for fintechs. I mean have you considered possibly more radical change? Whether it's acquiring the fintechs in order to accelerate your growth or your competitive position in the market or potentially trying to develop more radical efficiencies within Capital One, in order to spend to address the competitive environment within fintech? \nRichard Fairbank: Sorry, I was on mute there. Sorry for the silence. Thank you, Kevin, for the good question there. As we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot.\n And by the way, however important scale was years ago -- and by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago -- and I've always were worshiped on the altar, scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And One is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. \n At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean -- by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are, and we like our chances. \n Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. \n We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them to take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. \n I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have. And pretty much every fintech out there -- every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. \n Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made. \nJeff Norris: Well, I think that concludes our earnings call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great night. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly.\n Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year.\n Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%.\n Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. \n The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. \n Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. \n Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.\n We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. \n At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. \n Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. \n Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. \n Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. \n Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.\n Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. \n Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. \n Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.\n In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. \n Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. \n All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. \n But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. \n Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. \n Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.\n And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Okay. Ryan, great question. So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. \n The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns.\n Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending, and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry.\n So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation.\n And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. \n Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. \n Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. \n So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of -- the credit quality of what is being booked. \n So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heed up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. \n And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top. Well, I think we are, Ryan, certainly in a pretty extraordinary -- well, not even pretty extraordinary. We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. \n Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. \n We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. \n So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies.\n So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on.\n But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities. Yes. So Moshe, we are -- as you know, we talked about continuing our originations going in prior years, sometimes while we were holding back on line with the caution about the environment that we were in. And we talked about the coiled spring that, that represents.\n And so we always take the philosophy of trying to continue to build the underlying franchise and then expand the lines as we see validation about the strength of the marketplace and the strength of the individual customers. \n And we are gradually increasing credit lines, nothing too dramatic, but consistent with how we're leaning in, in general. We are increasing credit lines gradually. So that will be another boost on the loan growth side. Yes. Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. \n But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. \n And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. \n And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. \n And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. \n And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total.\n And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking.\n So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity.\n So Moshe, the pulling way up -- the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from one thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. \n And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures' efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. \n But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency. I was on mute, sorry. Let me start over, Betsy. Great, It was so eloquent. I can't repeat what I said now. But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago -- I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago.\n But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our -- the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. \n Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. \n I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. \n And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates. But we were really happy to see that even the outstanding growth is -- the needle started to move there in the quarter. So the time to pay back for any of the originations we do, obviously, is dependent on the particular segment. But we've been investing for years and not just spending money on marketing, but spending money on building the franchise of Capital One. And the building a brand, creating the really exceptional technology that powers the products that we have with customers, creating exceptional customer experiences. \n And I think what we are seeing is the continued benefit of our investment in the franchise. Now we talked about leaning into marketing, which we have been doing and -- as I said, we're continuing to do that. We see good opportunities in the places we've been investing for years. \n And while there is increasing competition, we continue to see a good origination traction and a cost per account originated that is very reasonable for us by our historical standards. \n And we really like everything we see about the early performance of the things that we're booking. So that would suggest, let's see that the value of these accounts should be strong. And so given all of this, we see opportunity to continue as we've been going and keep a close eye on things that may change in the marketplace one segment at a time. But for right now, we think the opportunities are good and the return on the growing investment that we have had is good. So hello, Rick. And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. \n And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. And importantly, what I want to say is and what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates.\n Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. \n And just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity -- having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. \n I'll give you 2 examples. One is in credit cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, they don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud.\n But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. \n So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks, the business. Risk management is the business. And the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled.  \n There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and Credit Wise.\n In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. \n We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app.  \n I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. \n We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. \n Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. \n Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which in turn accelerates our progress. \n So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list, our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. And so we like very much the position that we're in here. as I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick. So the competition in rewards is certainly very intense. We see it in the marketing levels, everybody's stepping up for more of that. The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cash back space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because of what's happening and it's great for consumers.\n The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what I -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. \n Now there may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, we have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise.  \n And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly investing -- years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have. Yes. So John, we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving, which along the way was going to cost more to drive that, that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could -- that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that, that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for Capital One.\n And we've already -- seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while, again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. \n The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that.  \n So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest. And the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way. Yes, John, I think that most of what we see tends to be more in the range of normal. But I would be the first to argue that subprime customers have certainly had a number of benefits in the marketplace that, that over time will and are going away. \n So it would be a natural thing. Normalization is a very natural thing across the board. It would certainly be a natural thing there. We watch all these trends carefully. What we've seen in both card and auto would really be in the category of both seasonal and normal. But I wouldn't draw any big extrapolations from that, just more of an observation of what we see at this point. So Sanjay, look, that is a really great question. And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. \n So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. \n And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. \n And that has been central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. \n But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank.\n And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time. And one of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on, that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. \n And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have -- both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that. But also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. \n And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. \n They're not proactive banking in the sense of spamming more customers with lots of cross-sell offers. But really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't, and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need.\n And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago, were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. \n So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is. Okay, John, I don't see a particular segment that really stands out. A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. \n And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One.\n We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto -- there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing.\n Given the strength, we have been particularly -- had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction.\n And so we continue to be -- very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. \n And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And as the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. \n So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. \n There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have -- our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively.\n So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment, at some point those planets won't be as aligned as they have been. Sorry, I was on mute there. Sorry for the silence. Thank you, Kevin, for the good question there. As we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot.\n And by the way, however important scale was years ago -- and by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago -- and I've always were worshiped on the altar, scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And One is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. \n At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean -- by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are, and we like our chances. \n Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. \n We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them to take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. \n I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have. And pretty much every fintech out there -- every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. \n Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86.\n On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to be held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%.\n Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release.\n Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described.\n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%.  The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic.\n The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7.\n You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors.\n First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.\n We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And however, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. \n Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million.\n Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Betsy, this is Andrew. I can hear you, but we had Rich on mute for a second. John, I'll take the first question and then pass it over to Rich for the second one. As you note, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonal increase just due to volumes and a number of -- I think you used the term sundry items. And Rich has talked about the investment that we are making on the technology side and compensation. So I would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance, but I think if you look at history as your guide, there's a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the near term.\n And Rich talked about the investments over time and how that's going to play into the number of factors across the P&L in terms of revenue growth in fraud and many other things that are playing down through there. So that's how I would think about the short to medium term. And I'll turn it over to Rich to answer your second question. So Sanjay, you're touching on really the primary drivers. So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit, kind of, benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees.\n They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends.\n I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. \n So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Holly. And welcome everyone to Capital One's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2021 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation. To access a copy of the presentation and press release, please go to Capital One's website, click on Investors, then click on Quarterly Earnings Release.\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71. On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs with offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release. Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of a strong domestic card purchase volume on non-interest income, and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investments grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held for sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held for sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an international card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance, primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. Turning to Slide 5, we provide to be allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew. And good evening everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balance and provision for credit losses improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Side 11. Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our domestic card business. As we emerge from the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments. Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results. Domestic card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw a growth of 17% versus 2019. T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June, T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019. At the end of the quarter, domestic card loan balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held for sale last year, second quarter ending loans declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5% ahead of typical seasonal growth of 2%.\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question, plus a single follow-up. If you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call. Holly, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you so much.  Our first question today will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good evening. Want to see if I can get your thoughts on the payment rates. Did you see a peak in the quarter? And if not, if you can talk about the timing of inflection? And then separately, how does that impact your growth assumption for card receivables and the timing on that front? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: You know, John, in our card business, payment rates remain at historically high levels. And as you know, government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer balance sheets are extremely healthy and payment rates remain elevated. You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics. And while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels and these high payment rates are muting balance growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So, we actually are always happy when our customers are paying in high levels and it's indicative of a healthy consumer. And those high-payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see. We are -- if we look at the monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that would be a trend to indicate. It's certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more and they're going out, returning hopefully back to normal, it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move toward normalizing a little bit. So I guess, John, I would say, we've seen the earliest of indications of that. It's still running at really quite a breathtaking level.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Rich, putting together the comments you made about the significant amount of excess capital and then the comment in the release about seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build your franchise, could you talk a little bit about whether you're looking at primarily kind of organic opportunities or inorganic ones as well?\nRichard Fairbank: Moshe, as you know well because you've been there from the beginning in following us and having great insights. We really built our company as sort of wired for organic growth. We installed that in the founding days, what I call horizontal accounting where we track every action and cohort, and everything on a lifetime economic basis and we measure it before and during and afterward to see how it's going. And that -- and so, we always put organic at the top of the list. And here is a great example. I mean, while every bank that's -- every National Bank that's been created has come through many, many acquisitions. We've had some acquisitions in our journey but we are really leaning into an organically driven national growth strategy in banking. So -- and as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built in some of the innovations that we're rolling out. On -- with respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there is a spectrum on the technology side with respect to FinTechs and tech companies on the continuum at one end is, just being a partner with them and then next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake for example and then there are some times acquisitions. All of those have -- we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years, and I'm struck by the traction and success that we're having. When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little FinTechs for example and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance and in many ways, these things are generally outperforming. One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack so do the FinTechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so, the integration and the compatibility, the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past the -- sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in our favor. So, lots of positives there. There is one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side and that's the valuations. So, we've recently gone to several -- a few of these conversations and said, love the company but not at that price. So, we are very aware about the -- where pricing is but strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One it's an organic-first strategy but acquisitions of FinTechs and tech companies at the right price, usually be little ones, I think will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Next, we'll hear from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Thank you. Considering the -- we saw in the first -- during 2020, do you expect normalized credit to maybe run below pre-pandemic levels as we go into 2022 and eventually into 2023?\nRichard Fairbank: Kevin,  hearing that. But I think we -- it was a little echoey but I think we -- I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. From where we are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times. It's got a ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is because we want to be coy about it, but because in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days. What we like to talk about is the drivers. So, talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is, and I mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease , I think there is a bit of accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers. The -- so we -- there's really only one way for the credit to go from here and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a head start and I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on payment rates. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize. The directions are inevitable, the timing is speculative. Our view is during this period of time let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is but let's also be cognizant of how markets work -- how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, we're -- and this topic has come up a couple of times. We're looking at the reserve rates and thinking about them in the context of day one reserve levels. I'm curious how you now reflect on day one allowance coverage and what that could look like on a long-term basis as we return to normal? I'm curious in particular, if you think some of the policy initiatives we've seen during the crisis change your long-term outlook in terms of potential loss rates?,\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Rick. This is Andrew. I'll take that. I think as we look at the allowance, every quarter we're going to take into account a large number of variables and assumptions which would certainly take policy and other factors. And so, as I reflect back on the ratio that we had upon adoption, a lot of things have changed since then. And so, within every single asset class, the mix is going to impact our coverage needs and then you look at overall the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things. So, I look at all of those factors and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also think that if you put into the formula, like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like. But again, it will take into account each successive quarter all of the things that we're looking at in terms of the mix and broad economic assumptions, including policy as you mentioned.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good afternoon.\nAndrew Young: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Just a question here on how you're thinking about the opportunity to invest for that account growth. You indicated the account growth is up, maybe give us a sense as to how much more it's up unusual? I know you usually don't give numbers for that, but it would be helpful to understand the benefit that those marketing dollars is generating today? And then how much more you think the opportunity set is here to ramp up the marketing in the back half of the year given the opportunity set that you have in front of you? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Betsy, yeah, we don't tend to give out the specific account growth numbers, the origination numbers. But they are strong right now. They're not the strongest that we have ever seen. And we're pleased that they're really quite strong because obviously, there was some weakness a year ago in those kind of numbers. So, we have seen a very solid performance. We feel really good about the account originations. So, we are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and also to just continue to build the underlying franchise. And as we've said, these opportunities are partly because of what the market has to give right now and partly opportunities that are enhanced by our technology transformation. And the marketing of course is especially going into the card side of the business, but also -- just look on TV, you've seen us steadily investing in national banking. We're very happy with how that's going. And you may have seen for the first time this quarter that we have now gone on National TV in the auto side. So, these are advertising that is debuting some of the technology innovations that we have at Capital One, some of the exceptional customer experiences that we've built. And we're seeing good traction in the origination side of the business. And so, we continue to lean into marketing.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hey, Rich. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the tech spend outlook. I saw a report that Capital One was hiring a large amount of software programmers to take advantage of the public cloud move. And then you mentioned FinTech, I was just curious if you thought that the regulatory landscape whenever balance out or is that sort of something that's not going to happen?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Yes, Don. Thank you. So, let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull off in business today. As -- you know, because while this principal is -- this talent principle is true in any business. It is profoundly true in technology as the demand for world-class tech talent vastly exceeds the supply. So, we've built a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent. And we're competing head-to-head with the leading technology companies in the US. And we've been leaning into tech hiring for years and this is a strong year of hiring. Most of the new roles we're hiring for are engineering roles in software development, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning. And these are the most sought-after roles in the world and we're getting real traction here. But essentially, if you pull way up and we -- it's more than just words when we say it, we've really been living this which is to from the ground up build a technology company that does banking essentially, what Capital One is. The technology and data are increasingly what the business is and at the heart of that journey is the tech talent. I also mentioned one other thing, Don, is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of our eyes and I wanted to flag that to investors. That is just something that -- again, it's the natural consequence of the demand greatly exceeding the supply. But -- so I think it's going to be hard for most companies, for all companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want. We are leaning into that. I think we're in a very good position. But it's -- we're going to need to pay appropriately for that talent. Don, you asked about FinTechs and what we feel about FinTechs, and possibly a comment on the regulatory side. I just have a tremendous interest in FinTechs, maybe that's because Capital One was an original FinTechs before there was such a word. And I look at the FinTech marketplace and I think some of these FinTechs are bringing great innovations to the market. And we very carefully study these innovations and I think that we look at these both as threats to our business, we look at them as opportunities. Maybe we can partner with the FinTechs, in some case, their acquisitions associated with that, and in some cases what they are doing as beacons of opportunity that we can pursue. The FinTechs today, I think what banks have to stare at is that FinTechs today are benefiting from their modern cloud-based technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting  markets, the tremendous amount of funding that is out there. I mean for example, these days, the venture capital funding going into FinTechs is close to I think, I don't have this data right in front of me, but it is close to double the next category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this. So this is pretty electrifying. And the FinTechs benefited from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have. Now, I don't think, right now, the success of FinTechs that one can look at FinTechs and say the primary reason they're succeeding in areas, sometimes more than the banks are, is because they are less regulated. I think they are succeeding for the factors that we talked about. I think when you look over time and envision these FinTechs with tremendous growth and being large disruptors, it is an elephant in the room relative to what's the regulatory context, the capital that they're going to be carrying, the regulatory requirements, and the levelness of the playing field. So, we certainly have a watchful eye on that. But when we look at the FinTechs, the success we're seeing in them, to me is indicative of the opportunity that exists to re-imagine banking. And that's what we've been focused on for years. And then if we kind of take our focus off of Fintechs for a minute and think about Capital One, like the FinTechs, we have a modern technology infrastructure based in the cloud. We also have other benefits they don't have. I have mentioned most of them. We have tremendous customer scale, a powerful brand, and literally decades of underwriting and banking experience. So, when I pull up, I think we and the FinTechs are well-positioned for success in some ways for the same reasons, in some ways for different reasons. But I think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is changing on an accelerated basis. The competition is unbelievably and increasingly well-funded and we look at that and we say it indicates the magnitude of change, the magnitude of the opportunity, but it also is a -- indicates an imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we need to invest, because these opportunities won't last forever. Thank you, Don.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I guess I had a follow-up question on the opportunity in US card for growth. I assume a lot of the account growth that you're seeing right now is coming in the super-prime or the transactor space because of the growth in transaction volumes. Is that correct? And I guess, if we think about the subprime consumer, maybe you could just talk about what their behaviors are today? And how do you see growth from that segment unfolding? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Sanjay, the -- certainly, what's the biggest newsworthy thing that's happening in the short run is the surge on the super-prime side, the return to travel and entertainment spend powered a lot by heavy spenders. And that you just can feel in a sense the world pent up and just bursting out. And I think that's sort of the biggest news that we see inside our numbers as we look at it. The subprime business I think has been more characteristic of in general, the sort of mass-market of America. And that is -- that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks nor are they -- is dramatic in terms of leaning in. But we've just continued to take the same strategy we've had in the subprime business really, in the prime business for years and we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise. And then at the right opportunities, raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant. So, we continue to lean into originations really, across our business and we are opening up credit lines -- gradually opening up credit lines because we see good results, the consumer is in a pretty good position, our customers are in a good place. And you remember, Sanjay, we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that. It's not like we're unleashing the credit lines right now, but we are sort of net-net more on the opening up side than the tightening side at the moment. And that's of course with a watchful eye on all the key indicators and things that naturally will change because of our credit market's work.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good evening, everyone.\nAndrew Young: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So, Rich, you mentioned several times that you're leaning into marketing. I guess from the outside looking in, how should we assess the return on these investments? Should it come in the form of accelerating growth or improved efficiency? And I guess, Rich, just on the efficiency point, we obviously saw improvement year-over-year for the first time in several quarters. It seems like the top line should be improving. This combined with the technology investments that you're making, at what point do you think you'll be ready to reintroduce the 42% efficiency target or what do we need to see for you to reinstate a timeline for that? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks. Well, first a word on marketing. As I said to Betsy, we are leaning into the marketing right now and sort of leaning a little further into it, because what we do is always so windows driven, as you know, Ryan. And so that's where we are in the marketing side. So, from an efficiency point of view, you notice pretty high levels of spending on marketing. That - marketing goes up, marketing goes down, but that at the moment is been more on the upside. Let me turn and - one thing I want to say about competition if I could just because this is very relevant to these growth conversations and then our pivot to the efficiency point. Most competitors have been - the feel of their earnings calls is they too are leaning into the opportunities that they see at the moment. And we see this - we see competition heating up all around us, especially in rewards. Typically, that's kind of the flashpoints where you see these things the most. But you see it in the marketing and the media activity, we see it in direct mail numbers, we see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that. And competition is intense right now, Ryan, but it's not yet irrational. But I want to just kind of take the moment to reflect on what I call sort of the physics of competitive cycles. Because I've seen this enough that it's pretty much you can count on these things happening, the timing is always the question. But right now, credit is historically good across the industry and the consumer is in great shape. The longer this persists, the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision-making. And this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers, market more intensely, and a particular one I worry about, loosening underwriting standards. And in this particular environment, the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on consumer credit data that frankly may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where credit performance is going to be over time. Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or two, what are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down. So the - and there is also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system, and then you've got the FinTechs that are really revving up as I talked about earlier. So the - there - even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle in the credit cycle, these seeds are being planted right now. And so, what we do is, we don't just look at our models to make decisions  way up and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these not only likely, basically inevitable things to happen and then we will act accordingly, we just never want to be surprised. Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with the combination of revenue growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress, particularly on revenue growth. As it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and frankly, particularly in banking. And so, as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can feel the clock ticking. Companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech readiness. The investment flowing into the FinTechs, the arms race for talent. And so, we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace, they are significant, but the windows aren't unlimited. So, we feel we're very well positioned on this. But, we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there. So, meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains, both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains. So, continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. We're still driving towards the same destination of operating efficiency, but the timing of our operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important pay-offs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Next, we'll hear from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Rich, as you think about the process of normalization of payment rates and revolve rates that you described, would you expect that to provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see loan growth outpace spending growth as we look ahead?\nRichard Fairbank: I think one of the things that I think the banking industry -- I mean, we've talked about this relationship between payment rates and growth from time to time but I think it's been more of an occasional conversation with the street. And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasn't talked about that much which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact, credit performance. And the striking thing is, it's not only empirical that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me really reinforces -- there is something very important here. And as I've said to you, we kind of route for higher payment rates. Because I think it reflects a healthier consumer even and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes paid very well as you can see here. But it is a natural thing that will happen over time, the normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates. And that in turn is likely sort of mathematically all other things being equal, that will be a boost to loan growth. So, when you say will -- but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to in fact, have loan growth lead the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us originations and things like that, that's got quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't, but I wouldn't run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the lead tables of the various growth metrics. But I think what is baking -- what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit, correspondingly for the same reason a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early -- sort of on a monthly basis, the very early indicators of that phenomenon.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good afternoon. Rich, appreciate your comments on FinTech and how you're looking at partnering, buying, and et cetera. But I just was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color and your thoughts around what areas of FinTech? I know, it's been a few years since you bought Paribus, the online price tracking. But there's a lot of -- there is, as you talk about all that investment, it's going into a very broad group of -- whether it's buy now pay later, B2B payments, wealth management, business spend management, kind of charge card business spend management areas. So I just wondered what areas are most attractive to you where we would see partnerships or acquisitions?\nRichard Fairbank: Bob, what we do is -- and you mentioned a bunch of interesting areas, for example. But what we do is rather than say these three areas are our priority areas and let's go look for FinTech. We have a -- and this is one of the -- really, one of the benefits of years on our tech transformation is we see opportunities in a lot of areas across the portfolio of businesses that we're in. And so, rather than say these three here are the priority, let's go see what we can partner with or buy. What we do is we massively study the FinTech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot. So -- and then what we do is, the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so, we go to school on this and we try to say -- a bunch of times, we say, wow, look at that. They thought us that idea. We did it in Capital One, they're good or bad but look, let's see what we can learn from that. And -- but also along the way. We look across that continuum of partnering, investing, or buying these things, but if we really look from the other end of the telescope rather than what we need, what we look for is what do we find -- and especially, what do we find relative to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us. And so, every once in a while we do an acquisition and -- but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model. We always ask ourselves, could we build that rather than buy it. And then we really look hard at the talent, because in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes, stays, and leads becomes leading executives in the company. And so, that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy anything but we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Well. Thanks, everybody for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Remember, Investor Relations team will be available in just a few minutes if you have any further questions. Have a great night.\nOperator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. And good evening everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balance and provision for credit losses improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Side 11. Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our domestic card business. As we emerge from the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments. Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results. Domestic card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw a growth of 17% versus 2019. T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June, T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019. At the end of the quarter, domestic card loan balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held for sale last year, second quarter ending loans declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5% ahead of typical seasonal growth of 2%. Moshe, as you know well because you've been there from the beginning in following us and having great insights. We really built our company as sort of wired for organic growth. We installed that in the founding days, what I call horizontal accounting where we track every action and cohort, and everything on a lifetime economic basis and we measure it before and during and afterward to see how it's going. And that -- and so, we always put organic at the top of the list. And here is a great example. I mean, while every bank that's -- every National Bank that's been created has come through many, many acquisitions. We've had some acquisitions in our journey but we are really leaning into an organically driven national growth strategy in banking. So -- and as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built in some of the innovations that we're rolling out. On -- with respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there is a spectrum on the technology side with respect to FinTechs and tech companies on the continuum at one end is, just being a partner with them and then next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake for example and then there are some times acquisitions. All of those have -- we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years, and I'm struck by the traction and success that we're having. When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little FinTechs for example and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance and in many ways, these things are generally outperforming. One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack so do the FinTechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so, the integration and the compatibility, the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past the -- sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in our favor. So, lots of positives there. There is one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side and that's the valuations. So, we've recently gone to several -- a few of these conversations and said, love the company but not at that price. So, we are very aware about the -- where pricing is but strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One it's an organic-first strategy but acquisitions of FinTechs and tech companies at the right price, usually be little ones, I think will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities. Kevin,  hearing that. But I think we -- it was a little echoey but I think we -- I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. From where we are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times. It's got a ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is because we want to be coy about it, but because in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days. What we like to talk about is the drivers. So, talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is, and I mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease , I think there is a bit of accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers. The -- so we -- there's really only one way for the credit to go from here and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a head start and I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on payment rates. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize. The directions are inevitable, the timing is speculative. Our view is during this period of time let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is but let's also be cognizant of how markets work -- how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating. Betsy, yeah, we don't tend to give out the specific account growth numbers, the origination numbers. But they are strong right now. They're not the strongest that we have ever seen. And we're pleased that they're really quite strong because obviously, there was some weakness a year ago in those kind of numbers. So, we have seen a very solid performance. We feel really good about the account originations. So, we are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and also to just continue to build the underlying franchise. And as we've said, these opportunities are partly because of what the market has to give right now and partly opportunities that are enhanced by our technology transformation. And the marketing of course is especially going into the card side of the business, but also -- just look on TV, you've seen us steadily investing in national banking. We're very happy with how that's going. And you may have seen for the first time this quarter that we have now gone on National TV in the auto side. So, these are advertising that is debuting some of the technology innovations that we have at Capital One, some of the exceptional customer experiences that we've built.

Thank you, Don. Sanjay, the -- certainly, what's the biggest newsworthy thing that's happening in the short run is the surge on the super-prime side, the return to travel and entertainment spend powered a lot by heavy spenders.

Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or two, what are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down. So the - and there is also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system, and then you've got the FinTechs that are really revving up as I talked about earlier. So the - there - even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle in the credit cycle, these seeds are being planted right now. And so, what we do is, we don't just look at our models to make decisions  way up and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these not only likely, basically inevitable things to happen and then we will act accordingly, we just never want to be surprised. Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with the combination of revenue growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress, particularly on revenue growth. As it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and frankly, particularly in banking. And so, as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can feel the clock ticking. Companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech readiness. The investment flowing into the FinTechs, the arms race for talent. And so, we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace, they are significant, but the windows aren't unlimited. So, we feel we're very well positioned on this. But, we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there. So, meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains, both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains. So, continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. We're still driving towards the same destination of operating efficiency, but the timing of our operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important pay-offs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value. I think one of the things that I think the banking industry -- I mean, we've talked about this relationship between payment rates and growth from time to time but I think it's been more of an occasional conversation with the street. And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasn't talked about that much which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact, credit performance. And the striking thing is, it's not only empirical that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me really reinforces -- there is something very important here. And as I've said to you, we kind of route for higher payment rates. Because I think it reflects a healthier consumer even and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes paid very well as you can see here. But it is a natural thing that will happen over time, the normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates. And that in turn is likely sort of mathematically all other things being equal, that will be a boost to loan growth. So, when you say will -- but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to in fact, have loan growth lead the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us originations and things like that, that's got quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't, but I wouldn't run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the lead tables of the various growth metrics. But I think what is baking -- what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit, correspondingly for the same reason a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early -- sort of on a monthly basis, the very early indicators of that phenomenon. Bob, what we do is -- and you mentioned a bunch of interesting areas, for example. But what we do is rather than say these three areas are our priority areas and let's go look for FinTech. We have a -- and this is one of the -- really, one of the benefits of years on our tech transformation is we see opportunities in a lot of areas across the portfolio of businesses that we're in. And so, rather than say these three here are the priority, let's go see what we can partner with or buy. What we do is we massively study the FinTech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot. So -- and then what we do is, the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so, we go to school on this and we try to say -- a bunch of times, we say, wow, look at that. They thought us that idea. We did it in Capital One, they're good or bad but look, let's see what we can learn from that. And -- but also along the way. We look across that continuum of partnering, investing, or buying these things, but if we really look from the other end of the telescope rather than what we need, what we look for is what do we find -- and especially, what do we find relative to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us. And so, every once in a while we do an acquisition and -- but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model. We always ask ourselves, could we build that rather than buy it. And then we really look hard at the talent, because in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes, stays, and leads becomes leading executives in the company. And so, that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy anything but we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71. On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs with offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release. Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of a strong domestic card purchase volume on non-interest income, and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investments grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held for sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held for sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an international card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance, primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. Turning to Slide 5, we provide to be allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes. You know, John, in our card business, payment rates remain at historically high levels. And as you know, government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer balance sheets are extremely healthy and payment rates remain elevated. You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics. And while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels and these high payment rates are muting balance growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So, we actually are always happy when our customers are paying in high levels and it's indicative of a healthy consumer. And those high-payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see. We are -- if we look at the monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that would be a trend to indicate. It's certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more and they're going out, returning hopefully back to normal, it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move toward normalizing a little bit. So I guess, John, I would say, we've seen the earliest of indications of that. It's still running at really quite a breathtaking level. Thanks, Rick. This is Andrew. I'll take that. I think as we look at the allowance, every quarter we're going to take into account a large number of variables and assumptions which would certainly take policy and other factors. And so, as I reflect back on the ratio that we had upon adoption, a lot of things have changed since then. And so, within every single asset class, the mix is going to impact our coverage needs and then you look at overall the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things. So, I look at all of those factors and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also think that if you put into the formula, like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like. But again, it will take into account each successive quarter all of the things that we're looking at in terms of the mix and broad economic assumptions, including policy as you mentioned. Hey, Betsy. Hey, Ryan."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Capital One First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Keith, and welcome everybody to Capital One's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the Internet. To access the call on the Internet, please logon to the Capital One website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our first quarter 2021 results.\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings increased 1% in the quarter to $3.4 billion and we recorded a provision benefit of $823 million. After recognizing $535 million of gains during 2021 on our Snowflake investment, we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of $75 million or $0.12 per share. We've now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of $460 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance. The release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. Our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns. And despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties. Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment. After the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter. Our Branded Card coverage is 12.1%. Recall that the difference between Branded and Domestic coverage is driven by the loss-sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio. Coverage in our consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%, and coverage in our commercial banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and it's great to have you as our CFO. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter, driven by the continuing impact of the pandemic. Purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020. And the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the story of our Domestic Card business continues to be two sides of the same coin. Historically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continue to put pressure on loan balances. And on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance.\nJeff Norris: Thank you. Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. And if you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  We\u2019ll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good evening. Want to see if you could talk a little bit about the long growth outlook, perhaps maybe a timing of the inflection, just given us as stimulus benefits, ultimately abate and payment rates peak. And I want to see similarly when you would expect to see that peaking of payment rates or at least an inflection there. Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: All right. Thanks, John. Good evening. The growth story is, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re mostly focused on card with that question, so let me turn there. It is really striking that of all the asset classes, one really stands sort of unique in the industry as the one asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic and that\u2019s Credit Card. And of course that\u2019s because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product. In the current environment, the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior, and of course the traction that we\u2019re getting in the marketplace. Let\u2019s just talk about spend for a minute, which is recovering.\nJohn Pancari: Thanks, Rich, for all that detail. That\u2019s helpful. Just one quick follow-up on the marketing side and you indicated that you\u2019re still continuing to lean in there. The low single-digit growth year-over-year marketing expense was better than we had expected. Could you just possibly give us a way to think about how much of a lean in that you\u2019re looking at here incrementally as we look at the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, John. So, from marketing point of view, this first and foremost is going to be powered by what we see on the opportunity to grow originations. Marketing and originations are really something that\u2019s very linked, of course, outstandings growth is not as closely linked in time or as directly. But so we see good opportunities to grow account originations and we\u2019re investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities. In card, we\u2019re certainly \u2013 in all our businesses, we\u2019re leaning in where we see some signs of strength. We also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience we\u2019re building, some of the benefits of our technology we\u2019re building, and that\u2019s part of our story that gets reflected in the marketing. And that\u2019s something that powers the growth as well. And then we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. So that\u2019s why it kind of pulling way up with the collective set of opportunities we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re continuing to lean in to the market.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening, guys. Maybe to ask about capital. So, if I look at the 11% target, you have over $10.5 billion of excess, you\u2019ve got $3.5 billion of reserves above day one. And if I look at expectations, I think the market\u2019s looking for almost $10 billion of earnings the next few quarters. So I wanted to get a sense for how we should think about capital allocation, timing of the execution of the $7.5 billion you previously announced. And could we see either upsizing of the current program into the next year, or how do we think about the ability to sustain capital returns at these levels? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Sure, Ryan. I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Andrew. The first thing I would highlight is, as you know, we\u2019re still under the capital preservation rules from the Fed. So in the second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our repurchase capacity is going to be limited to just under $1.7 billion and we will also be limited to our prior dividend. And so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position, and at least the prospects of earnings from here. So how quickly we complete that $7.5 billion that the board has already authorized is going to tieback to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions, but also trading volumes in our stock, and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position. But what I can say is we\u2019re excited at the prospect of moving under the SCB framework in the third quarter. So we\u2019ll have more flexibility in our choices looking ahead.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Rich, you mentioned the strikingly strong credit backdrop. I\u2019m just curious, using your analogy of sort of borrowing through the mountain, so do you think we\u2019d get through to the other side with this round of stimulus? And maybe I\u2019ll just ask my follow-up now. Andrew, maybe you could just give us some sense of how the NIM projects for the rest of the year, understanding there\u2019s different puts and takes, maybe you could just walk us through your sort of baseline assumption? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Yes, Sanjay. So I think the main factor, particularly in the near-term with NIM is going to depend on how that pandemic impacts our balance sheet. Most notably what you\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters in terms of asset mix and deposit balances and our cash position, I think those are the things that are mostly going to have the impact for the next few quarters. I think over the longer term, I\u2019d expect our cash position and the size of the investment portfolio to come back down to more normal levels, I\u2019ll call it, and be a tailwind to NIM all else equal. But it\u2019s again important to know that the uncertainty of what we\u2019re seeing in deposit volumes and the impact of payment rates, as Rich said on loan growth, those are all factors that are going to create some variability and uncertainty in them in the near-term.\nRichard Fairbank: And Sanjay, with respect to your credit question and the burrowing through the mountain metaphor, let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about what\u2019s going on with credit. The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilience. And consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the great recession, lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector. And because everything sort of went into vertical, a drop at once as the pandemic began, they certainly reacted strongly and rationally, and launched this trilogy of behaviors of spending less, saving more and paying down debt. And then of course, the year end of the pandemic, direct government support to consumers, including enhanced unemployment benefits remains in place. And in fact, last month, in March, was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began. And the consumer savings rate was 17% in the first two months of 2021 more than doubled what we saw before the pandemic and something like five times what it was in the years before the great recession. And then we also have the forbearance factor. Although forbearance is winding down in card and auto, it is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages. And as we\u2019ve said before, the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative to some extent, improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits. And now to the metaphor that I know I use all the time, every month that the consumer remains healthy, we\u2019re burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment. And we\u2019re reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts. Now we should all keep in mind a few things here. There remains a great deal of uncertainty. As you know, COVID cases remain elevated, new variants continue to emerge. And while the U.S. has been moving in a pretty good direction, of course, a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to COVID. The economy while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it. And so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit. But we should all keep in mind, the uncertainty that still remains out there. And then there\u2019s one other point that I just like to put on the table here. In the spirit of pattern recognition, I do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point. And let me elaborate on that just for a moment here. Reliance on consumer credit characteristics that may be more temporary driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling. And the benign rear view mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards, which as you know, can invite adverse selection. And then overlay on top of that, the excess liquidity and capital that\u2019s out there, and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business. So what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now. We\u2019re also watching the physics of how markets, not only economic markets, but how credit markets work. And so what we\u2019re doing at Capital One is leaning into the opportunities that we have. But by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work, we\u2019re very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make. And it\u2019s again, another reason why we\u2019re focusing as always on making sure that we book resilient business. So pulling way up, we\u2019re not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain. And we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as the consequences of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts. But those are some thoughts on the credit environment, Sanjay.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Rich, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on used car values in April? We\u2019ve heard from some competitors that cars are barely on the lot for a day. And then what is your strategy on loan growth? Because competition obviously is picking up across the board, yet the returns are still very attractive. How are you thinking about that business?\nRichard Fairbank: So, Don, the used car prices are pretty electrifying here. Auction prices ended the quarter at all-time high, driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicles supply. And over time we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicles supply constraints work themselves out. But the time horizon for normalization has expanded given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chains. So for example, microprocessors shortages have held back new vehicle production for some time. The first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events, and that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts. And then most recently rubber shortages have manifested themselves. So the supply is shortage, there are signs of it everywhere. And for example, we see rental car companies are normally a source of used vehicle supply, but they have very lean fleets at the moment with little access to sell. So we still expect auction prices to normalize over time. And a very important thing is in our underwriting, we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization now. With that very unusual context there, and again, my view is that we cannot underwrite under an assumption that we\u2019re going to get the benefit of those things. It\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re enjoying on our portfolio. But as we always do, and particularly at this point, we need to look past that in our underwriting and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re doing. With respect to growth, industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in March. And in addition to tax refund seasonality, I\u2019m sure payments, stimulus payments likely really held strong sales both in the new and the used vehicle segments. So at Capital One over the course of the pandemic, we actually have \u2013 we tightened up in certain segments, especially, early on, but we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset. We\u2019re watching things closely, but we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry, certainly it\u2019s been a very exceptional time. But also on top of that, our investments in industry-leading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in-person face-to-face interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers. So we have found on top of the rising tide, maybe a little bit of extra boost at Capital One, but I've also said that even more so than the card business, the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition. And that's because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesn't happen in a direct-to-consumer business like card. So it's not lost on us that \u2013 the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business, so what we're going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment. But again to use my physics term, again, really keep a watchful eye on the physics of how the markets work and be looking for some of those things that can come on the side of excessive competition, as well as over time a breaking of the extraordinary things going on, a normalization of the used car prices.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Shane, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. When we look at the non-interest income, particularly in the domestic card business, it seems to be decoupling and outperforming the increase in spend. I'm curious how much of that is being driven by some sort of release of suppressed fees or how we should be thinking about catalysts for that?\nAndrew Young: Hey, Rick, it's Andrew. This suppression is actually flowing through net interest income. So that's not driving it. I think the biggest driver, if you're looking at it on a margin basis is we're seeing spend volume and interchange spend growing at a faster rate than loans. So that's providing a little bit of a tailwind to non-interest income as it relates to overall revenue margin in card.\nRick Shane: Okay, great. That \u2013 I think that helps, but if we look at the year-over-year increase in spend and we look at the year-over-year increase in non-interest income, there's still a pretty significant gap. One of the things that's always a little bit hard to figure out with Capital One is where some of the rewards run through, is it a function potentially of lower rewards rates given what's going on in the market or is there something else as well?\nAndrew Young: Yeah, I don't think there's a big story there with respect to rewards or interchange Rick.\nRick Shane: Okay. I will follow up offline, thank you guys.\nAndrew Young: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Rich I was hoping to go back to the competitive dynamic, maybe a little less from a credit standpoint, but you guys have taken some actions recently with respect to your T&E products. Just talk a little bit about the rewards environment at your high end consumers, and then maybe the things that you did discuss with respect to kind of concerns about the competitive environment and what it kind of, how it informs your credit line increase side of the business?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers, including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing and other things. Competitive intensity is back to a tie levels, particularly as you point to Moshe in the reward space, at the higher end, the heavy spender end. Let's talk about marketing, marketing and media spend obviously dropped dramatically in the second quarter and since then activity has steadily increased. We get our data on a bit of a lag basis, but I feel it's very likely that marketing levels are now at or above pre-pandemic levels. The rewards offerings remain intense. And let's talk about some of the elements of that. Upfront bonuses have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases, mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand. As far as for rewards earned on spend, we've seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year. And while the shifts have slowed down, reward levels overall remain high. And we've even seen a couple of a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here. So I think it's a very natural thing that's happened with spending having been way down. And also some of the things Moshe that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now. There's been somewhat of a mixed change and I think a forward lean by the industry on this. So I think it's \u2013 the thing that I've said so often about the card business, these days, I think it's very competitive industry, but there's a rationality to it that I'm pretty struck by and one that I would not use, some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that we're in. So what are we doing, we are continuing to look at our opportunities lean into where we have opportunities. I think we feel good with the general structure of the rewards products we have, but we do know that competition is high and it's probably going to be increasing. We ourselves are going to lean into to marketing and \u2013 but, I don't necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there to change to us the attractiveness of this. Part of the thing is, most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin, because while interchange rates are high, we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals. So pulling way up, we continue to like our opportunities. We have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity and I think we should probably prepare for that.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Then on the other side of the  increases, yeah.\nRichard Fairbank: Sorry, Moshe. Yeah. So as you know gosh, think about the number of years we talked about even before that the pandemic probably for 18 months, maybe Moshe we were talking about kind of pulling back onlines when the \u2013 we were \u2013 the recovery was so long in the tooth and we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace. So we took a pretty conservative policy with lines. And then during the pandemic, we took a particularly conservative strategy with lines. And so that contains some potential energy, as we've always talked about. It turns into kinetic energy when of course, we grant the line increases and there's more opportunity for people to spend. And the opening of lines has been something we've been doing over the last number of months. It's been kind of invisible with \u2013 to the outside world in terms of growth, because it's getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates, but we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually and Moshe, I think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity. We're not doing anything really dramatic, but it's just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what we're seeing with the performance of our customers.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening. I'll ask my questions upfront on efficiency. Rich, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the strategic significance of your physical branch footprint? Is there any room for the branch optimization, either to fund further investments in the digitization of the business or simply extract greater efficiencies? And then also, if you could give us an update on the cloud migration, that would be great.\nAndrew Young: Okay. Bill, so let me start with the branches, as you know Capital One has over the years sort of leaned into the closing branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business, and also the \u2013 all the digital investments we were making, because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesn't need to have a branch on every corner. And we've been pleased with our strategy so far. But there's \u2013 we don't, I think there's more of a continuation of where we are, I think we're in \u2013 continuing to lean into the same strategy we've had for quite a period of time there. So I wouldn't look at our network and say, wow, there's a huge kind of potential to unleash there. We've just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities, watching customer behavior and then just continue down the same path. With respect to our cloud strategy, as you know we completely exited data centers last year. So we are 100% in the cloud. And we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud, the hassle free access to infrastructure. The ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation that's happening on the cloud, both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud. So this is something we've been, you know many years in the making and we're happy to be all-in on the cloud. But it doesn't mean our journey is done on the cloud we find as we get there, there's \u2013 the opportunity to build many more capabilities, the opportunity to really enhance resilience, operating resilience, fail over capabilities, efficiency, the ability to over time move. Basically one of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that they're operating on. And the cloud itself is in an abstractor of that the infrastructure worked for a developer, but within \u2013 if you just look at what's happening to cloud, the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers, and now where it's going with serverless, just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do, which is to create great things and ship products. Now, all of that doesn't happen automatically, companies have to continue to stay on the forefront. So Capital One is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business for example, as we continue to move the level of abstraction up the tech stack and create opportunity for the software to be developed faster, more effectively and safer.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good afternoon.\nRichard Fairbank: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I had a couple of questions one on \u2013 just Rich, in thinking about the marketing investment spend and also the opportunity to pick up some new customers. Just wanted to understand the kind of timeframe that you think you'll be getting that return on investment relative to maybe pre-COVID? And I'm wondering if it might be a longer timeframe to get that return on investment, given the stimulus that's in people's pockets right now, or could it be the same because the target market you're going after is not a stimulus receiver, just trying to think out loud about how that's going to happen?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, the first thing to think about marketing always is good marketing, while it can influence balance levels, marketing is really about growth of a franchise, growth of accounts and building brand and those kinds of things. So I think a way to think about the pandemic is that it took a company like Capital One and our card business, and just set us back like 15% behind the starting line. And that's a pretty jarring thing to happen in our flagship business in a very successful and profitable business, but this whole payment phenomenon essentially did that. Now in that context, as we start farther behind the starting line, as we look at the opportunity to grow accounts, the opportunity to build the franchise, the opportunity to get out there with some of our really great digital products and things like this, the ability to \u2013 and of course on the banking side, the ability to grow the national bank that is still very \u2013 that opportunity is still very much there. And isn't really \u2013 it isn't really that changed by the pandemic. Now on the outstanding side, first of all have the pay-down story. So that definitely is pushing us and others farther back, all other things being equal. There's the \u2013 sort of the issue for how much credit demand there that we'll see from folks on that. We certainly have the spend weakness on the travel side of the business as well. So I think that we feel the effectiveness of our marketing in building the franchise is very much like it was before. The outstandings metrics of the company started farther behind and they have headwinds to them. But \u2013 since we've always talked about, if payment rates stay high, we're going to have to live with all the great credit performance that we have, and the earnings and the ability to distribute capital. So the benefits come in a different way, but we are very focused on continuing to build the franchise. And I think Capital One is in a similar position to do that as we were pre-pandemic in many ways, maybe even a little bit better position, because we're farther along on our tech transformation. Do you have follow-up Betsy?\nOperator: We'll take our final question this evening from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Afternoon, thanks for fitting me in here. You've talked about competition quite a bit on this call, but maybe an extension at it, I guess, how does the calculus of competition change with all these Neo banks and the other kind of digital product platforms you're competing for first time customers? Does it change anything with respect to the opportunity set?\nRichard Fairbank: John, let's talk about that from a couple of perspectives. First of all, as I often say, Capital One was one of the original fintechs before anybody used that word. So I think fintechs are particularly near and dear to my heart and I watch with tremendous interest. The growth of fintechs, there are some of the really clever innovation they're coming up with, we should all know of course, that all of these fintechs are born in the cloud, they're starting with modern technology, and that already gives them a bunch of advantages relative to a lot of banks. I think, Capital One being in the cloud, I think has been \u2013 it's in a sort of much better position competitively relative to that, but we \u2013 what we should all favor about the fintechs is the modern tech platform they have and that's \u2013 it's always \u2013 and I think those advantages are larger nowadays than they were in the past, because the difference between being built on a modern tech stack versus not is just a greater advantage and something that's motivated us to do a very big tech transformation as you know. So the \u2013 and the fintechs journey is not just sort of use some clever technology, they're also very much positioning themselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities to gather more data, different data than typically gathered and to leverage it in real time, so there are some bunch of impressive things there. When we look at the fintechs, we are both generally impressed. We think that they do represent threats to the business, but to us I think they are very much also just a good examples of the kind of innovation that's possible and the kind of innovation that companies like Capital One who are in the cloud with on a modern tech stack, the kind of things that we can do as well. So we look at it from that perspective and we fire it, worrying and inspiring at the same time. Then you have the lending side of business. I want to make a special comment about lending. Half an hour ago, I put a caution note out there that we've got to \u2013 that I worry about we are in the marketplace lending goes from here with people building models that are looking at a recession that was very, very unusual with sort of spectacular credit. And I worry particularly about fintechs who are not that experienced in some of the credit choices they can do and the impact on our marketplace. So I think the fintechs and you can see in the commentary by banks, I think banks are becoming a lot more sort of realizing the scale, the growth, the collective size of the growth rate and the innovation that the fintechs are bringing. And they're going to be a force to reckon with, and to us there are continued impetus that we've got to lean forward, we've got to continue on our tech transformation, and we need to lead the way ourselves with innovation.\nJohn Hecht: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference this evening, and thanks for your interest in Capital One. And as a reminder, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any further questions you might have. Have a great night everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and it's great to have you as our CFO. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter, driven by the continuing impact of the pandemic. Purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020. And the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the story of our Domestic Card business continues to be two sides of the same coin. Historically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continue to put pressure on loan balances. And on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance. All right. Thanks, John. Good evening. The growth story is, I'm sure you're mostly focused on card with that question, so let me turn there. It is really striking that of all the asset classes, one really stands sort of unique in the industry as the one asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic and that's Credit Card. And of course that's because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product. In the current environment, the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior, and of course the traction that we're getting in the marketplace. Let's just talk about spend for a minute, which is recovering. Thank you, John. So, from marketing point of view, this first and foremost is going to be powered by what we see on the opportunity to grow originations. Marketing and originations are really something that's very linked, of course, outstandings growth is not as closely linked in time or as directly. But so we see good opportunities to grow account originations and we're investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities. In card, we're certainly \u2013 in all our businesses, we're leaning in where we see some signs of strength. We also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience we're building, some of the benefits of our technology we're building, and that's part of our story that gets reflected in the marketing. And that's something that powers the growth as well. And then we're continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. So that's why it kind of pulling way up with the collective set of opportunities we're seeing we're continuing to lean in to the market. And Sanjay, with respect to your credit question and the burrowing through the mountain metaphor, let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about what's going on with credit. The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilience. And consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the great recession, lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector. And because everything sort of went into vertical, a drop at once as the pandemic began, they certainly reacted strongly and rationally, and launched this trilogy of behaviors of spending less, saving more and paying down debt. And then of course, the year end of the pandemic, direct government support to consumers, including enhanced unemployment benefits remains in place. And in fact, last month, in March, was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began. And the consumer savings rate was 17% in the first two months of 2021 more than doubled what we saw before the pandemic and something like five times what it was in the years before the great recession. And then we also have the forbearance factor. Although forbearance is winding down in card and auto, it is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages. And as we've said before, the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative to some extent, improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits. And now to the metaphor that I know I use all the time, every month that the consumer remains healthy, we're burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment. And we're reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts. Now we should all keep in mind a few things here. There remains a great deal of uncertainty. As you know, COVID cases remain elevated, new variants continue to emerge. And while the U.S. has been moving in a pretty good direction, of course, a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to COVID. The economy while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it. And so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit. But we should all keep in mind, the uncertainty that still remains out there. And then there's one other point that I just like to put on the table here. In the spirit of pattern recognition, I do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point. And let me elaborate on that just for a moment here. Reliance on consumer credit characteristics that may be more temporary driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling. And the benign rear view mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards, which as you know, can invite adverse selection. And then overlay on top of that, the excess liquidity and capital that's out there, and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business. So what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now. We're also watching the physics of how markets, not only economic markets, but how credit markets work. And so what we're doing at Capital One is leaning into the opportunities that we have. But by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work, we're very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make. And it's again, another reason why we're focusing as always on making sure that we book resilient business. So pulling way up, we're not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain. And we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as the consequences of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts. But those are some thoughts on the credit environment, Sanjay. So, Don, the used car prices are pretty electrifying here. Auction prices ended the quarter at all-time high, driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicles supply. And over time we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicles supply constraints work themselves out. But the time horizon for normalization has expanded given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chains. So for example, microprocessors shortages have held back new vehicle production for some time. The first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events, and that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts. And then most recently rubber shortages have manifested themselves. So the supply is shortage, there are signs of it everywhere. And for example, we see rental car companies are normally a source of used vehicle supply, but they have very lean fleets at the moment with little access to sell. So we still expect auction prices to normalize over time. And a very important thing is in our underwriting, we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization now. With that very unusual context there, and again, my view is that we cannot underwrite under an assumption that we're going to get the benefit of those things. It's certainly something we're enjoying on our portfolio. But as we always do, and particularly at this point, we need to look past that in our underwriting and that's certainly what we're doing. With respect to growth, industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in March. And in addition to tax refund seasonality, I'm sure payments, stimulus payments likely really held strong sales both in the new and the used vehicle segments. So at Capital One over the course of the pandemic, we actually have \u2013 we tightened up in certain segments, especially, early on, but we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset. We're watching things closely, but we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry, certainly it's been a very exceptional time. But also on top of that, our investments in industry-leading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in-person face-to-face interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers. So we have found on top of the rising tide, maybe a little bit of extra boost at Capital One, but I've also said that even more so than the card business, the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition. And that's because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesn't happen in a direct-to-consumer business like card. So it's not lost on us that \u2013 the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business, so what we're going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment. But again to use my physics term, again, really keep a watchful eye on the physics of how the markets work and be looking for some of those things that can come on the side of excessive competition, as well as over time a breaking of the extraordinary things going on, a normalization of the used car prices. Okay. Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers, including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing and other things. Competitive intensity is back to a tie levels, particularly as you point to Moshe in the reward space, at the higher end, the heavy spender end. Let's talk about marketing, marketing and media spend obviously dropped dramatically in the second quarter and since then activity has steadily increased. We get our data on a bit of a lag basis, but I feel it's very likely that marketing levels are now at or above pre-pandemic levels. The rewards offerings remain intense. And let's talk about some of the elements of that. Upfront bonuses have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases, mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand. As far as for rewards earned on spend, we've seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year. And while the shifts have slowed down, reward levels overall remain high. And we've even seen a couple of a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here. So I think it's a very natural thing that's happened with spending having been way down. And also some of the things Moshe that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now. There's been somewhat of a mixed change and I think a forward lean by the industry on this. So I think it's \u2013 the thing that I've said so often about the card business, these days, I think it's very competitive industry, but there's a rationality to it that I'm pretty struck by and one that I would not use, some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that we're in. So what are we doing, we are continuing to look at our opportunities lean into where we have opportunities. I think we feel good with the general structure of the rewards products we have, but we do know that competition is high and it's probably going to be increasing. We ourselves are going to lean into to marketing and \u2013 but, I don't necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there to change to us the attractiveness of this. Part of the thing is, most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin, because while interchange rates are high, we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals. So pulling way up, we continue to like our opportunities. We have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity and I think we should probably prepare for that. Sorry, Moshe. Yeah. So as you know gosh, think about the number of years we talked about even before that the pandemic probably for 18 months, maybe Moshe we were talking about kind of pulling back onlines when the \u2013 we were \u2013 the recovery was so long in the tooth and we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace. So we took a pretty conservative policy with lines. And then during the pandemic, we took a particularly conservative strategy with lines. And so that contains some potential energy, as we've always talked about. It turns into kinetic energy when of course, we grant the line increases and there's more opportunity for people to spend. And the opening of lines has been something we've been doing over the last number of months. It's been kind of invisible with \u2013 to the outside world in terms of growth, because it's getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates, but we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually and Moshe, I think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity. We're not doing anything really dramatic, but it's just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what we're seeing with the performance of our customers. Hey, Betsy. Well, the first thing to think about marketing always is good marketing, while it can influence balance levels, marketing is really about growth of a franchise, growth of accounts and building brand and those kinds of things.

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings increased 1% in the quarter to $3.4 billion and we recorded a provision benefit of $823 million. After recognizing $535 million of gains during 2021 on our Snowflake investment, we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of $75 million or $0.12 per share. We've now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of $460 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance. The release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. Our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns. And despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties. Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment. After the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter. Our Branded Card coverage is 12.1%. Recall that the difference between Branded and Domestic coverage is driven by the loss-sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio. Coverage in our consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%, and coverage in our commercial banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%. Sure, Ryan. I'll take that. It's Andrew. The first thing I would highlight is, as you know, we're still under the capital preservation rules from the Fed. So in the second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our repurchase capacity is going to be limited to just under $1.7 billion and we will also be limited to our prior dividend. And so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position, and at least the prospects of earnings from here. So how quickly we complete that $7.5 billion that the board has already authorized is going to tieback to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions, but also trading volumes in our stock, and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position. But what I can say is we're excited at the prospect of moving under the SCB framework in the third quarter. So we'll have more flexibility in our choices looking ahead. Yes, Sanjay. So I think the main factor, particularly in the near-term with NIM is going to depend on how that pandemic impacts our balance sheet. Most notably what you've seen over the last few quarters in terms of asset mix and deposit balances and our cash position, I think those are the things that are mostly going to have the impact for the next few quarters. I think over the longer term, I'd expect our cash position and the size of the investment portfolio to come back down to more normal levels, I'll call it, and be a tailwind to NIM all else equal. But it's again important to know that the uncertainty of what we're seeing in deposit volumes and the impact of payment rates, as Rich said on loan growth, those are all factors that are going to create some variability and uncertainty in them in the near-term. Hey, Rick, it's Andrew. This suppression is actually flowing through net interest income. So that's not driving it. I think the biggest driver, if you're looking at it on a margin basis is we're seeing spend volume and interchange spend growing at a faster rate than loans. So that's providing a little bit of a tailwind to non-interest income as it relates to overall revenue margin in card. Yeah, I don't think there's a big story there with respect to rewards or interchange Rick. Thank you. Okay. Bill, so let me start with the branches, as you know Capital One has over the years sort of leaned into the closing branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business, and also the \u2013 all the digital investments we were making, because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesn't need to have a branch on every corner. And we've been pleased with our strategy so far. But there's \u2013 we don't, I think there's more of a continuation of where we are, I think we're in \u2013 continuing to lean into the same strategy we've had for quite a period of time there. So I wouldn't look at our network and say, wow, there's a huge kind of potential to unleash there. We've just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities, watching customer behavior and then just continue down the same path. With respect to our cloud strategy, as you know we completely exited data centers last year. So we are 100% in the cloud. And we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud, the hassle free access to infrastructure. The ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation that's happening on the cloud, both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud. So this is something we've been, you know many years in the making and we're happy to be all-in on the cloud. But it doesn't mean our journey is done on the cloud we find as we get there, there's \u2013 the opportunity to build many more capabilities, the opportunity to really enhance resilience, operating resilience, fail over capabilities, efficiency, the ability to over time move. Basically one of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that they're operating on. And the cloud itself is in an abstractor of that the infrastructure worked for a developer, but within \u2013 if you just look at what's happening to cloud, the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers, and now where it's going with serverless, just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do, which is to create great things and ship products. Now, all of that doesn't happen automatically, companies have to continue to stay on the forefront. So Capital One is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business for example, as we continue to move the level of abstraction up the tech stack and create opportunity for the software to be developed faster, more effectively and safer."

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start on slide 3 of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items, which collectively benefited pretax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings performance share were $17.71. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our domestic car business. This loan growth coupled with net interest margin expansion drove revenue up 3% on a linked quarter basis. Noninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter \u2013 provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion. Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%. I\u2019ll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%. Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter. The impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis-point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates. The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. And finally, in our Commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis-point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio. Turning to page 6, I\u2019ll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion. Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings. Turning to page 7, I\u2019ll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The 4 basis-point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards car loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Ending loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter. And revenue was up 19% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points. Noninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We\u2019re seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 6% year-over-year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. Consumer Banking revenue was up 10% year-over-year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat. Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was therefore neutral to the Company. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% year-over-year. Noninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%. In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.  Charge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we\u2019re continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. We\u2019re focusing on efficiency improvement and we\u2019re managing capital prudently. As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we\u2019re in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to our other investors and analysts who might wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Victor, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from line of Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to ask about just the vintage seasoning or growth math as you talk \u2013 as I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past. We\u2019ve added a lot of loans here in last year. And as these loans season, I was just trying to \u2013 wonder if you could maybe talk about just how you see that flowing through into your loss rates and what that does to your delinquency and loss goes here over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Thank you. Let me just start with a reminder of what we mean by growth math. As a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and then gradually come down. When we accelerate growth and especially when those new loans are added to a seasoned back book with low losses, it can increase the overall level of losses of a portfolio. We grew rapidly \u2013 for example, just looking back at when we talk a lot about growth math, we grew rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and had a particularly visible growth math effect in the wake of that growth. At that time, the large front book was adding to a back book that was unusually seasoned because it had survived the Great Recession. Given our recent rate of growth, I think it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see some growth math effect again over the next few years. But I think the general normalization trend will be the bigger driver of our credit trajectory. One other thing that\u2019s different about growth math going forward is CECL. Under the CECL accounting regime, the allowance impact of new growth are pulled forward significantly. We haven\u2019t seen this effect for most of the pandemic, even as we have accelerated our growth because of the offsetting favorable factors in our allowance. But as our growth continues, a portion of our allowance builds going forward are intended to support that growth.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe on your reserve. Just trying to understand just some of the assumptions underlying the reserves. Maybe you could just talk about what you\u2019re assuming for unemployment whether you have a recession built into the short term. Any additional color you can help us with there? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Sure Mihir. As I said in the past, we are largely consumers of economic assumptions. In this particular case for unemployment, we are assuming something that\u2019s a little modestly higher than consensus estimates for where we will land in the fourth quarter. I think consensus is somewhere around 4.8. We\u2019re \u2013 our baseline forecast gets up to around 5% in the fourth quarter. But it\u2019s important to note there\u2019s a lot of other things that go into the calculation of the reserve, things like unemployment \u2013 sorry, changes in the unemployment rate, inflation, home prices, wages, all of those factors matter as well, but our unemployment assumption is to be around 4% in the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, around 5% in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sharma with Capital One.\nJeff Norris: Hey Victor, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\nRyan Nash: Was that intended for me, Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Hey Ryan, why you don\u2019t go ahead.\nRyan Nash: So Rich, maybe I can ask Mihir\u2019s \u2013 one of Mihir\u2019s questions in a slightly different manner. So, competitors in the industry are talking about reaching pre-pandemic loss levels by year-end or maybe even overshooting those levels. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the pace of normalization or maybe even overshooting those? And maybe just talk a little bit about normalization versus parts of the portfolio if you\u2019re actually seeing any deterioration. Thanks. And I have a follow-up.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So consumer credit metrics remain strong. And of course, as we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019ve been normalizing steadily through 2022 and are approaching pre-pandemic levels. At first, normalization was more pronounced in some segments more than others. It was \u2013 of course \u2013 and by the way, this is always the case that front book, new originations tend to be higher. So, that would have been shocking, had it been different. But the other thing we also said and talked to investors about it was more \u2013 normalization was happening everywhere, but it was more pronounced at the lower end of the market.  More recently, we\u2019ve actually seen more uniform trend of normalization across businesses and segments, so, for example, across various FICO ranges and also across income levels. When we index them on credit metrics back to where they were before the pandemic, the sort of rest of the credit spectrum and rest of the income spectrums caught up to the, very recently in the last few months, to the lower end. So really, if I pull on that, it looks like the normalization is pretty consistent across the board. And \u2013 yes, go ahead, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: No, no, go for it. I\u2019ll ask my follow-up when you finish.\nRichard Fairbank: So, you asked various competitors are forecasting or talking about different times at which things cross 2019 levels. I think at Capital One, we\u2019re not making specific predictions on that. But I think the key thing I would have you look at is the delinquency metrics. Delinquency metrics are the best single predictor of where things are going to go in the near term. And in fact, if we look at flow rates, we can see that very early flow rates into delinquency buckets are pretty normalized. So, we\u2019re not giving specific guidance. But we would say, look at the credit metrics, look at the dynamics across other metrics, but we feel this is \u2013 it\u2019s clearly normalizing as we see it.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And then, Rich, maybe to follow up on the comments regarding the efficiency being flat to modestly down. I think last quarter, you were talking about modest efficiency improvements. There have been headlines about the firm reducing some headcount. So, I\u2019m just curious, has anything changed in terms of your expectations for efficiency improvement? I guess given the pace of revenue growth that\u2019s expected and contemplated, is there any acceleration in investments that\u2019s taking place to drive the stable to modestly efficient \u2013 improving efficiency? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Ryan, our efficiency outlook is exactly the same as it was last quarter. If you recall, actually, we guided to the \u2013 for full year 2022 for efficiency to be flat \u2013 basically kind of flat to 2021, and then modestly down for 2023 relative to 2021. What happened is that \u201822 came in a little bit lower. So, our guidance of flat to modestly down, it\u2019s the same outlook as we had before. And so, there\u2019s not big investments behind that. It\u2019s a continued journey of Capital One to lean into our opportunities to continue to invest in the tech opportunities that we see and the opportunities to create breakthroughs in the marketplace and continue to transform how we work. But pulling way up the sort of story if you kind of pull way back on operating efficiency, the journey that where we\u2019ve driven 440 basis points of improvement from 2013 \u2013 well, through 2019. And then we had the whole pandemic thing. But if I pull way up the gradual operating efficiency improvement is what we are continuing to drive for through the leveraging of our tech transformation even as we continue to invest.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: So two questions. One, just as we think about the margin and the net interest margin, interest margin outlook, \u2013 can you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about deposit betas and how that\u2019s likely to grow here over the course of the year. I noticed you talked a little bit earlier about deposit growth was really strong. Maybe give us a sense as to which types of deposits you\u2019re really leaning into at this stage. And then help us understand how asset yields are likely to trend given \u2013 forward curve, I\u2019m assuming is the base case, but tell me if you have a different point of view on that. Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Yes. Betsy, I\u2019ll start with your last question first, which is we are following the forward curve, assuming 50 bps here in the first quarter and holding flat throughout \u201823 before coming down in \u201824. With respect to how we\u2019re thinking about beta and asset yields as components of NIM, as we get into the latter part of this rate cycle, lagged deposit rates really have a bigger impact than the asset yields that reprice more quickly and did so over the last couple of quarters as the Fed was moving rapidly. And so, there\u2019s a bit of that sequential dynamic going on. In terms of thinking about overall deposit beta and product mix, roughly 85% of our deposits are in consumer. It\u2019s where our focus lies. And so if you just look at the cumulative deposit beta for the total company, it\u2019s around 35%, was low-20s last quarter. But if you look at the last increasing rate cycle, I think the terminal beta was around 41. So, I could see a terminal beta being somewhere above that, just given competitive dynamics in the marketplace at this point. So, I would say the net of all of those factors is likely to be a modest headwind to NIM. We talked last quarter about balance sheet mix \u2013 and we are largely back to a pre-pandemic balance sheet mix from where we were a year ago. And frankly, our NIM is roughly in a similar spot. So, I would say balance sheet mix over a multiple quarter period isn\u2019t likely to be a big driver, unless we just see outsized growth in the higher-margin card business. And then, the other factor that could prove to be a tailwind to potentially offset a little bit of the modest headwind that probably comes from the beta dynamics that I described is we could also see a bit of an increase in card revolve rates from where they are today. So, all of those things are \u2013 just to leave you with kind of a net impression that there are headwinds and potentially some tailwinds. But the one thing I will just note as we look ahead to the first quarter, as a reminder, in the way we calculate NIM day count has an effect. So, the one thing we know for sure is we\u2019ll have a 14 basis-point or so headwind in Q1 due to having two fewer days in the quarter.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful color. As a follow-up, I just wanted to get a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook for marketing, obviously, a critical driver of growth, and I know it\u2019s been something that you\u2019ve been very successful with in generating that top of wallet customer. But just wanted to see how we should think about that investment as we go into the next year with this NIM headwind, et cetera. Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Betsy, yes, we continue to \u2013 I feel very good about the traction that we\u2019re getting in marketing. Of course, most of the marketing that we do is in the card business. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities across the business for new account origination. We have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we\u2019re originating in. We see evidence all over the place of the benefits of our tech transformation that\u2019s giving us some extra opportunity. So, we feel very good about that. You mentioned, of course, how do we feel about leaning into this in the context of the potential looming downturn. And what we do is we just continue to look all around the edges of our originations and look for places that either we would think might be particularly likely to have a challenge or be vulnerable or things that we see having any kind of performance issues, and we sort of trim around the edges. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for three decades at Capital One, and we continue to do this. So there\u2019s a little bit of trimming around the edges. But really, the net impression I would lead you on the card side is we continue to lean in. Now, of course, there\u2019s the marketing that we do just the \u2013 to originate accounts directly through all the direct marketing media. We, of course, have our continued investments on the brand side, we \u2013 the heavy spender investments, which are particularly heavy in terms of marketing costs. We continue to get very good traction on the spender side, our growth as you sort of look at each sort of range of spenders, the \u2013 we are getting the most growth at the higher end.  So, that continues to be a good sign for us. And so, we\u2019re leaning into that. And then the other thing on the marketing side, of course, is the national bank marketing. You\u2019ve seen some of the success we\u2019re having there. Everybody in banking is sort of leaning into the deposit growth side in the context of changing interest rates, and some deposits leading the banking systems. So our marketing venues to get very good traction there. So pulling way up, we continue to feel good about the marketing. We like the traction that we\u2019re getting. And we have, of course, a very vigilant eye on the economic environment that we\u2019re moving into.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Rich, I wanted to follow up on your commentary around delinquency metrics. At the current pace of normalization, is it reasonable to expect that we could see DQs get back to pre-pandemic levels by the mid-2023 time frame? And then from there, does your outlook suggest that you expect delinquencies to flatten out, or are you conservatively expecting DQs to drift higher and are prepared for some degree of modest worsening in credit that perhaps goes a bit beyond normalization?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, what we have said, Bill, is there are lots of metrics to look at, and I can even talk to you about a few \u2013 some of the others we\u2019re looking at as well. But number one, that we would point our investors to look at is delinquency. And delinquency entries and individual delinquency flow rates have \u2013 we see the normalization happening there, as I mentioned earlier. And we think the there continues \u2013 it\u2019s interesting the \u2013 when you look at the delinquencies themselves and most of the credit metrics, they continue to just keep on moving toward what we\u2019re calling sort of normalization. Normalization, of course, is not any precise point. But there are also a number of other things that we look at that I think show sort of the strength of where this thing is headed. And one is on the vintage curves from new originations. They continue to be pretty flat month after month. They\u2019re, of course, lagged by several months, but pretty flat. And in \u2013 when we compare individual segments to where they were back in the pre-pandemic period. It\u2019s pretty much on top of each other. So, that is a good sign. We continue to look at our payment rates, which continue to be elevated. We like elevated payment rates that we\u2019ve assumed they\u2019re going to normalize part of the way down to where they were before. But of course, there\u2019s been some mix shift towards more spender within Capital One\u2019s portfolio. But payment rates continue to be strong. The percent of customers making just the minimum payment is still below pre-pandemic levels. The percent of customers making full payments is above pre-pandemic levels. Revolve rate is roughly flat relative to last year and remains below pre-pandemic.  So, these are all things that are positive indicators. But I do want to say also, again, there\u2019s been some mix change in our own portfolio with a bit of a shift toward the heavier spenders. So, many of these metrics may not fully get back to where they were pre-pandemic. But if we pull up on this, what we see is \u2013 nothing we see is surprising. It would be consistent with a consumer coming off of some of the extreme stimulus and some of the extreme pullbacks in the pandemic and returning to more normal behavior. And I think the delinquency metrics are certainly leading indicators of that trajectory.\nBill Carcache: That\u2019s very helpful, Rich. Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, separate topic. Can you give us an update on Capital One\u2019s strategy for reducing friction at checkout with different electronic consumer wallet solutions. There have been some recent press reports regarding partnerships with other digital wallet providers. It would be helpful if you could just share your latest thoughts.\nJeff Norris: Before you go, we\u2019re getting a lot of background noise, Bill. Could you go on mute?\nBill Carcache: Yes.\nRichard Fairbank: So, a phrase that I\u2019ve often used is the tip of the spear in the transformation of banking is payments, both on the consumer and the commercial side. And the reason I say this is that first of all, it\u2019s very prone to significant changes in technology, and also, it\u2019s not as heavily regulated a space as much of banking is. You don\u2019t have to be a bank holding company to be doing a lot of those things. And that\u2019s actually the area that we have seen certainly a lot of traction in \u2013 by some very successful tech company.  So, Capital One has \u2013 we continue to support the various technology players who have developed payment innovations, and we continue to develop innovations of our own. There were some news out about in the news today, in fact, about potentially a new wallet coming out. We are 1 of 7 co-owners of EWS. And we\u2019re one of the thousands of banks that use EWS. But on that one, we really don\u2019t have any specific comments to get ahead of the EWS management team on that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Rich, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your thoughts on auto credit. And then, as a follow-up, what you\u2019re seeing on credit card spend, in particular, heavy spenders and whether or not they can sustain for travel and spend numbers.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thank you, Don. In auto, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the auto business and maybe a little bit of a comparison to the card business. Just to talk about \u2013 auto as many of the very same trends. It is all the same general trends going on with the consumer and the normalization that we have been talking about. The auto business also has some other things that are unique to it. Auto recoveries, for example. Auto recoveries inventories are unusually low because of the very low charge-offs that we\u2019ve had in the past few years. The past charge-offs are basically the raw material for future recoveries. So, the generally good news that has been in the auto industry of robust used car prices actually puts upward pressure on our overall loss rate as recoveries inventory build. So, we also, in terms of the credit metrics, we have seen more degradation in the very, very low and mostly below where we play in the auto business, but we have trimmed a little bit around the edges at our own low end. But basically, we continue to feel very good about our originations. From a credit point of view, the biggest issue in auto is the margin pressure that has come from the rising interest rates that have not been fully passed through by the competition. So we continue to feel really good about the auto opportunity, but our pullback is really not a credit-driven pullback so much as it is a margin-driven pullback. But we certainly do see the \u2013 we can see the normalization in the auto business.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. And then on the credit card spend, same story. Are you seeing moderation? And can you talk about heavy spenders trends?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. We \u2013 you\u2019ll notice our own spend growth numbers moderated quite a bit this quarter. We are seeing spend per account per customer moderate across our portfolio, moderating the most at the lower end, but we see the moderation. We see it the least in the very heaviest spenders, but the moderation that you see in our spend growth metrics are driven really by what\u2019s happening per account, we continue to get nice growth of accounts. So that is a phenomenon that \u2013 and then we kind of ask, well, what should we be rooting for? I think you\u2019re seeing a very rational response by consumers to the environment. There was a big surge in spending. I think it\u2019s moderating somewhat, particularly at places other than the very highest end of the marketplace. So, I think it\u2019s basically a sign of consumers being rational.\nOperator: Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Andrew, first question for you on share repurchases. Maybe you could just help us think about the pace of share repurchases as we move forward because I know you guys slowed them down, but you\u2019ve been building capital. Maybe you can just help us with that first.\nAndrew Young: Sure, Sanjay. In terms of thinking about the capital that we have moved down over the course of the last couple of years from \u2013 in the 14 to we hit a low point of 12.1, a couple quarters ago. But as we sit here today, we\u2019re just looking at the actual and forecasted levels and the earnings and growth and in particular, economic conditions, and there\u2019s some pretty wide error bars around those factors, particularly with respect to growth and economic uncertainty. And so, we feel like at this moment in time that it\u2019s good to be a little bit more on the conservative side with risk management of managing that capital. But clearly, we have the flexibility around our capital decisions under SCBs. And so \u2013 and I don\u2019t know, Rich, if you wanted to make any comments about repurchases as well.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, we \u2013 I think we just continue to generate a lot of capital. And we \u2013 a central part of our strategy is the return of capital through share repurchases and dividends. Lately, we\u2019ve dialed back a little bit on that just really as a measure of prudence in an unusually uncertain time like this. I think there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve never met anyone who sort of says that they had too much capital in a downturn. So after very strong levels of buybacks, we\u2019ve moderated here in this environment, but the strategy of Capital One continues to be the same. And we believe that return of capital is an important part of the economic equation for investors over time.\nSanjay Sakhrani: So, should we assume sort of the fourth quarter pace as a good run rate or just not assume anything?\nAndrew Young: Yes. Sanjay, we\u2019re just going to manage it dynamically based on what we see in the marketplace and the factors that I described before. So, at this point, you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve been doing over the last handful of months, roughly $50 million a month. But again, we have flexibility, and as we have a bit more certainty of how the coming quarters will play out, that\u2019s going to inform our actions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the level of marketing growth for the year. You had a bit of a step up, I\u2019d say, in 2022 and the growth rates there are obviously showing a lot of traction in most of your metrics. Is there essentially kind of a bit of a slowdown but still have the ability to continue to grow and get into the opportunity on the card side?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Arren, yes, marketing \u2013 the marketing story has several components to it. One is just the \u2013 and an important part of that is the sort of real-time response to the opportunities that we see. And we continue \u2013 and especially talking about card and of course, card is where most of the marketing is. But, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities really across our business and are leaning into them.  So that \u2013 and it\u2019s corresponded with some expansion in opportunities that are just a byproduct of our tech transformation, and it\u2019s just more access points, more channels, more better credit models that give a little bit deeper and wider access to opportunities and more granularity. The more granularity that we get from our models, actually, the more we can separate the attractive customers from the less attractive and it allows us to lean in more. So, the marketing \u2013 the pursuit of the real-time opportunities we see is an important part of the marketing, and that is going very well. The second important driver, of course, is the continued traction we\u2019re getting in our really 10-year journey to drive more and more upmarket with focus on heavy spenders. And I think back to when we launched the Venture card in 2010. And \u2013 but of course, this journey \u2013 and we\u2019ve been declaring for years that the pursuit of the top of the market is not something that is an opportunistic one of in and out. And it is much more about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and then investing to be able to do that. And that\u2019s about great products with heavy reward content, great servicing, exceptional digital experiences but also more and more of the experiences that are consistent with the very high end lifestyle and so on. So, there have been a bunch of investments there. Most of that \u2013 not all of it, but a lot of that shows up in marketing. That also has a significant upfront component in terms of not only the direct marketing and the brand building, but also the early spend bonuses that go right through the marketing line when we \u2013 at the early stage of these accounts. So, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been growing and sustaining over the last number of years. We love the traction that we\u2019re getting. And so, we continue to lean into that. And then again, the national bank, where I just want to comment, we are really pleased with the national bank that we\u2019ve built. This is a \u2013 we are the really only kind of full service national bank that is \u2013 doesn\u2019t have a national quest to \u2013 through acquisition to continue to grow.  In other words, of all the banks our size or even smaller, the realistic path to growth is to do that through mergers and acquisitions, our path is an organic one. We\u2019ve invested quite a bit to create full digital capabilities for almost everything you can do in a branch to be able to be done by a customer digitally. And so that our growth story is not just about savings accounts, but it\u2019s very much about checking accounts as well. And this is our quest we\u2019ve been on for some number of years to build a national bank. That also is \u2013 that\u2019s physical distribution light and marketing heavy. So a bunch of things kind of come together to create the pretty big marketing levels that we have now, but we feel very good about the traction that we\u2019re getting.\nJeff Norris:\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Shane with JP Morgan.\nRichard Shane: Andrew, you\u2019ve made the comment talking about the reserve rate on the card portfolio and reflecting the seasonality of the increase in spend and balances from spend-driven accounts. As we move into Q1, should we assume that with normal portfolio runoff but a mix shift that that allowance coverage ratio will actually pick up then because you\u2019re going to get a mix shift?\nAndrew Young: Well, there\u2019s a number of factors, Rick, that will play into coverage ratio. So, why don\u2019t I just pull up and lay out the key pieces and forecast assumptions of our allowance. And I will get to your kind of seasonal balance point in a moment. But I think it\u2019s important to lay out all of the component parts rather than just talk about one individual one since all of them will affect where coverage goes from here.  So, the first part of the allowance is we\u2019re using models to estimate the next 12 months of losses. And the early period of this forecast is generally more accurate because, as Rich was talking about earlier, we can look at the existing delinquency inventories and flow rates, beyond those months we incorporate in the economic assumptions, they become a more significant driver of expected loss content. I referenced that in the answer to the first question that was asked on the call, but the error bars around the loss content widened the further we go out over the course of the year. The second factor impacting the allowances, we start from the year one exit rate for losses and then assume a reversion to a long-term average over the following 12 months. And then, the third thing is we net forecasted recoveries against the loss estimates for all of those periods. And so, on top of all of those assumptions, we then put qualitative factors in places where we believe modeled outcomes have limitations. And so, we end up putting all of those pieces together to evaluate the allowance. The open-ended product of credit card is different than closed-end loans as we go through those mechanics because with closed-end loans, we\u2019re reserving for estimated loss content for the account. But in a revolving product like card, we\u2019re only able to reserve for the loss content related to the balances that are on the books at the end of the quarter as opposed to the projected loss content for the account. So getting to your question then, when we have elevated seasonal balances in the fourth quarter, we expect a portion of those balances to pay down very quickly. And therefore, those specific balances are likely to have very, very low loss content given the life of the balance is far shorter than the life of the account.  So all else equal, the coverage ratio in the fourth quarter has a bit of natural downward pressure from that elevated denominator as you suggest. But looking ahead, there\u2019s a bunch of factors that can impact where the allowance goes from here beyond that single effect. In periods where future losses may increase we would replace the low loss content of the current quarter with the projected higher loss content in a future period. And for what it\u2019s worth, those assumptions also then carry into that reversion period. As we have growth with seasonally adjusted balances, Rich mentioned this before, CECL significantly pulls forward that allowance cost of growth. And then the third factor is coming out of a period where we have unusually low losses like we\u2019ve experienced, over the last couple of quarters, you have lower recoveries to offset the forecasted loss content. So, all of those things can put upward pressure on allowance but we can also have revisions to our economic assumptions, to delinquency flow rates, to just our overall loss content. And so, there\u2019s pressures in the other direction. And so, I appreciate your bearing with me for a long-winded complex answer, but I think we all saw the complexity and pro-cyclicality of CECL play out during the pandemic when we had to make a bunch of assumptions as the pandemic played out, we built a sizable allowance only to release virtually all of it over the subsequent quarters. And so, it\u2019s just a very difficult thing to predict given all of the assumptions at play, which is why we are trying to focus you on Mako [ph] and having delinquencies as a leading edge indicator of Mako because that is ultimately where the real economic cost is felt.\nRichard Shane: Got it. No, it\u2019s a great answer, and I\u2019m glad to bear with you. I\u2019ll probably read it in the transcript about 7 more times.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And I was hoping to talk a little bit about marketing. I mean, Rich, you did mention that you were primarily in card and primarily in the upscale customer. But could you just talk a little bit about, number one, what you might be doing kind of in nonprime and how we should think about whether that total marketing spend given what you see is likely to be higher in \u201823 or not?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So Moshe, I\u2019m glad you asked the question because I would not want the net impression to be \u2013 I think what you were saying is that, is our marketing primarily just in the upscale customer segment? Differentially relative to years ago, we\u2019ve certainly had a shift to the higher end in terms of our marketing. The marketing is also so expensive at that end. And then, also the marketing at the higher end tends to, in some sense, lift the boats across the franchise. So, the marketing at the higher end is carrying a lot on its shoulders, Moshe. But, we do a lot of marketing in the mass market of the card business, including in the higher end of the subprime segment of the market.  This is \u2013 our strategy here is \u2013 well, it changes all \u2013 we tweak it around the edges all the time. We\u2019ve been doing this for pretty much approaching three decades now, at the lower end of the market. And the marketing there is direct marketing, stimulus response, very information based. And so, the marketing machine that we\u2019ve built, which has been enhanced by technology here is definitely leaning into that opportunity. And I do want to say that the \u2013 we continue to get good traction in the subprime and prime parts of the marketplace, even as we certainly relative to 10 years ago, have a lot more marketing going on at the top of the market. So, there\u2019s quite a bit going on, and we feel good about the traction there.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Maybe just to kind of \u2013 as a follow-up, what would it take for you to see, either in the portfolio or in the market for you to do less marketing?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. The way this tends to happen is it happens in one little segment, one micro segment at the margin in response to things that we see going on there. I use this phrase a lot, trimming around the edges. And you\u2019ve heard me use that for many, many years. And this is something that we always do or something we\u2019re expanding around the edges. The net feel of these days is we\u2019re doing more trimming around the edges than expanding around the edges, but it is \u2013 so it\u2019s less about at the top of the house saying, we just believe we should do \u2013 obviously, at the top of the house, we\u2019re looking at all the macro things, but we\u2019re linking what we see in the macro level to what we\u2019re seeing right there in real time or the earliest we can see from our credit metrics. And then, using the technology we\u2019ve continued to invest so heavily in to have a more and more granular diagnosis. And at an earlier time than ever before diagnosis of where anything is deviating from the trajectory that we would expect. And then one is sort of the diagnosis of deviation. And the second thing, of course, is trying to get sort of a root cause, understanding of what may be driving that. And this is something that we continue to put a lot of energy into and it has led us to trim some \u2013 there are some things that we have seen degrade a fair amount around the edges. They\u2019re fairly small in the overall size of things, but we\u2019re certainly glad when we see them. And then, what we try to do is to link data that we see to behavior that \u2013 excuse me, to sort of an explanation of what\u2019s going on from a customer and credit dynamic to be able to be \u2013 it makes total sense. So therefore, as things play out, it\u2019s less likely \u2013 and let\u2019s say, we go more into a downturn, it\u2019s less likely on the card side that you would see a big pullback. The kind of things you\u2019d see is more trimming around the edges, more reduction of the credit lines that are given, and that would be more how it would play out.\nOperator: John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: On the \u2013 regarding the reserve build in terms of the drivers of the reserve build this quarter, I know you cited loan growth, you cited the macro backdrop, and you sited credit normalization. Is there any way to help parse out how much of the build of $1 billion is attributable to loan growth versus macro versus credit normalization?\nAndrew Young: Yes. John, we don\u2019t break out those components in part because some of them are actually related to one another. For instance, how we think about qualitative factors and how we think about our base forecast is tied into one another. And so, that\u2019s why we just wanted to lay out that quarter-over-quarter when you look at consensus estimates for things like unemployment, looking ahead at 2023, from where we were as of the end of the third quarter to where we were at the end of the fourth quarter, looking ahead on some of those metrics, we saw a degree of worsening. And when you couple that with shifting forward one quarter and replacing a much lower loss content in the fourth quarter with continued normalization, as I referenced it heading into 2023, those are factors that go into it. But actually not even really able to break out the component parts because they\u2019re tied with one another with all the assumptions.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. No, I get it. That\u2019s helpful. The normalization point, if I could just ask one more thing on that, was there anything about the normalization? And I appreciate the color you already gave. But is there anything about the normalization that you\u2019re seeing that is kind of faster than expected, or any change like that that necessitated the size of the build this quarter?\nAndrew Young: No. And I think Rich touched on some of these in one of his earlier responses, but what we\u2019re seeing in terms of normalization is playing out as we expect. It\u2019s part of why I wanted to highlight the fact that the mechanics of the reserve though only take into account that 12-month model period and revert from there. And so, we\u2019re only allowing for the content \u2013 the outstandings content at the end of the quarter as well. So, even if things play out exactly as we expect, we could see allowance build, just like we saw this quarter. It just depends on a whole host of factors.\nJeff Norris: And I think that concludes our Q&A for the evening. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here later this evening if you have any further questions. Have a good night.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I'll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Ending loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter. And revenue was up 19% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points. Noninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 6% year-over-year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. Consumer Banking revenue was up 10% year-over-year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat. Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was therefore neutral to the Company. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% year-over-year. Noninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%. In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.  Charge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. We're focusing on efficiency improvement and we're managing capital prudently. As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Yes. Thank you. Let me just start with a reminder of what we mean by growth math. As a general rule of thumb, losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and then gradually come down. When we accelerate growth and especially when those new loans are added to a seasoned back book with low losses, it can increase the overall level of losses of a portfolio. We grew rapidly \u2013 for example, just looking back at when we talk a lot about growth math, we grew rapidly in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and had a particularly visible growth math effect in the wake of that growth. At that time, the large front book was adding to a back book that was unusually seasoned because it had survived the Great Recession. Given our recent rate of growth, I think it's likely we'll see some growth math effect again over the next few years. But I think the general normalization trend will be the bigger driver of our credit trajectory. One other thing that's different about growth math going forward is CECL. Under the CECL accounting regime, the allowance impact of new growth are pulled forward significantly. We haven't seen this effect for most of the pandemic, even as we have accelerated our growth because of the offsetting favorable factors in our allowance. But as our growth continues, a portion of our allowance builds going forward are intended to support that growth. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So consumer credit metrics remain strong. And of course, as we've seen, they've been normalizing steadily through 2022 and are approaching pre-pandemic levels. At first, normalization was more pronounced in some segments more than others. It was \u2013 of course \u2013 and by the way, this is always the case that front book, new originations tend to be higher. So, that would have been shocking, had it been different. But the other thing we also said and talked to investors about it was more \u2013 normalization was happening everywhere, but it was more pronounced at the lower end of the market.  More recently, we've actually seen more uniform trend of normalization across businesses and segments, so, for example, across various FICO ranges and also across income levels. When we index them on credit metrics back to where they were before the pandemic, the sort of rest of the credit spectrum and rest of the income spectrums caught up to the, very recently in the last few months, to the lower end. So really, if I pull on that, it looks like the normalization is pretty consistent across the board. And \u2013 yes, go ahead, Ryan. So, you asked various competitors are forecasting or talking about different times at which things cross 2019 levels. I think at Capital One, we're not making specific predictions on that. But I think the key thing I would have you look at is the delinquency metrics. Delinquency metrics are the best single predictor of where things are going to go in the near term. And in fact, if we look at flow rates, we can see that very early flow rates into delinquency buckets are pretty normalized. So, we're not giving specific guidance. But we would say, look at the credit metrics, look at the dynamics across other metrics, but we feel this is \u2013 it's clearly normalizing as we see it. Yes. Ryan, our efficiency outlook is exactly the same as it was last quarter. If you recall, actually, we guided to the \u2013 for full year 2022 for efficiency to be flat \u2013 basically kind of flat to 2021, and then modestly down for 2023 relative to 2021. What happened is that \u201822 came in a little bit lower. So, our guidance of flat to modestly down, it's the same outlook as we had before. And so, there's not big investments behind that. It's a continued journey of Capital One to lean into our opportunities to continue to invest in the tech opportunities that we see and the opportunities to create breakthroughs in the marketplace and continue to transform how we work. But pulling way up the sort of story if you kind of pull way back on operating efficiency, the journey that where we've driven 440 basis points of improvement from 2013 \u2013 well, through 2019. And then we had the whole pandemic thing. But if I pull way up the gradual operating efficiency improvement is what we are continuing to drive for through the leveraging of our tech transformation even as we continue to invest. Betsy, yes, we continue to \u2013 I feel very good about the traction that we're getting in marketing. Of course, most of the marketing that we do is in the card business. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities across the business for new account origination. We have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we're originating in. We see evidence all over the place of the benefits of our tech transformation that's giving us some extra opportunity. So, we feel very good about that. You mentioned, of course, how do we feel about leaning into this in the context of the potential looming downturn. And what we do is we just continue to look all around the edges of our originations and look for places that either we would think might be particularly likely to have a challenge or be vulnerable or things that we see having any kind of performance issues, and we sort of trim around the edges. That's what we've been doing for three decades at Capital One, and we continue to do this. So there's a little bit of trimming around the edges. But really, the net impression I would lead you on the card side is we continue to lean in. Now, of course, there's the marketing that we do just the \u2013 to originate accounts directly through all the direct marketing media. We, of course, have our continued investments on the brand side, we \u2013 the heavy spender investments, which are particularly heavy in terms of marketing costs. We continue to get very good traction on the spender side, our growth as you sort of look at each sort of range of spenders, the \u2013 we are getting the most growth at the higher end.  So, that continues to be a good sign for us. And so, we're leaning into that. And then the other thing on the marketing side, of course, is the national bank marketing. You've seen some of the success we're having there. Everybody in banking is sort of leaning into the deposit growth side in the context of changing interest rates, and some deposits leading the banking systems. So our marketing venues to get very good traction there. So pulling way up, we continue to feel good about the marketing. We like the traction that we're getting. And we have, of course, a very vigilant eye on the economic environment that we're moving into. Well, what we have said, Bill, is there are lots of metrics to look at, and I can even talk to you about a few \u2013 some of the others we're looking at as well. But number one, that we would point our investors to look at is delinquency. And delinquency entries and individual delinquency flow rates have \u2013 we see the normalization happening there, as I mentioned earlier. And we think the there continues \u2013 it's interesting the \u2013 when you look at the delinquencies themselves and most of the credit metrics, they continue to just keep on moving toward what we're calling sort of normalization. Normalization, of course, is not any precise point. But there are also a number of other things that we look at that I think show sort of the strength of where this thing is headed. And one is on the vintage curves from new originations. They continue to be pretty flat month after month. They're, of course, lagged by several months, but pretty flat. And in \u2013 when we compare individual segments to where they were back in the pre-pandemic period. It's pretty much on top of each other. So, that is a good sign. We continue to look at our payment rates, which continue to be elevated. We like elevated payment rates that we've assumed they're going to normalize part of the way down to where they were before. But of course, there's been some mix shift towards more spender within Capital One's portfolio. But payment rates continue to be strong. The percent of customers making just the minimum payment is still below pre-pandemic levels. The percent of customers making full payments is above pre-pandemic levels. Revolve rate is roughly flat relative to last year and remains below pre-pandemic.  So, these are all things that are positive indicators. But I do want to say also, again, there's been some mix change in our own portfolio with a bit of a shift toward the heavier spenders. So, many of these metrics may not fully get back to where they were pre-pandemic. But if we pull up on this, what we see is \u2013 nothing we see is surprising. It would be consistent with a consumer coming off of some of the extreme stimulus and some of the extreme pullbacks in the pandemic and returning to more normal behavior. And I think the delinquency metrics are certainly leading indicators of that trajectory. So, a phrase that I've often used is the tip of the spear in the transformation of banking is payments, both on the consumer and the commercial side. And the reason I say this is that first of all, it's very prone to significant changes in technology, and also, it's not as heavily regulated a space as much of banking is. You don't have to be a bank holding company to be doing a lot of those things. And that's actually the area that we have seen certainly a lot of traction in \u2013 by some very successful tech company.  So, Capital One has \u2013 we continue to support the various technology players who have developed payment innovations, and we continue to develop innovations of our own. There were some news out about in the news today, in fact, about potentially a new wallet coming out. We are 1 of 7 co-owners of EWS. And we're one of the thousands of banks that use EWS. But on that one, we really don't have any specific comments to get ahead of the EWS management team on that. Okay. Thank you, Don. In auto, let's talk a little bit about the auto business and maybe a little bit of a comparison to the card business. Just to talk about \u2013 auto as many of the very same trends. It is all the same general trends going on with the consumer and the normalization that we have been talking about. The auto business also has some other things that are unique to it. Auto recoveries, for example. Auto recoveries inventories are unusually low because of the very low charge-offs that we've had in the past few years. The past charge-offs are basically the raw material for future recoveries. So, the generally good news that has been in the auto industry of robust used car prices actually puts upward pressure on our overall loss rate as recoveries inventory build. So, we also, in terms of the credit metrics, we have seen more degradation in the very, very low and mostly below where we play in the auto business, but we have trimmed a little bit around the edges at our own low end. But basically, we continue to feel very good about our originations. From a credit point of view, the biggest issue in auto is the margin pressure that has come from the rising interest rates that have not been fully passed through by the competition. So we continue to feel really good about the auto opportunity, but our pullback is really not a credit-driven pullback so much as it is a margin-driven pullback. But we certainly do see the \u2013 we can see the normalization in the auto business. Yes. We \u2013 you'll notice our own spend growth numbers moderated quite a bit this quarter. We are seeing spend per account per customer moderate across our portfolio, moderating the most at the lower end, but we see the moderation. We see it the least in the very heaviest spenders, but the moderation that you see in our spend growth metrics are driven really by what's happening per account, we continue to get nice growth of accounts. So that is a phenomenon that \u2013 and then we kind of ask, well, what should we be rooting for? I think you're seeing a very rational response by consumers to the environment. There was a big surge in spending. I think it's moderating somewhat, particularly at places other than the very highest end of the marketplace. So, I think it's basically a sign of consumers being rational. Yes. Well, we \u2013 I think we just continue to generate a lot of capital. And we \u2013 a central part of our strategy is the return of capital through share repurchases and dividends. Lately, we've dialed back a little bit on that just really as a measure of prudence in an unusually uncertain time like this. I think there's \u2013 I've never met anyone who sort of says that they had too much capital in a downturn. So after very strong levels of buybacks, we've moderated here in this environment, but the strategy of Capital One continues to be the same. And we believe that return of capital is an important part of the economic equation for investors over time. Yes. Arren, yes, marketing \u2013 the marketing story has several components to it. One is just the \u2013 and an important part of that is the sort of real-time response to the opportunities that we see. And we continue \u2013 and especially talking about card and of course, card is where most of the marketing is. But, we continue to see attractive growth opportunities really across our business and are leaning into them.  So that \u2013 and it's corresponded with some expansion in opportunities that are just a byproduct of our tech transformation, and it's just more access points, more channels, more better credit models that give a little bit deeper and wider access to opportunities and more granularity. The more granularity that we get from our models, actually, the more we can separate the attractive customers from the less attractive and it allows us to lean in more. So, the marketing \u2013 the pursuit of the real-time opportunities we see is an important part of the marketing, and that is going very well. The second important driver, of course, is the continued traction we're getting in our really 10-year journey to drive more and more upmarket with focus on heavy spenders. And I think back to when we launched the Venture card in 2010. And \u2013 but of course, this journey \u2013 and we've been declaring for years that the pursuit of the top of the market is not something that is an opportunistic one of in and out. And it is much more about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and then investing to be able to do that. And that's about great products with heavy reward content, great servicing, exceptional digital experiences but also more and more of the experiences that are consistent with the very high end lifestyle and so on. So, there have been a bunch of investments there. Most of that \u2013 not all of it, but a lot of that shows up in marketing. That also has a significant upfront component in terms of not only the direct marketing and the brand building, but also the early spend bonuses that go right through the marketing line when we \u2013 at the early stage of these accounts. So, that's something that we've been growing and sustaining over the last number of years. We love the traction that we're getting. And so, we continue to lean into that. And then again, the national bank, where I just want to comment, we are really pleased with the national bank that we've built. This is a \u2013 we are the really only kind of full service national bank that is \u2013 doesn't have a national quest to \u2013 through acquisition to continue to grow.  In other words, of all the banks our size or even smaller, the realistic path to growth is to do that through mergers and acquisitions, our path is an organic one. We've invested quite a bit to create full digital capabilities for almost everything you can do in a branch to be able to be done by a customer digitally. And so that our growth story is not just about savings accounts, but it's very much about checking accounts as well. And this is our quest we've been on for some number of years to build a national bank. That also is \u2013 that's physical distribution light and marketing heavy. So a bunch of things kind of come together to create the pretty big marketing levels that we have now, but we feel very good about the traction that we're getting. Yes. So Moshe, I'm glad you asked the question because I would not want the net impression to be \u2013 I think what you were saying is that, is our marketing primarily just in the upscale customer segment? Differentially relative to years ago, we've certainly had a shift to the higher end in terms of our marketing. The marketing is also so expensive at that end. And then, also the marketing at the higher end tends to, in some sense, lift the boats across the franchise. So, the marketing at the higher end is carrying a lot on its shoulders, Moshe. But, we do a lot of marketing in the mass market of the card business, including in the higher end of the subprime segment of the market.  This is \u2013 our strategy here is \u2013 well, it changes all \u2013 we tweak it around the edges all the time. We've been doing this for pretty much approaching three decades now, at the lower end of the market. And the marketing there is direct marketing, stimulus response, very information based. And so, the marketing machine that we've built, which has been enhanced by technology here is definitely leaning into that opportunity. And I do want to say that the \u2013 we continue to get good traction in the subprime and prime parts of the marketplace, even as we certainly relative to 10 years ago, have a lot more marketing going on at the top of the market. So, there's quite a bit going on, and we feel good about the traction there. Yes. The way this tends to happen is it happens in one little segment, one micro segment at the margin in response to things that we see going on there. I use this phrase a lot, trimming around the edges. And you've heard me use that for many, many years. And this is something that we always do or something we're expanding around the edges. The net feel of these days is we're doing more trimming around the edges than expanding around the edges, but it is \u2013 so it's less about at the top of the house saying, we just believe we should do \u2013 obviously, at the top of the house, we're looking at all the macro things, but we're linking what we see in the macro level to what we're seeing right there in real time or the earliest we can see from our credit metrics. And then, using the technology we've continued to invest so heavily in to have a more and more granular diagnosis. And at an earlier time than ever before diagnosis of where anything is deviating from the trajectory that we would expect. And then one is sort of the diagnosis of deviation. And the second thing, of course, is trying to get sort of a root cause, understanding of what may be driving that. And this is something that we continue to put a lot of energy into and it has led us to trim some \u2013 there are some things that we have seen degrade a fair amount around the edges. They're fairly small in the overall size of things, but we're certainly glad when we see them. And then, what we try to do is to link data that we see to behavior that \u2013 excuse me, to sort of an explanation of what's going on from a customer and credit dynamic to be able to be \u2013 it makes total sense. So therefore, as things play out, it's less likely \u2013 and let's say, we go more into a downturn, it's less likely on the card side that you would see a big pullback. The kind of things you'd see is more trimming around the edges, more reduction of the credit lines that are given, and that would be more how it would play out. Thank you."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items, which collectively benefited pretax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings performance share were $17.71. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our domestic car business. This loan growth coupled with net interest margin expansion drove revenue up 3% on a linked quarter basis. Noninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter \u2013 provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion. Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%. I'll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%. Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter. The impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis-point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates. The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. And finally, in our Commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis-point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio. Turning to page 6, I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion. Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings. Turning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The 4 basis-point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards car loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure Mihir. As I said in the past, we are largely consumers of economic assumptions. In this particular case for unemployment, we are assuming something that's a little modestly higher than consensus estimates for where we will land in the fourth quarter. I think consensus is somewhere around 4.8. We're \u2013 our baseline forecast gets up to around 5% in the fourth quarter. But it's important to note there's a lot of other things that go into the calculation of the reserve, things like unemployment \u2013 sorry, changes in the unemployment rate, inflation, home prices, wages, all of those factors matter as well, but our unemployment assumption is to be around 4% in the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, around 5% in the fourth quarter. Yes. Betsy, I'll start with your last question first, which is we are following the forward curve, assuming 50 bps here in the first quarter and holding flat throughout \u201823 before coming down in \u201824. With respect to how we're thinking about beta and asset yields as components of NIM, as we get into the latter part of this rate cycle, lagged deposit rates really have a bigger impact than the asset yields that reprice more quickly and did so over the last couple of quarters as the Fed was moving rapidly. And so, there's a bit of that sequential dynamic going on. In terms of thinking about overall deposit beta and product mix, roughly 85% of our deposits are in consumer. It's where our focus lies. And so if you just look at the cumulative deposit beta for the total company, it's around 35%, was low-20s last quarter. But if you look at the last increasing rate cycle, I think the terminal beta was around 41. So, I could see a terminal beta being somewhere above that, just given competitive dynamics in the marketplace at this point. So, I would say the net of all of those factors is likely to be a modest headwind to NIM. We talked last quarter about balance sheet mix \u2013 and we are largely back to a pre-pandemic balance sheet mix from where we were a year ago. And frankly, our NIM is roughly in a similar spot. So, I would say balance sheet mix over a multiple quarter period isn't likely to be a big driver, unless we just see outsized growth in the higher-margin card business. And then, the other factor that could prove to be a tailwind to potentially offset a little bit of the modest headwind that probably comes from the beta dynamics that I described is we could also see a bit of an increase in card revolve rates from where they are today. So, all of those things are \u2013 just to leave you with kind of a net impression that there are headwinds and potentially some tailwinds. But the one thing I will just note as we look ahead to the first quarter, as a reminder, in the way we calculate NIM day count has an effect. So, the one thing we know for sure is we'll have a 14 basis-point or so headwind in Q1 due to having two fewer days in the quarter. Sure, Sanjay. In terms of thinking about the capital that we have moved down over the course of the last couple of years from \u2013 in the 14 to we hit a low point of 12.1, a couple quarters ago. But as we sit here today, we're just looking at the actual and forecasted levels and the earnings and growth and in particular, economic conditions, and there's some pretty wide error bars around those factors, particularly with respect to growth and economic uncertainty. And so, we feel like at this moment in time that it's good to be a little bit more on the conservative side with risk management of managing that capital. But clearly, we have the flexibility around our capital decisions under SCBs. And so \u2013 and I don't know, Rich, if you wanted to make any comments about repurchases as well. Yes. Sanjay, we're just going to manage it dynamically based on what we see in the marketplace and the factors that I described before. So, at this point, you've seen what we've been doing over the last handful of months, roughly $50 million a month. But again, we have flexibility, and as we have a bit more certainty of how the coming quarters will play out, that's going to inform our actions. Well, there's a number of factors, Rick, that will play into coverage ratio. So, why don't I just pull up and lay out the key pieces and forecast assumptions of our allowance. And I will get to your kind of seasonal balance point in a moment. But I think it's important to lay out all of the component parts rather than just talk about one individual one since all of them will affect where coverage goes from here.  So, the first part of the allowance is we're using models to estimate the next 12 months of losses. And the early period of this forecast is generally more accurate because, as Rich was talking about earlier, we can look at the existing delinquency inventories and flow rates, beyond those months we incorporate in the economic assumptions, they become a more significant driver of expected loss content. I referenced that in the answer to the first question that was asked on the call, but the error bars around the loss content widened the further we go out over the course of the year. The second factor impacting the allowances, we start from the year one exit rate for losses and then assume a reversion to a long-term average over the following 12 months. And then, the third thing is we net forecasted recoveries against the loss estimates for all of those periods. And so, on top of all of those assumptions, we then put qualitative factors in places where we believe modeled outcomes have limitations. And so, we end up putting all of those pieces together to evaluate the allowance. The open-ended product of credit card is different than closed-end loans as we go through those mechanics because with closed-end loans, we're reserving for estimated loss content for the account. But in a revolving product like card, we're only able to reserve for the loss content related to the balances that are on the books at the end of the quarter as opposed to the projected loss content for the account. So getting to your question then, when we have elevated seasonal balances in the fourth quarter, we expect a portion of those balances to pay down very quickly. And therefore, those specific balances are likely to have very, very low loss content given the life of the balance is far shorter than the life of the account.  So all else equal, the coverage ratio in the fourth quarter has a bit of natural downward pressure from that elevated denominator as you suggest. But looking ahead, there's a bunch of factors that can impact where the allowance goes from here beyond that single effect. In periods where future losses may increase we would replace the low loss content of the current quarter with the projected higher loss content in a future period. And for what it's worth, those assumptions also then carry into that reversion period. As we have growth with seasonally adjusted balances, Rich mentioned this before, CECL significantly pulls forward that allowance cost of growth. And then the third factor is coming out of a period where we have unusually low losses like we've experienced, over the last couple of quarters, you have lower recoveries to offset the forecasted loss content. So, all of those things can put upward pressure on allowance but we can also have revisions to our economic assumptions, to delinquency flow rates, to just our overall loss content. And so, there's pressures in the other direction. And so, I appreciate your bearing with me for a long-winded complex answer, but I think we all saw the complexity and pro-cyclicality of CECL play out during the pandemic when we had to make a bunch of assumptions as the pandemic played out, we built a sizable allowance only to release virtually all of it over the subsequent quarters. And so, it's just a very difficult thing to predict given all of the assumptions at play, which is why we are trying to focus you on Mako [ph] and having delinquencies as a leading edge indicator of Mako because that is ultimately where the real economic cost is felt. Yes. John, we don't break out those components in part because some of them are actually related to one another. For instance, how we think about qualitative factors and how we think about our base forecast is tied into one another. And so, that's why we just wanted to lay out that quarter-over-quarter when you look at consensus estimates for things like unemployment, looking ahead at 2023, from where we were as of the end of the third quarter to where we were at the end of the fourth quarter, looking ahead on some of those metrics, we saw a degree of worsening. And when you couple that with shifting forward one quarter and replacing a much lower loss content in the fourth quarter with continued normalization, as I referenced it heading into 2023, those are factors that go into it. But actually not even really able to break out the component parts because they're tied with one another with all the assumptions. No. And I think Rich touched on some of these in one of his earlier responses, but what we're seeing in terms of normalization is playing out as we expect. It's part of why I wanted to highlight the fact that the mechanics of the reserve though only take into account that 12-month model period and revert from there. And so, we're only allowing for the content \u2013 the outstandings content at the end of the quarter as well. So, even if things play out exactly as we expect, we could see allowance build, just like we saw this quarter. It just depends on a whole host of factors."

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3 of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.7 billion or $4.20 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 5%, largely driven by growth across our Domestic Card and Commercial businesses. In the linked quarter, revenue increased 7%, largely driven by growth in net interest income. The loan growth I just described and NIM expansion, both contributed to the increase in net interest income. I will touch on the NIM more in a moment. Non-interest expense grew 8% in the quarter, driven by an increase in operating expenses. Higher headcount and the associated compensation costs were the single biggest driver of the linked quarter increase. In addition to compensation expenses, the collective impact of a number of smaller items also drove up Q3 expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.7 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $931 million and a $734 million allowance build. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company\u2019s $734 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to $12.2 billion as of September 30. Our total company coverage ratio increased 14 basis points to 4.02%. Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019ll discuss the allowance and coverage across each of our business segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio increased modestly in each of our segments. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased $530 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.9%. The $6 billion of loan growth in the quarter drove the majority of the allowance build. The impact of continued normalization and a modestly worse corporate economic outlook were partially offset by the release of a portion of our qualitative factors linked to uncertainty in the economy. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $61 million, driving a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 2.6%. The modestly worse corporate economic outlook I just mentioned and expectations of credit normalization drove the allowance builds. And finally, the allowance increased by $107 million in our Commercial business resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.45%. A combination of the modestly worsening corporate economic outlook, an uptick in criticized loans and loan growth drove the allowance build. Turning to Page 6, I\u2019ll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves were roughly flat at about $93 billion as our liquidity reserves have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Our securities portfolio declined by about $8 billion, driven by a combination of the decline in market value from rising rates and the continued planned runoff of the outsized portfolio we built during the pandemic. The decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily offset by higher cash and cash equivalents. Turning to Page 7. I\u2019ll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $7 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from last quarter. Our net interest margin was 6.8% in the third quarter, 45 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 26 basis points higher than last quarter. The 26 basis points linked quarter increase in NIM was driven roughly equally by three factors: first, an extra day to recognize income in the quarter; second, a continued balance sheet shift towards card away from lower-yielding assets; and third, the net benefit of the higher yield of assets relative to higher funding costs. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our preliminary common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% at the end of the third quarter, up about 10 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.7 billion of net income in the quarter was mostly offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and a little over $300 million in share repurchases. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10 with third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 16% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $22 billion or about 22% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate are well below pre-pandemic levels and continue to normalize. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.2%, up 84 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.97%, 104 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 6 basis points. The delinquency rate was up 62 basis points from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the third quarter of 2021, including an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $978 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We\u2019re seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders continued in the third quarter. Heavy spender marketing includes early spend bonuses driven by continued strong account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. In the third quarter, our marketing continued to drive strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with both new and existing customers. Our decade-long quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing. But the sustained revenue, credit, resilience, and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they\u2019re growing. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, we continued to pull back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. Many auto lenders appear to have reflected rising interest rates in their marginal pricing decisions, but others have not, and they have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 28% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in originations, Consumer Banking loan growth is slower than previous quarters. Third quarter ending loans grew 5% to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. Third quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking deposits were flat compared to the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 7% year-over-year as growth in auto loans was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins and the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. Non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and the increased marketing for our digital national bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the third quarter was 1.05%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.85%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 44 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% from the sequential quarter, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 7% in the quarter. Ending deposits were up 6% from the second quarter. Average deposits were down 2% in the quarter. Third quarter revenue was up 12% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 12%. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the third quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.97%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.57%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the third quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we pulled back on auto originations, and our Commercial Banking business posted another growth \u2013 another quarter of strong revenue growth. Credit results remain strong across our businesses. Charge-off rates and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels and credit continues to normalize. We typically see an increase in operating expense over the second half of the year \u2013 of any year. This year, the timing of some of our investment opportunities drove a larger than usual third quarter increase in operating expense, which was up 11% from the second quarter. We expect that this year\u2019s linked quarter increase in fourth quarter operating expense will be smaller than the approximately 7% linked quarter increase we\u2019ve seen on average over the last five years. Turning to operating efficiency ratio. Relative to full year 2021, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat in 2022 and modestly down in 2023. As usual, our operating expense and efficiency expectations exclude any potential adjusting items. Pulling way up, we\u2019re in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value as modern digital technology continues to transform banking. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our digital transformation. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we\u2019re continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. And we\u2019re managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a position to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts, you may wish to ask a question. Please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have additional follow-up questions, after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Liz, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nKevin Barker: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the comments around credit and how we\u2019re still in a normalization, back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some key asset classes. But at what point do you say that the year-over-year growth rate and delinquency rates is too fast relative to what you would expect for a typical normalization?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Kevin, so thank you for your question. Let me just pull up and just comment on normalization. First of all, the context of where we are because consumer credit remain strong, as you can see from the metrics. And our Domestic Card losses in the third quarter were about half of pre-pandemic levels. And our delinquencies are \u2013 and we\u2019ve often said this, unmistakably normalizing. But right now, they remain about 20% below pre-pandemic level. There is not a certain point where we \u2013 we don\u2019t look out there and say if the rate of growth of delinquencies exceeds a certain number, then we will pull back. But let me comment, first of all, that we\u2019ve said for a long time, Kevin, and I know you know this that normalization is bound to happen. It would be shocking if it didn\u2019t happen. And we\u2019ve been talking for a bunch of quarters now saying it started you needed a magnifying glass to see it and we talked about that. And now, of course, you can see it in the numbers, and it\u2019s definitely normalizing. What \u2013 the rate at which it\u2019s normalizing is, frankly, more gradual than we generally expected, but we didn\u2019t really have a road map to know exactly what pace it would normalize, we just believe so strongly that it would. So what we do with \u2013 rather than say there\u2019s a certain number that would lead us to make a certain decision, we, of course, look at this with what\u2019s happening with every segment and micro segment of our business and how it\u2019s performing. We look for starters at the back book, and that is normalizing as \u2013 well, frankly, like everything here, more gradually than expected, but still the back book is clearly normalizing as well. We then look for other patterns of normalization. And here are some of the patterns that we see, Kevin. It\u2019s more pronounced in the front book of new originations than in the existing back book. And by the way, it would be \u2013 that would be shocking if it weren\u2019t the case because 100% of the time in our history, front books normalize faster during periods of change. And we \u2013 so that \u2013 but we confirm again that front books are normalizing faster. It also seems that normalization is more pronounced at the lower end of the market. And of course, those are the populations that improve more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. Lower income consumers may also be feeling more pressure from inflation. So these trends shouldn\u2019t be surprising. But at the \u2013 at kind of a high level, what we see is very normal and is \u2013 and basically, the way we\u2019re leaning into the marketplace is very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying for a bunch of quarters now. But what we do at the micro level, at the segment level and the sub-segment level is look at the various metrics, both on the back book and on the front book to see what the patterns are, and we\u2019re comfortable with what we see in terms of front book vintage curves as a general point and across a vast majority of all the segments that we operate in. We have \u2013 around the edges, we\u2019ve done a little bit of dialing back in particular pockets where metrics are normalizing a little bit faster. We also sort of pull up and say, what are the kinds of \u2013 what are the risks that we would expect to see at a time like this with orthogonal looks through our book. And we brainstorm on what all the risk we could see, we go hunt for them. And in a couple of places, we have seen effects that caused a little bit of trimming around the edges, but the collective amount of trimming in the card business is pretty small relative to the overall scale of our growth. As you know, the \u2013 in the auto business, we have pulled back. At the very same time, we\u2019re leaning into the card business, we\u2019re pulling back in the auto business, but maybe I\u2019ll save that for another question.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I mean, is there anything \u2013 I appreciate all \u2013 the look at the granular side of the business and what you see within your book on a very micro level. But from a macro level, is there anything that you\u2019d look at that would make you pulled back that may not be apparent at the micro level? In particular, I think you made some prepared remarks about changes in the corporate outlook in particular. Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Sorry, the changes in the corporate \u2013 can you repeat that last part, changes in corporate outlook.\nKevin Barker: I believe in your prepared remarks, you said there were changes in the corporate outlook that may have affected part of your allowance. Was there anything in particular that stood out that may cause you to pull back when you think about the macroeconomic outlook?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, the \u2013 we, of course, at the whole time, we\u2019re doing the micro examination of one segment at a time. We are looking at the macro trends. It\u2019s really striking the level of inflation. And as I\u2019ve often said, we collectively, everybody on this call, none of us \u2013 and \u2013 nobody across the business world has really lived something like this since the early \u201880s. So we\u2019re especially looking for effects that might be different this time, Kevin, with respect to inflation and the \u2013 how that can play out. But \u2013 so we\u2019re always on the lookout, but the net impression, I would want to leave here is very much the same impression that I\u2019ve left with you the last many quarters here.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening everyone.\nRichard Fairbank: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So maybe just to start on the cost and efficiency side, Rich. So it\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019ll be back on the efficiency improvement journey next year. So I guess, just a two-part question. You talked about OpEx ramping less in the fourth quarter. But just given the level of marketing spend and how the spend has shifted under the hood in terms of moving up market, should we expect to see less than historical seasonality on the marketing side? And then second, just \u2013 can you help us with the magnitude of the efficiency improvement into next year? And what is actually driving the improvement? Is it pulling back on hiring or something else? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re here to declare a \u2013 I want to make a comment about marketing seasonality. It\u2019s not as \u2013 that\u2019s not as much of a physics kind of thing as certain things like credit and delinquency seasonality with consumers. I think \u2013 so I\u2019m not here to declare changes in the pattern of seasonality and marketing. The big driver of our marketing is the opportunities that we see as well as the investment in building businesses like our heavy spender business and our national bank. With respect to the drivers of operating efficiency improvement, just kind of pulling up on the journey that you mentioned. We\u2019ve been focused about this and talking with investors about operating efficiency for years. And we\u2019ve achieved a 440 basis point improvement from 2013 through 2021 even as we have invested in a comprehensive transformation of our technology over that same period of time. And we know that investing in technology modernization and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. Technology investment helps our revenue growth and helps drive productivity improvements. And beneath the surface of the high level of investment has been significant productivity gains from modernizing our tech stack, eliminating legacy vendor costs, driving customers to digital and driving more automation in the company. And at the same time, of course, we have continued to lean into this technology journey and the opportunities that it generates. And the \u2013 so it\u2019s a very shared path. And I think that our guidance for modest improvement in 2023 is a reflection of continued traction in growth and operating productivity while also continuing to invest in future opportunities.\nRyan Nash: Got it. I guess, as a follow-up question, maybe one for Andrew. Andrew, you laid out the details of some of the drivers as it pertains to the net interest margin. I fully understand that there\u2019s a seasonal component to it in 3Q. But can you maybe just talk about the positioning of the balance sheet from a rate perspective? Do you think that you can continue to see the margin drift higher? And maybe just talk about of the drivers as you look out over the course of the next couple of quarters during the rising rate cycle? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Sure, Ryan. Recall, it\u2019s probably helpful to start with a little bit of history here. And you\u2019ll recall, our NIM was compressed during the pandemic, largely driven by a balance sheet that was skewed much more towards cash and securities than card loans. And as we progressed over the course of the pandemic, you saw that begin to normalize. And so just by way of evidence, a year ago, our NIM was, I think, 6.35%. I had said in my prepared remarks. And at that point, card was closer to 27%. I think of our interest-earning assets and cash and securities was something like 33%. Cards now shifted to be just over 30% and cash and securities are down to 27%. So I share that to say we\u2019re now operating much closer to our pre-pandemic balance sheet mix. And our NIM is roughly in a similar spot to where it was before the pandemic. So to your question then about rate risk, you can see in our Q, our rate risk disclosures, we\u2019re really only slightly asset sensitive at this point. And keep in mind that\u2019s relative to forwards. So the 150 basis point projected moves over the next couple of months are already sort of embedded in that neutral baseline. And so as I think about the future, there\u2019s a number of things that can impact NIM, not to mention seasonality, but the credit impacts on revenue, competitive pressure on loan margins and deposit pricing. But as we sit here today, I think a lot of the things that we pointed to in the past in terms of balance sheet mix at least have largely run their course. So hopefully, this gives you some sense of the primary forces that play with NIM.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good evening.\nRichard Fairbank: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Just to follow-up on that for the follow-up question. So now that you\u2019re back to the pre-pandemic mix of liquidity and loans, how should we think about where the balance sheet projects from here in terms of funding mix and funding stack? And maybe you could speak a little bit to your thoughts on the buyback because I noticed this quarter, it was down a bit, $313 million, down a bit from the prior two quarters, which averaged about $2 billion. So if you could help us understand how you\u2019re going to be funding the loan growth and what kind of mix we should be expecting? Should liquidity go down even more than what it was pre-pandemic? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Okay. I\u2019ll take, I think, what I heard is the first two questions there, Betsy, in NIM and funding, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich to talk about buyback. So on the NIM side and the asset portion of that, I just want to clarify what will drive it from here. I do think if you look back historically, cash and securities were roughly 25% of our balance sheet. We\u2019re a little bit above that. But given our needs for liquidity and how we use the investment portfolio, I would think that something in that 25% range of the size of the balance sheet is a reasonable assumption for that. Then on the loan side, it really becomes a matter of just marketplace dynamics, what we see as opportunities for growth. And so whether card is growing more quickly than, say, auto or commercial, its percentage of the rest of the balance sheet could drift up. But I don\u2019t want to give any indication of how we think that\u2019s playing out, and there\u2019s certainly not a target that we have in terms of the asset side of the balance sheet. On the funding side, we aim to have a diversified mix of funding that\u2019s largely skewed to retail deposits, which, again, historically has been something, I think, around 70% of our overall funding, and we have commercial deposits and brokered CDs and then securitization and wholesale funding \u2013 other sources of wholesale funding. And so again, I would say if you look back to pre-pandemic levels over history compared to where we are today, we\u2019re kind of back in a relatively similar place there. So I think I heard in your question, not just mix, but how do we fund growth from here in making marginal decisions for funding incremental loan growth. We\u2019re going to weigh a variety of factors, our customers\u2019 appetite for different deposit products and our ability to build customer relationships with them, the economics of different funding instruments, the duration of funding or liquidity needs. So we\u2019re going to throw all of that into our decision-making process to figure out how to fund. But I also think it\u2019s important to think about those funding choices at the margin. It\u2019s not just about the liability side. We also have asset growth choices at the margin, too. So we\u2019re just going to look at the total integrated economics of both sides of the balance sheet to make those choices. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich to talk about buybacks.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew. Betsy, we \u2013 so with the question with respect to why did you slow down your share repurchase pace this quarter. So we repurchased roughly $300 million of shares during the third quarter. About 1.5 years ago, we had a CET1 in the high 14s. Since then, we\u2019ve been repurchasing shares and our CET1 ratio has come down into the low 12s. And the pace of our repurchases is, of course, driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, of course, growth, economic conditions, market dynamics. And at this point, there remains some pretty sizable error bars around some of these factors, particularly growth and economic uncertainty. And so it\u2019s not lost on us at times like this. It\u2019s prudent risk management to be conservative with our capital actions. And this is a very dynamic process. And under the new SCB rules, we\u2019re able to maintain flexibility in our capital decisions.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Rich, you mentioned you\u2019re keeping an eye on your competitors. I\u2019m just wondering if you could just drill down a little bit on that given you\u2019ve had a lot of fintechs in the space growing. And obviously, it\u2019s a very unpredictable next 12 months to 18 months. So maybe you could just talk about domestic card and auto as well because you mentioned a number of different variables there? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Well, Sanjay, did you want me to talk about competition in those spaces? Or is it a competition-driven question?\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess, competition, but also how it might have an impact on credit as we look forward because you\u2019ve had some new players underwriting as well.\nRichard Fairbank: Right. So, let\u2019s talk about competition in the card business, and then I\u2019ll talk about it in the auto business. But generally, in the card business, competition continues to be high, but largely stable and rational over the past few quarters. Now here, I\u2019m really talking about the major \u2013 the banking industry, the classic competitive set within the card business. But we certainly have seen marketing levels that have returned to really beyond pre-pandemic levels. So, we certainly have an eye on that. On the rewards competition side, there\u2019s \u2013 here or there, there are new things that people come out with, but there\u2019s generally a stability in that space on APRs in the card business have generally \u2013 the issuers have generally adjusted headline rates along with the change in the prime rate. So there\u2019s a kind of a stability in the margins there. And so again, we see a pretty stable competitive environment in the major \u2013 among major card players. A thing that we\u2019ve mentioned a number of times is concerned about the fintechs and their impact on a business like the card business, less so by the fintechs actually running around issuing credit cards, but more by the impact from other credit products like installment loans, buy-now-pay-later loans and others that can affect the portfolio of borrowing that our customers, current and prospective customers might have. So, we were pretty concerned and we\u2019ve talked about it a number of times about the rapidly growing extent of fintech credit extension compounded by the fact no one could measure the size of it, because many of these folks like many of the buy-now-pay-later players, for example, not reporting to the credit bureaus. The other thing that caught our eye, of course, all along the way here is, virtually every fintech that enters lending, enters in the lower side of the market. There\u2019s virtually no one that enters right at the heaviest vendor side of the market. They just don\u2019t have the scale for those thin-margin businesses. And so the fintech accesses to the extent that they\u2019re there were logically and inferentially from what we see would be more in the lower end of the market, and that, of course, is something we watch pretty carefully to the best extent that we can see it. Now the one thing that, that just intuitively is a helpful thing to the cause here is that fintechs have generally struggled. They seem to have dialed back quite a bit. So there may be less pressure in that particular space. But another thing to keep our eye out for here is it\u2019s not just the amount of volume of marketing or the intensity of competition is the underwriting choices that folks make. Another thing that, Sanjay, that we have had our eye on is basically FICO drift. And you can absolutely see out there the reduction in the size of the subprime population. Now we can all ask ourselves is that really just great news that the size of subprime America has declined or how much is that a shorter-term impact from all the stimulus, the forbearance, the spending pullbacks and things that happened during the pandemic. So, we ourselves do our best to try to normalize for those effects in our underwriting. And so where I would [Audio Gap] to say, I think the competitive risks that exist and that we have seen out there are more in the lower end of the marketplace even with credit cards themselves. If you look at the data, there has been the highest \u2013 there\u2019s been more growth in the lower end of the market in terms of just credit card customers than anywhere else. So all of this is something we\u2019re watching incredibly carefully. And to the earlier question that was asked about how do we do underwriting, we, of course, do everything we can to look at every segment and the \u2013 to look for any changes that we\u2019re seeing ultimately in our own performance. We\u2019ve trimmed around the edges in a few places. But overall, so far, it looks pretty good, but partly how we do this. We don\u2019t just run around and just let the numbers do the talking. We do a combination of using actually machine learning monitoring-based methodologies to look for early signs of things being off of expectation within our portfolio. And then at the same time, broad strategic logic on what would you expect to happen from this competitive environment, from this credit environment, from this inflationary environment. So that\u2019s a window into that side of the business. On the auto side of the business, the competition, I don\u2019t \u2013 our issue with the competition is really not an underwriting issue at this point. The general risks that we talked about just a couple of minutes ago exist in that space as well on the credit side. But the elephant in the room is the \u2013 really the pricing of auto loans at this point by a number of players. And while that is not directly a credit concern, it lowers the margin in the business, it lowers the buffer of resilience and so on, and we manage very carefully to trying to keep a maximum amount of resilience in downturns and lower margins lead us to pull back on the least resilient parts of the business.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Great. Thanks very much.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks. Rich, you had an earlier question about kind of the change in delinquency rates. And I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m wondering whether if you think that this cycle, there will be a different \u2013 any sort of different relationship in your two major businesses in card and auto between the loss rate and delinquency rate better or worse as we go through the next 18 months or so of credit normalization?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, Moshe, as usual, that\u2019s a very insightful question. Let me just comment a little bit on \u2013 just a little bit of a calibration of how we think about credit in the card and auto businesses. The first point would be, it\u2019s normalizing in both places. But overall, credit has been strong in both our card and our auto business. But there are three effects that are driving faster normalization of auto losses, then of card losses. And the first is that normalization tends to be more pronounced in the front book of new originations. That\u2019s a universal thing that applies across our consumer businesses. But because the front book \u2013 in auto, the front book replaces the portfolio much more quickly. Then in card, overall portfolio losses should normalize more quickly in the auto business. The second is that recovery rates are much higher in auto than in card. Now recoveries tend to be lagged relative to charge-offs. But \u2013 so some of the exceptionally strong performance we saw in auto, including the quarter where we actually had negative charge-offs, that was boosted by higher recoveries from earlier charge-offs. Now that we\u2019ve seen low charge-offs for an extended period in auto, the raw material for future recoveries is coming down, even if the recovery rate stays strong, and this will have a bigger impact in auto than in card. But it will be an effect in both businesses, and it\u2019s not something that I think gets a lot of airtime out there, but recoveries are definitionally about what\u2019s happening with , if you will, the back book of recoveries. And in both of our businesses, the back book, which has been the byproduct of the great news over the last few years in terms of credit to back book, there\u2019s just less to work with, but it\u2019s especially an effect in auto. And finally, auto vehicle values are now normalizing, which is a headwind relative to a year ago and contributes to the pace of credit normalization in that business. And given where used car prices have been going to sort of record levels over the past year, the general direction of that is much more likely to be down rather than up so that also contributes to a difference between those two businesses.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. And as a follow-up, it\u2019s good to see the guidance or some form of expectation of an improving efficiency ratio. But as I look at it, it seems like your balance sheet is still asset sensitive. And so to the extent that revenue growth is impacted and positively impacted by margin expansion, I mean, wouldn\u2019t one really naturally expect to see that efficiency ratio improve because that doesn\u2019t really come with a lot of attendant costs? So, I\u2019m just wondering how to think about that? And what\u2019s the right way to think about the spend \u2013 kind of like-for-like spending versus revenue growth?\nAndrew Young: Moshe, let me take the first part of that, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich in terms of asset sensitivity. You can see last quarter\u2019s Q, and I would expect it will be a fairly similar number this quarter, an up 100 basis point shock. Last quarter was 70 basis point impact to 12-month NII, which is something like a couple of $100 million of NII. And again, that\u2019s a shock relative to forwards. So, I just want to clarify that when you talk about us being asset sensitive, we\u2019ve already baked into our baseline the anticipated, call it, 150 basis points of additional Fed moves over the next couple of quarters. So achieving what I just described suggests the shock beyond that. But I think you should walk around with at this point, we are pretty neutral from an asset sensitivity. So, I just wanted to clarify that before Rich provides the broader answer.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Moshe, the \u2013 I\u2019ve often said \u2013 and you and I have gosh, we\u2019ve been working together for two or three decades now, Moshe. And I\u2019ve often said that \u2013 I know we do a calculation that says this is on the things that we can measure. This is the impact of, let\u2019s say, a rise in rates. I\u2019ve often said, it can look good on paper to have a rise in rates, but I for three decades have been rooting against rises in rates because of the sort of unquantifiable other aspects on the business. Now of course, no one out here is rooting for the kind of inflation that we\u2019re seeing and the kind of risk there. But I just want to flag that while the math talks about certain benefits that come just a couple kind of obvious, but I think important things that affect many of our metrics in the business. One is the conversation that we just had about the auto business. I think it\u2019s \u2013 most businesses in the world, most industries struggle when the cost of goods sold goes up, struggle to get that to make its way into pricing. And the auto business is a classic example of this. And particularly since, unlike if you\u2019re selling groceries at the store, it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s the cost of goods sold, and therefore, how you might want to price those groceries in this business with the complexity that comes from how any particular auto lender calculates their funds, transfer pricing and really effectively what is their margin that can put pressures in the business. And what we\u2019re seeing in auto, the compression in margins, the growth opportunity that we\u2019re losing right now, that can sort of swamp the math of Andrew\u2019s interest rate calculations. And then, of course, I think the biggest issue is the impact of rising rates on the economy and on potentially credit outcomes. And back to our friend the operating efficiency ratio, credit impacts make their way into the operating efficiency ratio, of course, through \u2013 well, through the growth \u2013 through how much growth we can get and also things like the fee and finance charge reserve impacts that come. So I\u2019m not \u2013 yes, so that\u2019s why I think, in many ways, the kind of progress that we continue to hope to achieve over the years an operating efficiency ratio might be more in spite of rather than because of higher rates.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is now open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the card acquisitions that you\u2019re having today and you\u2019re a full spectrum lender, but your, I guess \u2013 I would characterize, I guess, newer in the heavy spend section and with your Venture X card. Are you acquiring more of that segment? And then also have you been pulling back at all in maybe revolver nonprime segment recently?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So the \u2013 we have talked a lot about the traction that we\u2019re getting at the top of the market in the pursuit of heavy spenders. And I wouldn\u2019t call us relatively new player in that business. We\u2019re one of the actually pretty significant players in the space, but certainly not the biggest, not even close. But I think that \u2013 the bigger point there is that we continue to see more traction there. And whenever we \u2013 you see metrics about growth in purchase volume, we don\u2019t share metrics about what kind of growth rate we\u2019re getting at each spender level in the marketplace. But the higher the spender level, the higher \u2013 the even faster growth rate we\u2019ve been getting. So that\u2019s a manifestation of the success we\u2019re getting. And it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s both the byproduct of the investment we\u2019re making, but also leads us to continue to lean in to those investments. But for all you hear of our enthusiastic comments about the top of the market, I don\u2019t want to leave an impression that we are therefore less enthusiastic about the opportunity elsewhere. We continue to grow across the credit spectrum. We have several decades of experience in the lower end of the market and one of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication, more data, more machine learning and other things into the credit underwriting process. And that allows us to be stronger and have more growth opportunities and better credit quality in the \u2013 at the lower end of the market. So the story, the net impression I want to leave with you is one of very continued success across the spectrum. There are places, however, that we for a long period of time have been cautious about and frankly doing our best to minimize. And one of those is high balance revolvers. So high balance revolvers, which just what the term we \u2013 that term to us just to clarify that concept is not necessarily what are the balances that any revolver, any customer might have with us, but it\u2019s collectively their total bureau balances. And we have been very cautious about booking customers for years now. And even more so after the great recession, booking customers with a high level of balance \u2013 revolver balances across their \u2013 that consumer\u2019s portfolio. It tends to be a \u2013 to not go there ties one hand behind her back a little bit in terms of growth because growing high balance revolvers is a great \u2013 a good way to grow. And it\u2019s also tends to be quite profitable business. But that is a segment that we have been concerned about the resilience and downturns. And so we\u2019ve tended to for years now try to deemphasize that. I say deemphasize, that no one can fully get out of a segment like that, because the \u2013 we can\u2019t control whether our own customers turn into high balance revolvers, but what we can control is whether they enter as high balance revolvers. So that\u2019s a little window into maybe where we go a little more lightly.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDon Fandetti: Hey, Rich. Can you talk a little bit on the move to the public cloud? It\u2019s been a bit since we\u2019ve heard a lot on that. Are you still feeling like it\u2019s improving your new product development rollout?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, Don, we feel great about our move to the public cloud. It\u2019s a central part of our technology transformation. Probably the most salient part of it, but certainly not the only part. But this transformation has involved \u2013 a transformation in terms of the tech talent within the company, bringing lots of thousands of engineers in-house, bringing more of the tech investment inside the company as opposed to reliance on vendors, so many of them industrywide who are old school legacy vendors and quite expensive. Is that \u2013 at that it\u2019s involving \u2013 involved transforming how we build software. It\u2019s involved going to the cloud, it\u2019s involved transforming our data ecosystem. It\u2019s involved modernizing all of the applications on which the company is built. So there\u2019s been a lot to this journey and we\u2019re a decade into it. The benefits are all around us and it really starts in many ways with benefits in the tech business itself, where our technology teams are moving faster, getting products to market sooner. And our software engineers are just way more modern tech stack to work with and automated software delivery methods and can also to your cloud point benefit by the tremendous, not just, well, the tremendous and continuing innovations that are happening on the cloud. Our customer experiences to continue to get more and more just better and better. And some of the \u2013 we notice it in net promoter scores and occasional awards that Capital One wins. The new products we\u2019ve been able to innovate things like Capital One Shopping, virtual cards, dealer navigator, instant issuance. Many things have been very benefited there. I mentioned earlier the ability to get some transformational improvements on underwriting, fraud management, and a lot of things behind the scenes that leverage the power of big data and machine learning in real time. That has been very beneficial. Our transformation also is changing how we work inside Capital One, our new marketing platforms. Part of the reason that we\u2019re investing more these days in marketing is really the power of mass customized machine learning driven marketing. So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a good thing. And it\u2019s also, as I mentioned earlier had a bunch of benefits in terms of enhancing productivity of the business. And the final thing I would say there Don, is that the tech transformation is really helping us get more of the thing we needed to start with to make it happen and that was talent. The biggest elephant in the room for corporate America who sit on legacy tech stacks is you need lots and lots of very modern, best-in-class tech talent in order to drive that transformation in a world where the scarcest, the tightest and most competitive labor market I\u2019ve seen in the history of building Capital One is the competition for really modern tech talent. The transformation requires so much of that talent. And one of our rewards is now as we get on the other side of the canyon and really have a tech stack build like the very modern tech companies, the ability to attract talent is accelerating. And that\u2019s part of a virtuous cycle. That is why we did it, is why we went on this journey, and it\u2019s something that we see to this very day, and it\u2019s also why we continue to invest more in the opportunities that we see.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRick Shane: Hey guys, it\u2019s Rick Shane. I think guys got called on. Andrew, quick question for you. When we look at the reserve rate on the domestic card portfolio, it ticked up slightly most of the build was a function of portfolio growth. Context is year-over-year, the single biggest increase in delinquencies that we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m curious, when you think about the factor setting the allowance going forward, have you incorporated the trajectory of how fast delinquencies are increasing or is it a function of where delinquencies are now and in economic outlook? And can you capture that sort of rate of change?\nAndrew Young: Sure, Rick. Well, let me just start by talking about the inputs to the allowance. I just think it\u2019s important to sort of ground on the mechanics, the entirety of the mechanics, not just the piece that you called out. So, the first factor of course is just the size of the balance sheet. The second is really aligned to what you were just talking about, but it\u2019s kind of a combination of factors, and that is really our outlook for future losses, net of recoveries against that balance sheet. So that starts from a place of looking at what is in the delinquency buckets today, which gives us a really good view of how the next, say six months or so of losses are going to play out. And then after that period, we have an assumption of continued normalization from those unusually strong levels. And then beyond that horizon, as I think, under CECL, there\u2019s just an assumption of a gradual revision to historical averages. And then the third point is we apply qualitative factors against all of those expectations to account for uncertainties around economic downsides and inflation related risks. And so when we think about the allowance going forward, yes, I mean, today\u2019s allowance of course does incorporate in what is in the delinquency bucket today and what that implies. But as we go forward, the allowance is really going to primarily be determined by just the growth in the balance sheet. And we saw that impact the allowance this quarter. But then secondly, every quarter we continue to normalize, we are going to be replacing lower loss content of the current quarter with higher loss content of future quarters, which again, will be informed by how the delinquencies are playing through each successive quarter. So there\u2019s a number of other modest considerations, but that\u2019s really the two big forces at play. And hopefully that gets to kind of the nature of your question.\nRick Shane: It does. And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is that if we follow the path that you expect in terms of normalization and what\u2019s embedded in the reserves today and economic outlook doesn\u2019t change. Again, I realize that\u2019s something you can\u2019t control. If you follow the expected path will, does that mean the allowance stay static or do you follow along that path? I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m really trying to get to.\nAndrew Young: Well, you\u2019re going to follow along that path because then when we get to a quarter from now, we\u2019re going to apply all of those same factors to the allowance at a quarter from now. And the change in the allowance is just going to be the quantum of allowance we have today compared to the quantum of allowance that we would have doing those exact same things a quarter from now.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on that last question. What level of unemployment would you say is implicit in your allowance and marrying some of the micro with the macro from the earlier discussion? How does Capital One view the risk that some of the credit normalization trends that you\u2019re seeing currently will ultimately be accompanied by some degree of degradation to the extent that the Fed proceeds through the hiking cycle?\nAndrew Young: Why don\u2019t I take the first one, and I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I followed the second. So I\u2019ll see if Rich followed that. Otherwise we\u2019ll come back to you for clarification. But in terms of unemployment, I\u2019m not going to provide specific metrics or economic assumptions. I will say though, Bill, we are generally consumers of like industry forecast as opposed to developing our own. So I think you could look at general consensus expectations for all of the key economic variables and assume that kind of roughly approximates what underlies our economic views on those variables. And I\u2019m looking at Rich to see if he followed the second part of your question.\nRichard Fairbank: Bill, I think, your question was, I\u2019m going to put it in different words just to see if I\u2019m saying the same thing.\nBill Carcache: Okay.\nRichard Fairbank: We\u2019ve got normalization going on right now with an economy that\u2019s in some ways, certainly employment wise and some metrics not in a terrible place. And you have normalization \u2013 when normalization meets potentially significant economic worsening coming out of the or maybe catalyzed by the Fed going through their tightening right now. How do we feel about that? Was that your question?\nBill Carcache: Yes.\nRichard Fairbank: I\u2019m going to start doing earnings calls by just asking the questions and then answering them. So \u2013 but look, that is a great question and I think none of us should just be mathematical about normalization. Now, I\u2019ve talked about how the root word in normalization is normal because what is abnormal is that credit ever got to this once in a lifetime place it did during the pandemic. So as I\u2019ve said in the \u2013 in absolutely normal times, this thing should normalize. So the way \u2013 so we look at that and say, and expect that should continue. And then we look at the economy and the way that we would always look at that is we\u2019ve done, many times we\u2019ve been looking down the gun barrel of a potentially highly uncertain and maybe likely a worse economy. And it\u2019s certainly hard to be in the prediction business. But what we do is we \u2013 there\u2019s couple of big things that we do as an approach. First of all, we underwrite to an assumption of worsening. We try to make it so if things go bad, it\u2019s not a surprise that it would be really bad banking to \u2013 it\u2019d be underwriting to good scenarios. And I know everyone tries to be conservative, but I\u2019m just saying with over three decades in building this company, at the heart of it is underwriting that looks in the rear view mirror of how programs are doing and overlaying a worsening assumption on that because that is could happen, and we need to be resilient to that. So you\u2019ll often hear Capital One talking about the word resilient \u2013 resilience. Without a crystal ball about what\u2019s going to happen over time, the critical thing is what is the resilience of the loans that we are booking. And we spend a lot of time, for example, in the card business, just looking at the ratio of revenue margin to the charge-off rates and stressing that and all kinds of things. So we underwrite to worsening. That\u2019s a very important thing. Secondly, it is the management of credit decisions at the micro level so that we\u2019re looking for the earliest indications of where problems can occur. And like I said earlier, that\u2019s both \u2013 there\u2019s \u2013 let me just give you a little bit of window into that. We, of course, have our way that we look at how all our businesses are doing and all of our vintages are doing. We leverage machine learning though, to also look for aberrations and anomalies that happened faster than they would show up with a report and maybe coming from sources that would not be our standard set of variables by which otherwise, our models would look at the business. And so real-time machine learning-driven monitoring is really important in any environment, but we \u2013 it\u2019s really important in an environment like this because we\u2019re looking for \u2013 because we expect anomalies to happen, we expect some of our segments to be stressed in even the current environment certainly as things get worse, and so we\u2019re on the lookout and we have machine learning to help us. And then as I mentioned earlier, and sorry to be repetitive, but \u2013 but then \u2013 but it\u2019s not just letting the machines and the models do the work is standing back and saying, gathering people around and saying, let\u2019s think of all the things that could go wrong, what do you think will go wrong and what \u2013 where would weaknesses appear. And then based on that intuition, we go hunting for them. And all of the different approaches have been bearing fruit lately on a more modest basis in the card business and a little bit bigger basis in the auto business. And I would expect as the environment gets a whole lot worse from here, we\u2019re going to \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a lot of active trimming all over the place. And so it\u2019s a combination of literally the most micro and analytical approaches marrying the most intuitive and big picture judgmental approach to managing risk.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, thank you. I think just \u2013 follow. But I wanted to ask about the \u2013 I appreciate your comments earlier about you\u2019re enthusiastic about all of card lending so full spectrum. But just given the recent focus on the higher spend and the more transactor-type customers, I was wondering if you think that growing that portion a little bit, maybe that portion has been growing at an outsized rate, how is that growth of that subsegment potentially change the card portfolio\u2019s performance through the cycle or in a downturn?\nRichard Fairbank: That is a great question. In fact, let me pull up for a second before I answer your question. We have very gradually across the business, paralleling the move to the top of the market. All across our business, we have been leaning harder into the spender side of the business and just continuing to be most attracted to customers who are there to spend whose patterns would be more consistent with the spending side of the business even as there is a bunch of revolving. So across our business, there has been a very gradual but purposeful migration for years toward the spender side. So I\u2019ll put that down there. And then the second thing is the avoidance of high-balance revolvers. And then thirdly, the thing you\u2019re pointing to the \u2013 importantly, increasing mix of heavy spenders in our business. That the impact, I think when a downturn comes, these things that we\u2019ve been leading into and things we\u2019ve been avoiding should be all other things equal beneficial to the performance of the business in terms of the credit losses themselves, the payment rates that we experienced there during the business. And part of why we have leaned into spenders more is just because all the evidence that we have seen is that it tends to just be pound for pound a more resilient group. So while it\u2019s not a controlled experiment, I think the net effect of these changes will be beneficial to the credit results. And I think, enhance the resilience of the business that we have booked.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you. And then just if I could ask just about the tech investments that you\u2019ve been making. Can you talk about just how do they improve your ability to flex expenses as the competitive or macro environment changes? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Ironically, I think they may be \u2013 make things a little less flexible to \u2013 on the expense side, let me explain that. An increasing part of our cost structure as a company is our \u2013is the tech business that we have built. It\u2019s got a lot of fixed cost to it. And so that is not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to set an expectation that our sort of tech stack and our tech company that we have built is a more variable cost business because if anything, it might be a little more fixed cost business. Now there within that, choices on what we invest in and the timing of those always create flexibility. And in stressful times, they\u2019re certainly on the investment side within tech can be more flexibility there. But the tech investment though pulling way up has tremendously enhanced Capital One\u2019s overall flexibility. Our ability to turn quickly in the marketplace to make credit choices. If you look back to the \u2013 when we all went \u2013 when the world went into vertical free fall of uncertainty in the pandemic, just look back at how quickly Capital One turned with respect to some of the pullbacks we did, that would not have been possible in the more legacy world that we lived in before. So the ability to respond quickly, the ability to create changes in the offerings to consumers the ability to create \u2013 we have flexibility and offerings, flexibility and forbearance, new ways to adapt to the marketplace. Everything about Capital One, the speed of change of managed change is dramatically different from before. We also \u2013 and this is probably the most important recession resilience point is the monitoring point I made earlier, to have put in place a much more comprehensive real-time monitoring capability with root cause analysis that\u2019s much more comprehensive than what we could have done before will allow us to be informed earlier on about things that are happening. And I do want to say I\u2019ve been asked by a number of investors. Rich, we know you well enough to know how cautious you are about the economy and about downturns and the utmost respect for what \u2013 how risk can play out in these businesses, why are you leaning into the marketing opportunity? And one of the reasons that we\u2019re doing that is this substantially improved measurement, monitoring and speed of response and the level of segmentation and micro segmentation by which we can do that gives us \u2013 allows the sort of paradoxical thing to lean in more than we otherwise might have been able to do.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our final question this evening comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, can you hear me? This is Dominick from Oppenheimer.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Dominick.\nAndrew Young: Yes.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Sorry. I guess so \u2013 is there any reason, Rich, why you would expect the payment hierarchy among consumer products in which they choose to pay or default, let\u2019s say, in times of severe stress, is there any reason why anything you\u2019re seeing that would change that hierarchy this cycle around from previous cycles? And then I just have a follow-up. Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Dominick, that\u2019s a great question. I can only sort of speculate here, but the most striking thing about the global financial crisis and Great Recession that \u2013 from a payment hierarchy point of view is what we saw with people literally walking away from their mortgages and what was really high on the payment hierarchy was auto loans. And we \u2013 and that may be a kind of a more universal resilience point on the auto side because people still have to drive to work. And so that\u2019s probably more of a sustaining insight. I think that the, we got to look at student loans and think about where \u2013 I think we\u2019ve already observed that\u2019s pretty low in the payment hierarchy and trends these days and forgiveness and various things there would probably ensure that\u2019s on the lower end. Another one that I would probably just speculate to add to the hierarchy this year is this time around is fintechs. And I think the fintechs who don\u2019t report to the credit bureaus may have enjoyed their stealth opportunity to grow, but that\u2019s probably not lost on the consumers. And so I think one of the reasons, we\u2019ve really leaned harder into having spending be the anchor part of a consumer credit card relationship is that it\u2019s not only a healthier place to be from the consumer point of view. But I think, counting on that credit card and making sure that you\u2019ve got that in a downturn, that helps from a payment hierarchy point of view.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Great. And then just \u2013 when you just think of \u2013 I just want to go back to the tech investment and spend and how you think about it over the cycle and perhaps even some of the peers that you talked to at conferences. How do you as one of the country\u2019s largest banks think about the investment that you put on? And what do you find does have what type of economic factors? Is it NIM? Is it NII growth changes or the credit growth changes that can have you put the brakes on the edges on year-over-year growth and tech investment spend? Thank you so much.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Dominick. These are all great questions. We \u2013 in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I have a pretty deep conviction about the benefit of these tech investments, and that\u2019s not just how I feel, that\u2019s how all of us collectively feel here at Capital One. And the benefits of that tech investment are so comprehensive, although the company inside this company, we can see them everywhere. And they do so enhance how we work, the ability to manage risk, the ability to serve customers, the ability to create new products, the ability to grow. And so we do \u2013 and because we see such benefits, we are continuing to lean into tech investments. And as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s sort of under the surface quite a bit of productivity gain coming from the tech investment. But on the other hand, at the same time, we\u2019re leaning in pretty hard into tech investments such that it\u2019s \u2013 the effects are not that dramatic. In fact, over close to a decade, there\u2019s been a more gradual kind of improvement in operating efficiency. We \u2013 there\u2019s always the opportunity if times get really tough to pull back on tech investments, but we are not viewing these like luxury investments and just what to do on a sunny day because they are very materially transforming the opportunities of this company and the ability to manage risk and the ability to weather the very downturn that might motivate that reduction in investment.\nJeff Norris: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the conference call - Capital One. Remember, the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer further questions you may have. Have a good evening, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 16% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $22 billion or about 22% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate are well below pre-pandemic levels and continue to normalize. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.2%, up 84 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.97%, 104 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 6 basis points. The delinquency rate was up 62 basis points from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the third quarter of 2021, including an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $978 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders continued in the third quarter. Heavy spender marketing includes early spend bonuses driven by continued strong account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. In the third quarter, our marketing continued to drive strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with both new and existing customers. Our decade-long quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing. But the sustained revenue, credit, resilience, and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they're growing. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, we continued to pull back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. Many auto lenders appear to have reflected rising interest rates in their marginal pricing decisions, but others have not, and they have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 28% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in originations, Consumer Banking loan growth is slower than previous quarters. Third quarter ending loans grew 5% to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. Third quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking deposits were flat compared to the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was up 7% year-over-year as growth in auto loans was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins and the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. Non-interest expense was up 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and the increased marketing for our digital national bank. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the third quarter. The charge-off rate for the third quarter was 1.05%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.85%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 44 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 2% from the sequential quarter, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were up 7% in the quarter. Ending deposits were up 6% from the second quarter. Average deposits were down 2% in the quarter. Third quarter revenue was up 12% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 12%. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the third quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.97%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.57%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the third quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we pulled back on auto originations, and our Commercial Banking business posted another growth \u2013 another quarter of strong revenue growth. Credit results remain strong across our businesses. Charge-off rates and delinquency rates are below pre-pandemic levels and credit continues to normalize. We typically see an increase in operating expense over the second half of the year \u2013 of any year. This year, the timing of some of our investment opportunities drove a larger than usual third quarter increase in operating expense, which was up 11% from the second quarter. We expect that this year's linked quarter increase in fourth quarter operating expense will be smaller than the approximately 7% linked quarter increase we've seen on average over the last five years. Turning to operating efficiency ratio. Relative to full year 2021, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat in 2022 and modestly down in 2023. As usual, our operating expense and efficiency expectations exclude any potential adjusting items. Pulling way up, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value as modern digital technology continues to transform banking. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our digital transformation. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a position to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Yes, Kevin, so thank you for your question. Let me just pull up and just comment on normalization. First of all, the context of where we are because consumer credit remain strong, as you can see from the metrics. And our Domestic Card losses in the third quarter were about half of pre-pandemic levels. And our delinquencies are \u2013 and we've often said this, unmistakably normalizing. But right now, they remain about 20% below pre-pandemic level. There is not a certain point where we \u2013 we don't look out there and say if the rate of growth of delinquencies exceeds a certain number, then we will pull back. But let me comment, first of all, that we've said for a long time, Kevin, and I know you know this that normalization is bound to happen. It would be shocking if it didn't happen. And we've been talking for a bunch of quarters now saying it started you needed a magnifying glass to see it and we talked about that. And now, of course, you can see it in the numbers, and it's definitely normalizing. What \u2013 the rate at which it's normalizing is, frankly, more gradual than we generally expected, but we didn't really have a road map to know exactly what pace it would normalize, we just believe so strongly that it would. So what we do with \u2013 rather than say there's a certain number that would lead us to make a certain decision, we, of course, look at this with what's happening with every segment and micro segment of our business and how it's performing. We look for starters at the back book, and that is normalizing as \u2013 well, frankly, like everything here, more gradually than expected, but still the back book is clearly normalizing as well. We then look for other patterns of normalization. And here are some of the patterns that we see, Kevin. It's more pronounced in the front book of new originations than in the existing back book. And by the way, it would be \u2013 that would be shocking if it weren't the case because 100% of the time in our history, front books normalize faster during periods of change. And we \u2013 so that \u2013 but we confirm again that front books are normalizing faster. It also seems that normalization is more pronounced at the lower end of the market. And of course, those are the populations that improve more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. Lower income consumers may also be feeling more pressure from inflation. So these trends shouldn't be surprising. But at the \u2013 at kind of a high level, what we see is very normal and is \u2013 and basically, the way we're leaning into the marketplace is very consistent with what we've been saying for a bunch of quarters now. But what we do at the micro level, at the segment level and the sub-segment level is look at the various metrics, both on the back book and on the front book to see what the patterns are, and we're comfortable with what we see in terms of front book vintage curves as a general point and across a vast majority of all the segments that we operate in. We have \u2013 around the edges, we've done a little bit of dialing back in particular pockets where metrics are normalizing a little bit faster. We also sort of pull up and say, what are the kinds of \u2013 what are the risks that we would expect to see at a time like this with orthogonal looks through our book. And we brainstorm on what all the risk we could see, we go hunt for them. And in a couple of places, we have seen effects that caused a little bit of trimming around the edges, but the collective amount of trimming in the card business is pretty small relative to the overall scale of our growth. As you know, the \u2013 in the auto business, we have pulled back. At the very same time, we're leaning into the card business, we're pulling back in the auto business, but maybe I'll save that for another question. Sorry, the changes in the corporate \u2013 can you repeat that last part, changes in corporate outlook. Well, the \u2013 we, of course, at the whole time, we're doing the micro examination of one segment at a time. We are looking at the macro trends. It's really striking the level of inflation. And as I've often said, we collectively, everybody on this call, none of us \u2013 and \u2013 nobody across the business world has really lived something like this since the early \u201880s. So we're especially looking for effects that might be different this time, Kevin, with respect to inflation and the \u2013 how that can play out. But \u2013 so we're always on the lookout, but the net impression, I would want to leave here is very much the same impression that I've left with you the last many quarters here. Hey, Ryan. So I don't think we're here to declare a \u2013 I want to make a comment about marketing seasonality. It's not as \u2013 that's not as much of a physics kind of thing as certain things like credit and delinquency seasonality with consumers. I think \u2013 so I'm not here to declare changes in the pattern of seasonality and marketing. The big driver of our marketing is the opportunities that we see as well as the investment in building businesses like our heavy spender business and our national bank. With respect to the drivers of operating efficiency improvement, just kind of pulling up on the journey that you mentioned. We've been focused about this and talking with investors about operating efficiency for years. And we've achieved a 440 basis point improvement from 2013 through 2021 even as we have invested in a comprehensive transformation of our technology over that same period of time. And we know that investing in technology modernization and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. Technology investment helps our revenue growth and helps drive productivity improvements. And beneath the surface of the high level of investment has been significant productivity gains from modernizing our tech stack, eliminating legacy vendor costs, driving customers to digital and driving more automation in the company. And at the same time, of course, we have continued to lean into this technology journey and the opportunities that it generates. And the \u2013 so it's a very shared path. And I think that our guidance for modest improvement in 2023 is a reflection of continued traction in growth and operating productivity while also continuing to invest in future opportunities. Hey, Betsy. Thanks, Andrew. Betsy, we \u2013 so with the question with respect to why did you slow down your share repurchase pace this quarter. So we repurchased roughly $300 million of shares during the third quarter. About 1.5 years ago, we had a CET1 in the high 14s. Since then, we've been repurchasing shares and our CET1 ratio has come down into the low 12s. And the pace of our repurchases is, of course, driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, of course, growth, economic conditions, market dynamics. And at this point, there remains some pretty sizable error bars around some of these factors, particularly growth and economic uncertainty. And so it's not lost on us at times like this. It's prudent risk management to be conservative with our capital actions. And this is a very dynamic process. And under the new SCB rules, we're able to maintain flexibility in our capital decisions. Well, Sanjay, did you want me to talk about competition in those spaces? Or is it a competition-driven question? Right. So, let's talk about competition in the card business, and then I'll talk about it in the auto business. But generally, in the card business, competition continues to be high, but largely stable and rational over the past few quarters. Now here, I'm really talking about the major \u2013 the banking industry, the classic competitive set within the card business. But we certainly have seen marketing levels that have returned to really beyond pre-pandemic levels. So, we certainly have an eye on that. On the rewards competition side, there's \u2013 here or there, there are new things that people come out with, but there's generally a stability in that space on APRs in the card business have generally \u2013 the issuers have generally adjusted headline rates along with the change in the prime rate. So there's a kind of a stability in the margins there. And so again, we see a pretty stable competitive environment in the major \u2013 among major card players. A thing that we've mentioned a number of times is concerned about the fintechs and their impact on a business like the card business, less so by the fintechs actually running around issuing credit cards, but more by the impact from other credit products like installment loans, buy-now-pay-later loans and others that can affect the portfolio of borrowing that our customers, current and prospective customers might have. So, we were pretty concerned and we've talked about it a number of times about the rapidly growing extent of fintech credit extension compounded by the fact no one could measure the size of it, because many of these folks like many of the buy-now-pay-later players, for example, not reporting to the credit bureaus. The other thing that caught our eye, of course, all along the way here is, virtually every fintech that enters lending, enters in the lower side of the market. There's virtually no one that enters right at the heaviest vendor side of the market. They just don't have the scale for those thin-margin businesses. And so the fintech accesses to the extent that they're there were logically and inferentially from what we see would be more in the lower end of the market, and that, of course, is something we watch pretty carefully to the best extent that we can see it. Now the one thing that, that just intuitively is a helpful thing to the cause here is that fintechs have generally struggled. They seem to have dialed back quite a bit. So there may be less pressure in that particular space. But another thing to keep our eye out for here is it's not just the amount of volume of marketing or the intensity of competition is the underwriting choices that folks make. Another thing that, Sanjay, that we have had our eye on is basically FICO drift. And you can absolutely see out there the reduction in the size of the subprime population. Now we can all ask ourselves is that really just great news that the size of subprime America has declined or how much is that a shorter-term impact from all the stimulus, the forbearance, the spending pullbacks and things that happened during the pandemic. So, we ourselves do our best to try to normalize for those effects in our underwriting. And so where I would [Audio Gap] to say, I think the competitive risks that exist and that we have seen out there are more in the lower end of the marketplace even with credit cards themselves. If you look at the data, there has been the highest \u2013 there's been more growth in the lower end of the market in terms of just credit card customers than anywhere else. So all of this is something we're watching incredibly carefully. And to the earlier question that was asked about how do we do underwriting, we, of course, do everything we can to look at every segment and the \u2013 to look for any changes that we're seeing ultimately in our own performance. We've trimmed around the edges in a few places. But overall, so far, it looks pretty good, but partly how we do this. We don't just run around and just let the numbers do the talking. We do a combination of using actually machine learning monitoring-based methodologies to look for early signs of things being off of expectation within our portfolio. And then at the same time, broad strategic logic on what would you expect to happen from this competitive environment, from this credit environment, from this inflationary environment. So that's a window into that side of the business. On the auto side of the business, the competition, I don't \u2013 our issue with the competition is really not an underwriting issue at this point. The general risks that we talked about just a couple of minutes ago exist in that space as well on the credit side. But the elephant in the room is the \u2013 really the pricing of auto loans at this point by a number of players. And while that is not directly a credit concern, it lowers the margin in the business, it lowers the buffer of resilience and so on, and we manage very carefully to trying to keep a maximum amount of resilience in downturns and lower margins lead us to pull back on the least resilient parts of the business. Well, Moshe, as usual, that's a very insightful question. Let me just comment a little bit on \u2013 just a little bit of a calibration of how we think about credit in the card and auto businesses. The first point would be, it's normalizing in both places. But overall, credit has been strong in both our card and our auto business. But there are three effects that are driving faster normalization of auto losses, then of card losses. And the first is that normalization tends to be more pronounced in the front book of new originations. That's a universal thing that applies across our consumer businesses. But because the front book \u2013 in auto, the front book replaces the portfolio much more quickly. Then in card, overall portfolio losses should normalize more quickly in the auto business. The second is that recovery rates are much higher in auto than in card. Now recoveries tend to be lagged relative to charge-offs. But \u2013 so some of the exceptionally strong performance we saw in auto, including the quarter where we actually had negative charge-offs, that was boosted by higher recoveries from earlier charge-offs. Now that we've seen low charge-offs for an extended period in auto, the raw material for future recoveries is coming down, even if the recovery rate stays strong, and this will have a bigger impact in auto than in card. But it will be an effect in both businesses, and it's not something that I think gets a lot of airtime out there, but recoveries are definitionally about what's happening with , if you will, the back book of recoveries. And in both of our businesses, the back book, which has been the byproduct of the great news over the last few years in terms of credit to back book, there's just less to work with, but it's especially an effect in auto. And finally, auto vehicle values are now normalizing, which is a headwind relative to a year ago and contributes to the pace of credit normalization in that business. And given where used car prices have been going to sort of record levels over the past year, the general direction of that is much more likely to be down rather than up so that also contributes to a difference between those two businesses. Yes, Moshe, the \u2013 I've often said \u2013 and you and I have gosh, we've been working together for two or three decades now, Moshe. And I've often said that \u2013 I know we do a calculation that says this is on the things that we can measure. This is the impact of, let's say, a rise in rates. I've often said, it can look good on paper to have a rise in rates, but I for three decades have been rooting against rises in rates because of the sort of unquantifiable other aspects on the business. Now of course, no one out here is rooting for the kind of inflation that we're seeing and the kind of risk there. But I just want to flag that while the math talks about certain benefits that come just a couple kind of obvious, but I think important things that affect many of our metrics in the business. One is the conversation that we just had about the auto business. I think it's \u2013 most businesses in the world, most industries struggle when the cost of goods sold goes up, struggle to get that to make its way into pricing. And the auto business is a classic example of this. And particularly since, unlike if you're selling groceries at the store, it's pretty clear what's the cost of goods sold, and therefore, how you might want to price those groceries in this business with the complexity that comes from how any particular auto lender calculates their funds, transfer pricing and really effectively what is their margin that can put pressures in the business. And what we're seeing in auto, the compression in margins, the growth opportunity that we're losing right now, that can sort of swamp the math of Andrew's interest rate calculations. And then, of course, I think the biggest issue is the impact of rising rates on the economy and on potentially credit outcomes. And back to our friend the operating efficiency ratio, credit impacts make their way into the operating efficiency ratio, of course, through \u2013 well, through the growth \u2013 through how much growth we can get and also things like the fee and finance charge reserve impacts that come. So I'm not \u2013 yes, so that's why I think, in many ways, the kind of progress that we continue to hope to achieve over the years an operating efficiency ratio might be more in spite of rather than because of higher rates. Yes. So the \u2013 we have talked a lot about the traction that we're getting at the top of the market in the pursuit of heavy spenders. And I wouldn't call us relatively new player in that business. We're one of the actually pretty significant players in the space, but certainly not the biggest, not even close. But I think that \u2013 the bigger point there is that we continue to see more traction there. And whenever we \u2013 you see metrics about growth in purchase volume, we don't share metrics about what kind of growth rate we're getting at each spender level in the marketplace. But the higher the spender level, the higher \u2013 the even faster growth rate we've been getting. So that's a manifestation of the success we're getting. And it's a \u2013 it's both the byproduct of the investment we're making, but also leads us to continue to lean in to those investments. But for all you hear of our enthusiastic comments about the top of the market, I don't want to leave an impression that we are therefore less enthusiastic about the opportunity elsewhere. We continue to grow across the credit spectrum. We have several decades of experience in the lower end of the market and one of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication, more data, more machine learning and other things into the credit underwriting process. And that allows us to be stronger and have more growth opportunities and better credit quality in the \u2013 at the lower end of the market. So the story, the net impression I want to leave with you is one of very continued success across the spectrum. There are places, however, that we for a long period of time have been cautious about and frankly doing our best to minimize. And one of those is high balance revolvers. So high balance revolvers, which just what the term we \u2013 that term to us just to clarify that concept is not necessarily what are the balances that any revolver, any customer might have with us, but it's collectively their total bureau balances. And we have been very cautious about booking customers for years now. And even more so after the great recession, booking customers with a high level of balance \u2013 revolver balances across their \u2013 that consumer's portfolio. It tends to be a \u2013 to not go there ties one hand behind her back a little bit in terms of growth because growing high balance revolvers is a great \u2013 a good way to grow. And it's also tends to be quite profitable business. But that is a segment that we have been concerned about the resilience and downturns. And so we've tended to for years now try to deemphasize that. I say deemphasize, that no one can fully get out of a segment like that, because the \u2013 we can't control whether our own customers turn into high balance revolvers, but what we can control is whether they enter as high balance revolvers. So that's a little window into maybe where we go a little more lightly. Yes. Well, Don, we feel great about our move to the public cloud. It's a central part of our technology transformation. Probably the most salient part of it, but certainly not the only part. But this transformation has involved \u2013 a transformation in terms of the tech talent within the company, bringing lots of thousands of engineers in-house, bringing more of the tech investment inside the company as opposed to reliance on vendors, so many of them industrywide who are old school legacy vendors and quite expensive. Is that \u2013 at that it's involving \u2013 involved transforming how we build software. It's involved going to the cloud, it's involved transforming our data ecosystem. It's involved modernizing all of the applications on which the company is built. So there's been a lot to this journey and we're a decade into it. The benefits are all around us and it really starts in many ways with benefits in the tech business itself, where our technology teams are moving faster, getting products to market sooner. And our software engineers are just way more modern tech stack to work with and automated software delivery methods and can also to your cloud point benefit by the tremendous, not just, well, the tremendous and continuing innovations that are happening on the cloud. Our customer experiences to continue to get more and more just better and better. And some of the \u2013 we notice it in net promoter scores and occasional awards that Capital One wins. The new products we've been able to innovate things like Capital One Shopping, virtual cards, dealer navigator, instant issuance. Many things have been very benefited there. I mentioned earlier the ability to get some transformational improvements on underwriting, fraud management, and a lot of things behind the scenes that leverage the power of big data and machine learning in real time. That has been very beneficial. Our transformation also is changing how we work inside Capital One, our new marketing platforms. Part of the reason that we're investing more these days in marketing is really the power of mass customized machine learning driven marketing. So that's \u2013 it's been a good thing. And it's also, as I mentioned earlier had a bunch of benefits in terms of enhancing productivity of the business. And the final thing I would say there Don, is that the tech transformation is really helping us get more of the thing we needed to start with to make it happen and that was talent. The biggest elephant in the room for corporate America who sit on legacy tech stacks is you need lots and lots of very modern, best-in-class tech talent in order to drive that transformation in a world where the scarcest, the tightest and most competitive labor market I've seen in the history of building Capital One is the competition for really modern tech talent. The transformation requires so much of that talent. And one of our rewards is now as we get on the other side of the canyon and really have a tech stack build like the very modern tech companies, the ability to attract talent is accelerating. And that's part of a virtuous cycle. That is why we did it, is why we went on this journey, and it's something that we see to this very day, and it's also why we continue to invest more in the opportunities that we see. Bill, I think, your question was, I'm going to put it in different words just to see if I'm saying the same thing. We've got normalization going on right now with an economy that's in some ways, certainly employment wise and some metrics not in a terrible place. And you have normalization \u2013 when normalization meets potentially significant economic worsening coming out of the or maybe catalyzed by the Fed going through their tightening right now. How do we feel about that? Was that your question? I'm going to start doing earnings calls by just asking the questions and then answering them. So \u2013 but look, that is a great question and I think none of us should just be mathematical about normalization. Now, I've talked about how the root word in normalization is normal because what is abnormal is that credit ever got to this once in a lifetime place it did during the pandemic. So as I've said in the \u2013 in absolutely normal times, this thing should normalize. So the way \u2013 so we look at that and say, and expect that should continue. And then we look at the economy and the way that we would always look at that is we've done, many times we've been looking down the gun barrel of a potentially highly uncertain and maybe likely a worse economy. And it's certainly hard to be in the prediction business. But what we do is we \u2013 there's couple of big things that we do as an approach. First of all, we underwrite to an assumption of worsening. We try to make it so if things go bad, it's not a surprise that it would be really bad banking to \u2013 it'd be underwriting to good scenarios. And I know everyone tries to be conservative, but I'm just saying with over three decades in building this company, at the heart of it is underwriting that looks in the rear view mirror of how programs are doing and overlaying a worsening assumption on that because that is could happen, and we need to be resilient to that. So you'll often hear Capital One talking about the word resilient \u2013 resilience. Without a crystal ball about what's going to happen over time, the critical thing is what is the resilience of the loans that we are booking. And we spend a lot of time, for example, in the card business, just looking at the ratio of revenue margin to the charge-off rates and stressing that and all kinds of things. So we underwrite to worsening. That's a very important thing. Secondly, it is the management of credit decisions at the micro level so that we're looking for the earliest indications of where problems can occur. And like I said earlier, that's both \u2013 there's \u2013 let me just give you a little bit of window into that. We, of course, have our way that we look at how all our businesses are doing and all of our vintages are doing. We leverage machine learning though, to also look for aberrations and anomalies that happened faster than they would show up with a report and maybe coming from sources that would not be our standard set of variables by which otherwise, our models would look at the business. And so real-time machine learning-driven monitoring is really important in any environment, but we \u2013 it's really important in an environment like this because we're looking for \u2013 because we expect anomalies to happen, we expect some of our segments to be stressed in even the current environment certainly as things get worse, and so we're on the lookout and we have machine learning to help us. And then as I mentioned earlier, and sorry to be repetitive, but \u2013 but then \u2013 but it's not just letting the machines and the models do the work is standing back and saying, gathering people around and saying, let's think of all the things that could go wrong, what do you think will go wrong and what \u2013 where would weaknesses appear. And then based on that intuition, we go hunting for them. And all of the different approaches have been bearing fruit lately on a more modest basis in the card business and a little bit bigger basis in the auto business. And I would expect as the environment gets a whole lot worse from here, we're going to \u2013 there's going to be a lot of active trimming all over the place. And so it's a combination of literally the most micro and analytical approaches marrying the most intuitive and big picture judgmental approach to managing risk. That is a great question. In fact, let me pull up for a second before I answer your question. We have very gradually across the business, paralleling the move to the top of the market. All across our business, we have been leaning harder into the spender side of the business and just continuing to be most attracted to customers who are there to spend whose patterns would be more consistent with the spending side of the business even as there is a bunch of revolving. So across our business, there has been a very gradual but purposeful migration for years toward the spender side. So I'll put that down there. And then the second thing is the avoidance of high-balance revolvers. And then thirdly, the thing you're pointing to the \u2013 importantly, increasing mix of heavy spenders in our business. That the impact, I think when a downturn comes, these things that we've been leading into and things we've been avoiding should be all other things equal beneficial to the performance of the business in terms of the credit losses themselves, the payment rates that we experienced there during the business. And part of why we have leaned into spenders more is just because all the evidence that we have seen is that it tends to just be pound for pound a more resilient group. So while it's not a controlled experiment, I think the net effect of these changes will be beneficial to the credit results. And I think, enhance the resilience of the business that we have booked. Yes, Dominick. Dominick, that's a great question. I can only sort of speculate here, but the most striking thing about the global financial crisis and Great Recession that \u2013 from a payment hierarchy point of view is what we saw with people literally walking away from their mortgages and what was really high on the payment hierarchy was auto loans. And we \u2013 and that may be a kind of a more universal resilience point on the auto side because people still have to drive to work. And so that's probably more of a sustaining insight. I think that the, we got to look at student loans and think about where \u2013 I think we've already observed that's pretty low in the payment hierarchy and trends these days and forgiveness and various things there would probably ensure that's on the lower end. Another one that I would probably just speculate to add to the hierarchy this year is this time around is fintechs. And I think the fintechs who don't report to the credit bureaus may have enjoyed their stealth opportunity to grow, but that's probably not lost on the consumers. And so I think one of the reasons, we've really leaned harder into having spending be the anchor part of a consumer credit card relationship is that it's not only a healthier place to be from the consumer point of view. But I think, counting on that credit card and making sure that you've got that in a downturn, that helps from a payment hierarchy point of view. Thank you, Dominick. These are all great questions. We \u2013 in case you haven't noticed, I have a pretty deep conviction about the benefit of these tech investments, and that's not just how I feel, that's how all of us collectively feel here at Capital One. And the benefits of that tech investment are so comprehensive, although the company inside this company, we can see them everywhere. And they do so enhance how we work, the ability to manage risk, the ability to serve customers, the ability to create new products, the ability to grow. And so we do \u2013 and because we see such benefits, we are continuing to lean into tech investments. And as I mentioned earlier, there's sort of under the surface quite a bit of productivity gain coming from the tech investment. But on the other hand, at the same time, we're leaning in pretty hard into tech investments such that it's \u2013 the effects are not that dramatic. In fact, over close to a decade, there's been a more gradual kind of improvement in operating efficiency. We \u2013 there's always the opportunity if times get really tough to pull back on tech investments, but we are not viewing these like luxury investments and just what to do on a sunny day because they are very materially transforming the opportunities of this company and the ability to manage risk and the ability to weather the very downturn that might motivate that reduction in investment."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.7 billion or $4.20 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 5%, largely driven by growth across our Domestic Card and Commercial businesses. In the linked quarter, revenue increased 7%, largely driven by growth in net interest income. The loan growth I just described and NIM expansion, both contributed to the increase in net interest income. I will touch on the NIM more in a moment. Non-interest expense grew 8% in the quarter, driven by an increase in operating expenses. Higher headcount and the associated compensation costs were the single biggest driver of the linked quarter increase. In addition to compensation expenses, the collective impact of a number of smaller items also drove up Q3 expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.7 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $931 million and a $734 million allowance build. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $734 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to $12.2 billion as of September 30. Our total company coverage ratio increased 14 basis points to 4.02%. Turning to Slide 5. I'll discuss the allowance and coverage across each of our business segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio increased modestly in each of our segments. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased $530 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.9%. The $6 billion of loan growth in the quarter drove the majority of the allowance build. The impact of continued normalization and a modestly worse corporate economic outlook were partially offset by the release of a portion of our qualitative factors linked to uncertainty in the economy. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $61 million, driving a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 2.6%. The modestly worse corporate economic outlook I just mentioned and expectations of credit normalization drove the allowance builds. And finally, the allowance increased by $107 million in our Commercial business resulting in a 9 basis point increase in coverage to 1.45%. A combination of the modestly worsening corporate economic outlook, an uptick in criticized loans and loan growth drove the allowance build. Turning to Page 6, I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves were roughly flat at about $93 billion as our liquidity reserves have largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Our securities portfolio declined by about $8 billion, driven by a combination of the decline in market value from rising rates and the continued planned runoff of the outsized portfolio we built during the pandemic. The decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily offset by higher cash and cash equivalents. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $7 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter and up 7% from last quarter. Our net interest margin was 6.8% in the third quarter, 45 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 26 basis points higher than last quarter. The 26 basis points linked quarter increase in NIM was driven roughly equally by three factors: first, an extra day to recognize income in the quarter; second, a continued balance sheet shift towards card away from lower-yielding assets; and third, the net benefit of the higher yield of assets relative to higher funding costs. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our preliminary common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% at the end of the third quarter, up about 10 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.7 billion of net income in the quarter was mostly offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and a little over $300 million in share repurchases. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure, Ryan. Recall, it's probably helpful to start with a little bit of history here. And you'll recall, our NIM was compressed during the pandemic, largely driven by a balance sheet that was skewed much more towards cash and securities than card loans. And as we progressed over the course of the pandemic, you saw that begin to normalize. And so just by way of evidence, a year ago, our NIM was, I think, 6.35%. I had said in my prepared remarks. And at that point, card was closer to 27%. I think of our interest-earning assets and cash and securities was something like 33%. Cards now shifted to be just over 30% and cash and securities are down to 27%. So I share that to say we're now operating much closer to our pre-pandemic balance sheet mix. And our NIM is roughly in a similar spot to where it was before the pandemic. So to your question then about rate risk, you can see in our Q, our rate risk disclosures, we're really only slightly asset sensitive at this point. And keep in mind that's relative to forwards. So the 150 basis point projected moves over the next couple of months are already sort of embedded in that neutral baseline. And so as I think about the future, there's a number of things that can impact NIM, not to mention seasonality, but the credit impacts on revenue, competitive pressure on loan margins and deposit pricing. But as we sit here today, I think a lot of the things that we pointed to in the past in terms of balance sheet mix at least have largely run their course. So hopefully, this gives you some sense of the primary forces that play with NIM. Okay. I'll take, I think, what I heard is the first two questions there, Betsy, in NIM and funding, and then I'll turn it over to Rich to talk about buyback. So on the NIM side and the asset portion of that, I just want to clarify what will drive it from here. I do think if you look back historically, cash and securities were roughly 25% of our balance sheet. We're a little bit above that. But given our needs for liquidity and how we use the investment portfolio, I would think that something in that 25% range of the size of the balance sheet is a reasonable assumption for that. Then on the loan side, it really becomes a matter of just marketplace dynamics, what we see as opportunities for growth. And so whether card is growing more quickly than, say, auto or commercial, its percentage of the rest of the balance sheet could drift up. But I don't want to give any indication of how we think that's playing out, and there's certainly not a target that we have in terms of the asset side of the balance sheet. On the funding side, we aim to have a diversified mix of funding that's largely skewed to retail deposits, which, again, historically has been something, I think, around 70% of our overall funding, and we have commercial deposits and brokered CDs and then securitization and wholesale funding \u2013 other sources of wholesale funding. And so again, I would say if you look back to pre-pandemic levels over history compared to where we are today, we're kind of back in a relatively similar place there. So I think I heard in your question, not just mix, but how do we fund growth from here in making marginal decisions for funding incremental loan growth. We're going to weigh a variety of factors, our customers' appetite for different deposit products and our ability to build customer relationships with them, the economics of different funding instruments, the duration of funding or liquidity needs. So we're going to throw all of that into our decision-making process to figure out how to fund. But I also think it's important to think about those funding choices at the margin. It's not just about the liability side. We also have asset growth choices at the margin, too. So we're just going to look at the total integrated economics of both sides of the balance sheet to make those choices. And I'll hand it over to Rich to talk about buybacks. Moshe, let me take the first part of that, and then I'll hand it over to Rich in terms of asset sensitivity. You can see last quarter's Q, and I would expect it will be a fairly similar number this quarter, an up 100 basis point shock. Last quarter was 70 basis point impact to 12-month NII, which is something like a couple of $100 million of NII. And again, that's a shock relative to forwards. So, I just want to clarify that when you talk about us being asset sensitive, we've already baked into our baseline the anticipated, call it, 150 basis points of additional Fed moves over the next couple of quarters. So achieving what I just described suggests the shock beyond that. But I think you should walk around with at this point, we are pretty neutral from an asset sensitivity. So, I just wanted to clarify that before Rich provides the broader answer. Sure, Rick. Well, let me just start by talking about the inputs to the allowance. I just think it's important to sort of ground on the mechanics, the entirety of the mechanics, not just the piece that you called out. So, the first factor of course is just the size of the balance sheet. The second is really aligned to what you were just talking about, but it's kind of a combination of factors, and that is really our outlook for future losses, net of recoveries against that balance sheet. So that starts from a place of looking at what is in the delinquency buckets today, which gives us a really good view of how the next, say six months or so of losses are going to play out. And then after that period, we have an assumption of continued normalization from those unusually strong levels. And then beyond that horizon, as I think, under CECL, there's just an assumption of a gradual revision to historical averages. And then the third point is we apply qualitative factors against all of those expectations to account for uncertainties around economic downsides and inflation related risks. And so when we think about the allowance going forward, yes, I mean, today's allowance of course does incorporate in what is in the delinquency bucket today and what that implies. But as we go forward, the allowance is really going to primarily be determined by just the growth in the balance sheet. And we saw that impact the allowance this quarter. But then secondly, every quarter we continue to normalize, we are going to be replacing lower loss content of the current quarter with higher loss content of future quarters, which again, will be informed by how the delinquencies are playing through each successive quarter. So there's a number of other modest considerations, but that's really the two big forces at play. And hopefully that gets to kind of the nature of your question. Well, you're going to follow along that path because then when we get to a quarter from now, we're going to apply all of those same factors to the allowance at a quarter from now. And the change in the allowance is just going to be the quantum of allowance we have today compared to the quantum of allowance that we would have doing those exact same things a quarter from now. Why don't I take the first one, and I must admit, I'm not quite sure I followed the second. So I'll see if Rich followed that. Otherwise we'll come back to you for clarification. But in terms of unemployment, I'm not going to provide specific metrics or economic assumptions. I will say though, Bill, we are generally consumers of like industry forecast as opposed to developing our own. So I think you could look at general consensus expectations for all of the key economic variables and assume that kind of roughly approximates what underlies our economic views on those variables. And I'm looking at Rich to see if he followed the second part of your question. Ironically, I think they may be \u2013 make things a little less flexible to \u2013 on the expense side, let me explain that. An increasing part of our cost structure as a company is our \u2013is the tech business that we have built. It's got a lot of fixed cost to it. And so that is not \u2013 I wouldn't want to set an expectation that our sort of tech stack and our tech company that we have built is a more variable cost business because if anything, it might be a little more fixed cost business. Now there within that, choices on what we invest in and the timing of those always create flexibility. And in stressful times, they're certainly on the investment side within tech can be more flexibility there. But the tech investment though pulling way up has tremendously enhanced Capital One's overall flexibility. Our ability to turn quickly in the marketplace to make credit choices. If you look back to the \u2013 when we all went \u2013 when the world went into vertical free fall of uncertainty in the pandemic, just look back at how quickly Capital One turned with respect to some of the pullbacks we did, that would not have been possible in the more legacy world that we lived in before. So the ability to respond quickly, the ability to create changes in the offerings to consumers the ability to create \u2013 we have flexibility and offerings, flexibility and forbearance, new ways to adapt to the marketplace. Everything about Capital One, the speed of change of managed change is dramatically different from before. We also \u2013 and this is probably the most important recession resilience point is the monitoring point I made earlier, to have put in place a much more comprehensive real-time monitoring capability with root cause analysis that's much more comprehensive than what we could have done before will allow us to be informed earlier on about things that are happening. And I do want to say I've been asked by a number of investors. Rich, we know you well enough to know how cautious you are about the economy and about downturns and the utmost respect for what \u2013 how risk can play out in these businesses, why are you leaning into the marketing opportunity? And one of the reasons that we're doing that is this substantially improved measurement, monitoring and speed of response and the level of segmentation and micro segmentation by which we can do that gives us \u2013 allows the sort of paradoxical thing to lean in more than we otherwise might have been able to do. Yes."

Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Danielle, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $2 billion or $4.96 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans held for investment grew 6% and average loans grew 4%, driven by growth across all of our segments. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% or 3% after accounting for the $192 million gain on sale recognized in the prior quarter. Non-interest expense grew 1% in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion driven mostly by net charge-offs of $845 million and a $200 million allowance build. Turning to slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $200 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up 2% to $11.5 billion as of June 30th. Our total company coverage ratio decreased 15 basis points to 3.88%. The changes in allowance and coverage ratio varied by segment, which I'll cover on slide five. Across all our businesses, loan growth and a worsening economic outlook drove upward pressure on allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $145 million. The coverage in Consumer Banking increased 14 basis points to 2.51%. In our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $152 million. The coverage in Commercial Banking increased five basis points and now stands at 1.36%. In addition to the allowance build, there was also $39 million of provision related to unfunded lending commitments. In our Domestic Card business, we released $128 million of allowance despite the effects of the growth and worsening economic outlook I previously mentioned. We have seen some signs of gradual normalization in our card credit metrics. But so far, the pace of that normalization has been slower than what we assumed when we set last quarter's allowance. The impact of this slower-than-assumed normalization more than offset the growth and worsening economic outlook, leading to the allowance release. We continue to carry elevated levels of qualitative reserves for downside risks related to economic uncertainty. The coverage ratio for Domestic Card now stands at 6.82%. Turning to page six. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 144%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves declined $17 billion in the quarter as our liquidity normalizes towards pre-pandemic levels. Cash and cash equivalents declined about $5 billion and now stands at $22 billion. We also had a $6 billion decline in our securities portfolio driven by the combination of the mark from rising interest rates and the continued runoff of the outsized portfolio built during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $6.5 billion, up 13% from the year ago quarter and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.54%, 65 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and five basis points higher than the prior quarter. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we continue to deploy excess cash and securities into loan growth. The linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by an additional day to recognize revenue. Higher yields on assets in the quarter were offset by higher wholesale funding and deposit costs. Outside of quarterly day count, our NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, the impacts of interest rates beyond forwards, wholesale funding costs, and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.1% at the end of the second quarter, down about 60 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our long-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the quarter, the pace of our repurchases slowed to about $2 billion. The pace of any future repurchases will be driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, growth, economic conditions and market dynamics. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with second quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic card results which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in every top line metrics. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 18% year-over-year and up 48% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $19.7 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 6% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to gradually normalize, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.26%, a 2 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.35%, 67 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 14 basis points, roughly in line with normal seasonal patterns. The delinquency rate was up 3 basis points from the linked quarter, which we -- when we typically see modest seasonal improvement. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the second quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1 billion in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but not the only driver of total company marketing trends. The primary non-card driver of increased marketing is in our Consumer Banking business, where we're marketing to drive deposit growth and build customer franchise in our digital-first national banking strategy. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns. And we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build a franchise across our Domestic Card businesses. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risk. And as always, we underwrite to a worsening scenario, even as we lean into marketing. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And we continue to gain traction in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders. In the second quarter, heavy spender marketing includes increased early spend bonuses driven by strong first quarter account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. As a result of our marketing, we posted strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with new and existing customers. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Pulling up, our heavy spender franchise has a different economic mix than some of our other card businesses. It has significantly higher upfront costs of brand building, marketing and promotions and investments in high-end experiences. However, the long-term economics are compelling. And as our heavy spender franchise has grown significantly in recent years, its impact has quietly and gradually changed several Domestic Card metrics and financial results. Heavy spender credit losses are low, which lowers overall Domestic Card loss rates, all other things being equal. Naturally high heavy spender payment behaviors are a key driver of our long-term trend of increasing domestic card payment rates, and high payment rates go hand-in-hand with strong credit performance. Heavy spender attrition is very low, and that's been a factor in our strong Domestic Card loan growth. Heavy spenders have a particularly large impact on increasing purchase volume and have been a major driver of strong Domestic Card purchase volume growth that has generally exceeded loan growth over time. This spend velocity has driven increases in net interchange revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue. And these interchange fee revenues -- revenue annuities are strong and sustained over very long-term customer relationships. Our heavy spender franchise generates financial results that are attractive, less volatile and very resilient. As a result, the heavy spender business requires less capital and delivers strong long-term returns on capital. Pulling way up, our 10-year quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing, but the sustained revenue, credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they're growing. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, choices we made in our auto business impacted several Consumer Banking trends. We pulled back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. As you'd expect, many auto lenders have raised pricing as rising interest rates drove higher marginal funding costs, but some others have kept pricing relatively flat. These competitors have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 20% year-over-year and 12% from the linked quarter. As we pulled back on originations, the year-over-year growth of ending loans in the Consumer Banking business decelerated to 9% in the second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1%. Second quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year, aided in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits from our commercial bank. Consumer Banking deposits declined 1% from the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter as growth in auto loans was offset by the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees and the year-over-year decline in auto margins.  Auto margin compression was primarily driven by the increase in our marginal funding costs, resulting from rapid interest rate increases and the aggressive competitor pricing that, I just discussed. Noninterest expense was up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by the increased marketing for our digital national bank and continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses. Second quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $306 million in the second quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $281 million. We added to the allowance for credit losses in our auto business in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continue to gradually normalize, but we remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  The charge-off rate for the second quarter was 0.61%, up 73 basis points from the unsustainably low, in fact, negative quarterly charge-off rate a year ago. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47%, up 121 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 5 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 62 basis points. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans and revenue in the quarter. Second quarter ending loan balances were up 9% from the sequential quarter. Average loans increased 5%. Growth in selected industry specialties drove our growth.  Ending deposits were down 14% from the first quarter and down 10% year-over-year, driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that I mentioned a few moments ago, as well as rate-driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns. In the second quarter, deposit balances were also impacted by seasonal outflows.  Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter and 26% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was down modestly from the linked quarter and up 16% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses increased $214 million from the first quarter, largely driven by a build in the allowance for credit losses. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the second quarter.  The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 14 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.3%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.7%. In closing, we continued to drive good growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. Consumer Banking loan growth continued, albeit at a slower pace. And our Commercial Banking business posted strong growth in loans and revenue.  Credit results remain across our businesses, with charge-off rates and delinquency rates well below pre-pandemic levels even as credit continues to gradually normalize. And we continued to return capital to our shareholders. For more than three decades, we have hardwired resilience into every underwriting and growth choice we make in good times and bad. And we've steadfastly focused on building an enduring franchise. Sticking to these core tenets, we've demonstrated resilience through several cycles. We've been in a strong position to seize opportunities as markets evolve and as cycles played out. And we've delivered significant value over the long-term. And we're living by these same core tenets today. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities long after the normalization trends and cyclical credit pressures play out. We're confident in the choices we're making. As we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and increasing economic uncertainty, our credit results remain strong. We're staying focused on the most resilient businesses and sub-segments. And we're continuing to hone the proprietary underwriting and product structures that have driven our resilience through prior cycles. All of these growth in credit risk management choices are enhanced by our technology transformation. We're managing costs tightly even as we continue to invest in transforming our technology and digital capabilities that are the engine of future growth and efficiency. While the imperatives and marketplace opportunities and risks impact the timing, we remain focused on delivering operating leverage over the long-term powered by growth and digital productivity gains. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a strong position to weather a broad range of possible economic scenarios and to emerge in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities that are often generated as cycles play out. Pulling way up, we believe that our long-standing core tenets and the choices they drive today are putting us in a strong position to continue to deliver resilience and compelling long-term shareholder value as the sweeping digital transformation of banking continues. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Danielle?\nDanielle Dietz: Thanks, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Melinda, please start the Q&A session. \nOperator: Thank you.  And we'll go first to Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey good evening everyone.\nRichard Fairbank: Good evening Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Rich, maybe just to start off on marketing, which was up again sequentially. Have we seen the peak impacts of the early bonuses? And maybe just more broadly, are you guys still leaning in? And maybe you could just talk about the decision in the context of where we are in the economy with inflation? And maybe are you pulling back in any pockets just given what's going on across the customer base?\nRichard Fairbank: Ryan, we -- on the early bonuses, I mean, that's really tied to how hard we lean into Venture X, for example. I mean we have early spend bonuses pretty much across our rewards business. So, let me separate a little bit. So, we have the launch of Venture X, and some companies launches are sort of a quarter long kind of thing. We continue to lean into that. You've seen our national advertising continue on that. So, the early spend bonuses continue as part of that and then also their early spend bonuses at a stable rate for the -- some of our other rewards products as well. With respect to the economy, we -- it's not lost on us that there's a lot of noise out there in the economy. And we -- every day, we talk about this and there's always uncertainty. There's probably, I think, more uncertainty at the moment and probably on average, and that's not lost on us. We -- so we don't make a top-of-the-house decision that says we're going to spend this much on marketing because these decisions are very -- decisions at the margin based on models and estimated loss rates and putting resilience factors in there and response rates and a lot of things. There has been some trimming around the edges in card quite a bit more so in auto, by the way, as I talked about just a few minutes ago. But staying with card for a minute, there has been some trimming around the edges. But generally, the kind of core target segments that we've been going after, we are continuing to feel good about and lean into. So, I think your net impression should be that while we have a very watchful eye on the economy and obsess about it every day, our underwriting decisions underwrite systematically. At Capital One, we underwrite to a worsening scenario. And so we feel good about our originations. And -- but one thing about our tech transformation that has really been good also is it allows us to move and adapt much more quickly. In most -- in companies and frankly, in some of our past years, when we decided to turn, it sometimes took quite a bit of time to move the whole machine. We've been able to create a much more adaptive and responsive infrastructure at Capital One. And so that's also helpful in a time of uncertainty. But net-net, we feel good about the opportunities, and we're leaning into them.\nDanielle Dietz: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Thank you very much. Could you further discuss some of the things that you're seeing on the auto sector just given where it's been throughout 2021 where we saw really good performance? And then now it just seems like the combination of rising delinquency rates, unresponsive yields and just some softening in used car prices are really impacted. Can you just give us an outlook on what your expectations are and how Capital One going to react through this year and potentially in a recessionary environment in 2023? Thank you.\nDanielle Dietz: Rich, I think you need to unmute yourself.\nRichard Fairbank: Sorry, sorry. Kevin, thank you. The auto business is one that -- I mean, we're still -- we still see significant opportunity in the auto business. But, of course, what we always share with investors is how we're feeling at the moment and at the margin. So the biggest at the moment thing that we wanted to share with you is how the competitive environment feels. And we've been saying for some time that the low charge-offs, we worry that too long of a period of low charge-offs and too long of a period of, in many ways, unsustainably high used car prices can dull the senses of players in the auto industry and cause a weakening in underwriting. We haven't really seen -- that's not the primary story that we see. We certainly are on the lookout for that. The story has really been more hijacked, if you will, by what's happened with inflation and the significant increase in -- for companies and in cost of funds. And most auto players, and certainly, the money center, in particular, have moved up their pricing very consistently and responsibly to the increases in the underlying cost of funds in the economy. And what is striking is that, some competition has not. There are a few large players whose movement is -- in pricing is well behind that. And then you have the credit unions who have, I think, a very different kind of business model and a different way to calculate what their funding cost is. The credit unions have really not moved at all in terms of their pricing, and they've had actually a very significant increase in market share. So we are -- we continue to be very dedicated to the auto business. We have relationships with dealers. We're not -- this is not like a huge pullback, but what we're doing at the margin is, with the tighter margins that now at least temporarily exist in the business, for us, that has led us to trim around the edges. That's, I think, the biggest story that we would say in auto. The other thing is used car pricing. Let's talk just a little bit about that, Kevin. Vehicle values remain strikingly high and obviously well above pre-pandemic levels. And supply constraints remain the biggest factors supporting high vehicle values. And everything that we see suggests vehicle production will remain constrained in the near-term. And even when production normalizes, I think it will take time for dealers to rebuild their inventories. So probably the near-term outlook is pretty good with respect to used car values. But if I pull up a concern that I've often voiced is that from an underwriting point of view, what really matters is not the absolute level of collateral values, but the relative value of collateral values versus the underwriting assumptions that a lender made. And so we assume significant declines in collateral values in our underwriting, but we have a watchful eye on an industry that for quite some time now has been hopefully not getting used to the used car prices that are at relatively -- are at record levels versus anything we've seen in the past. So I think the auto opportunity continues to be a significant one for Capital One, but particularly driven by pricing, which may, by the way, ameliorate for certainly everyone except the credit unions in a relatively short period of time. But until then, we will continue to be pretty tight around the edges, and we wanted to share that with you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Rich, Capital One has long been known for its rich information-based analytics. How are you thinking about the risk that the strength we're seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the Fed to have to do more? And since the impact of Fed hikes tends to be lagged, unemployment tends to continue to increase well after peak Fed funds, maybe can you talk a little bit about how this dynamic feeds into costs, underwriting and reserving models?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. So -- well, thanks. Let's just kind of pull up and talk about inflation. We haven't seen sustained inflation in the US in many decades, but it's been running above 5% for over a year now, and it reached, I think, 9.1% in June. And producer prices are increasing even faster. And of course, the Fed has started raising rates in response, and the market expects further increases. So what I want to do is maybe list some of the potential impacts to our business of sustained inflation, and it's mostly negative. So if the economy suffers as a result of efforts to slow inflation, we will certainly feel that. And the biggest way that we would feel that would be in consumer credit losses. Consumers also were already starting to feel the impact of price inflation outpacing wage growth. Also in our lending business, higher cost of funds could put pressure on our margins, especially if lenders don't adjust pricing in response.  And we're already seeing that in the auto business. By the way, in the card business, just as a comparison, I've been struck by generally the responsiveness of the pricing in the card business to be responsively adaptive to interest rates. I mean it's a variable rate product, but also just in terms of offered rate by competitors, that seems to have moved much more dynamically than what we've seen selectively in auto.  Then other things about the impact of interest rate increases, let me think. We've got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can sometimes see lower demand for credit products just because headline pricing seems higher even if real pricing isn't. And in our underwriting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, let me just say one thing, and you put your finger on it. Well, a striking thing right now is, how low the unemployment rate is. And we have certainly seen in our modeling of credit over all the decades, we've been doing this at Capital One.  From a macroeconomic point of view, the biggest direct driver of credit losses is unemployment. And so, we start in a very strong position now. But to your point, there's irony in the strength of this position, and it could contribute to some of the affects you identified.  I do want to also just -- while we're on the subject of inflation, though, just highlight a few favorable effects of inflation as well. Existing debt levels will decrease in real terms in a period of sustained inflation. High vehicle values, which support auto credit, may be more sustainable in a high inflation environment. But in total, I think the effects tilt definitely in the negative direction.  So, it's a tough thing to model collectively all these things, but what we do is we start with sort of a general theory of how this stuff works. We try to incorporate it into the decision-making that we do. And then like a hawk, we look for these various effects to happen and are prepared to be responsive.  And in fact, just the one last thing I want to say is, I've always felt that it's very hard to predict economic cycles. I don't think Capital One is in a better position than anyone else to predict economic cycles. Sometimes you've seen us weigh in, in predicting credit cycles, which can be correlated, but not the same thing as that. But the most important thing that -- what I take away from years of doing this is, it's very hard to predict these cycles.  The key thing is to underwrite to a resilience level to make it very successfully through cycles, and that's been a cornerstone of our strategy, actually since the founding day of Capital One.\nBill Carcache: Yes, super helpful Rich. Thank you for taking my question. I will let others jump in. thanks.\nDanielle Dietz: Great. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Rich, when I sort of piece together everything that I'm hearing and looking at the numbers, if we particularly focus on the growth and the reserve movements at the consumer lending business, the Credit Card business and the commercial lending business, it kind of feels like you are diverging in your outlook in terms of the Credit Card business outperforming the other businesses likely from a cost perspective. Is that because of competitive pressures, or is there something in line that you're seeing that would cause that divergence?\nRichard Fairbank: So Rick, I don't know if we explicitly run around with a -- I wouldn't say our view is that stark as you say it, but I think that we certainly feel the most bullish about the card business. Let's talk about why for a second. First of all, just as the business and with the business model Capital One has, with the resilience it's shown through several downturns now and the power of leveraging data and analytics and mass customization to that business, I think that we feel particularly high level of resilience in that business, and that has been demonstrated in the past. And if anything, I think the technology transformation and some of the continued choices we've made like dialing back from high balance revolvers and other things has -- and as I said, the whole heavy spender push, I think, has put Capital One and actually an even stronger position from a resilience point of view. Also in terms of what we see going on with the -- in the business, there is normalization, but it is really quite gradual. By the way, the normalization is gradual across all of our businesses. But the -- but I want to point out just a bit of a math point in auto, for example. Auto is normalizing gradually, so is card, but -- and the front book with respect to auto and card, which are both normalizing faster than the back book, by the way, I've seen that universally, whenever there's normalization, one always sees it more in the front book than in seasoned back books. But if you think about auto as an average life of like two years, and Credit Card last much longer than that. And so as there's front book normalization, the replacement speed in the portfolio in auto is much faster than in card. So even for the same amount of normalization in those two businesses, in, say, the front book, you're going to get just mathematically faster normalization in auto. So it is our expectation. It would be surprising to us if that weren't the case, more just because of the math of replacement of a more rapidly turning over portfolio. So, we certainly -- card is the business we're most bullish about is the one that we're leaning hardest into. And you'll notice our story here. We're not -- our story is not a universal one that says I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but we feel great about growth. So, we're leaning into it everywhere. You can see an example of what you've seen over the years of how Capital One works. Everything is choices that is made at the margin locally, I mean, in various businesses. And the fact that in auto, we're pulling back significantly as we've talked about while leaning pretty hard in the card and certain parts of commercial is a window into that very phenomenon. Rick, thank you very much.\nRick Shane: Thank you.\nDanielle Dietz: Rick, did you have a follow-up question? Okay, we'll go to the next question, please, Melinda.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. A question for Andrew. Could you just talk about how you see the NIM progressing from here? Obviously, the rate outlook suggests more rates than last quarter. Maybe just talk about how you're seeing deposit betas progress and sort of how that plays through the NIM?\nAndrew Young: Sure, Sanjay. Why don't I start with beta and just give a little bit of detail there and then feather it into the broader NIM question you asked. And so when you look at our deposits, roughly 15% are a combination of commercial and brokered, which have higher betas, but really the 800-pound gorilla is the -- something like 85% of the deposits that are in retail. So, I'll focus mostly there. And I think looking back on history as a guide is a bit of a challenge in this cycle. So we've already seen 150 bps of move in the first six months. We're expecting another 200 or so over the next. And in the last rising cycle, it took three and a half years to just get to 200 in that first year. We moved 50 in total versus the 350 we might see this year. And so I share that context to say the faster and larger set of moves, coupled with quantitative tightening and the possibility of some competitors being a bit more aggressive to fund their loan growth, all will play into how competitors behave and the overall level of deposits. And so if I look at the last rising cycle, we were at something like 40%. And the last falling cycle, we were around 50. But given the factors that I described a moment ago, it's hard to really pinpoint exactly what's going to transpire looking ahead, but I would think our cumulative beta could be around or slightly above the last rising cycle. And so in line with what you've seen historically, beta moves pretty slowly in the beginning to the first set of hikes. And so this quarter, you saw that we were high single-digits, but the planned rate hikes for the second half of the year are likely going to pressure that beta up. And so, when I take that and factor it into our NIM outside, obviously, of the quarterly day count effects, the tailwinds to our NIM are going to be the asset mix moving towards higher yielding assets like card. And what we saw in this quarter, by the way, ending card loans grew faster than average, so the more that card is growing relative to other asset classes and the cash and investment portfolio and then just the broader asset yield increases from the higher interest rates. Those are things that are going to be tailwinds. The headwinds are going to be the deposit costs, not only from the rising deposit betas that I just described, but also wholesale funding costs to the extent that we do more of that and depending on credit spreads in the marketplace. But there isn't one dominant force in those factors from where we stand today. So I think they're all going to be pushing against one another and we're going to see where that nets out in the coming quarters.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Just a follow-up question for Rich. Obviously, there's been a massive dislocation in the fintech space from a valuation standpoint. I'm curious if you think that presents opportunities for M&A for Capital One. Thanks.\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Richard Fairbank: Thanks, Sanjay. Capital One, we've said for a number of years that unlike most banks, we're not on a quest to go buy other banks and build our national banking franchise that way. So -- and that really where we would do acquisitions, it would really be of -- either basically of tech companies themselves that bring a tech capability or fintechs that bring a tech-based capability right in our business sweet spot. So we have -- for that reason, plus our great interest in learning from fintechs, we have been very keen observers of that marketplace. We -- you haven't seen much in the way of acquisitions from Capital One, because of the breathtaking pricing that fintechs have had. But certainly, to your point, as the pricing has crashed in that marketplace, we continue to watch the market carefully. And our strategy remains the same that we believe that Capital One is kind of an ideal buyer for fintechs, because we have a modern tech stack and we built a company that feels very much like a tech company and I think is very well suited to acquire and assimilate and provide opportunity to the talent that comes in a tech acquisition. So that's sort of the principle behind it. So we continue to look in the marketplace, and that's the primary acquisition interest that Capital One has, which is kind of different from, I think, most banking institutions.\nDanielle Dietz: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hi. Rich, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about where you see more downside surprise risk on the credit spectrum. Is it the lower end consumer, or is it the affluent heavy spender? And I guess on the low end, can consumers really weather the strong inflation, in particular, unemployment softens a little bit?\nRichard Fairbank: So Don, thank you for that. Let's start by just talking about the consumer. Certainly, I'm certainly struck by the starting point of where the consumer is because the US consumer remains quite healthy. We see sustained improvements in consumer balance sheets coming out of the pandemic. Let's see. Debt servicing burdens remain near like mutli decade lows. The savings rate has dipped below pre-pandemic levels over the past few months, but cumulative savings over the last two years remain a significant positive still for consumers on average. We see higher bank account balances and higher household net worth across the income spectrum. Labor market demand remains exceptionally strong with record numbers of job openings and solid wage growth. And in our own portfolio, we see continuing strength in our delinquency roll rates and recovery rates. Despite times of credit normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any standard -- any historical standards. So that is the context that we see. But to your point, the big headwinds for consumers are price inflation and higher interest rates. And inflation could erode the excess savings consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth. Higher interest rates could push up debt servicing burdens, although this effect is muted by the fact that most existing household debt is in fixed rate mortgages and auto loans. So I'm struck by, though, the strong starting point for consumers as we look into the potential -- the headwinds of inflation and more economic trouble. And I would contrast this, of course, to the Great Recession or the global financial crisis, which -- where the consumer was in a much weaker position going into that. Now the strength of the consumer is pretty much across the board -- across the -- from the top of the market into sub-prime. And so I think the thing most striking is how sort of universal it is. But it is also the case that normalization is a bit more pronounced in sub-prime than it is higher in the market. But these \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these populations, though, Also more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So, I think these trends shouldn't be surprising. So, I think certainly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now FICO score and income are not the same thing. But a lot of times, people tend to state them in the same breadth. Our subprime business is definitionally about people with FICO scores below a certain level.  But I think that the consumer starts in a strong place, then we should probably expect normalization to be a little faster on the lower end. And interestingly, if you switch to kind of income, which is a different cut than FICO certainly, and income, I'm struck by the fact that consumers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the wage growth for the lower income consumers is -- they're kind of the one category, the lower income consumers, where their wage growth has been keeping up with inflation, but that won't necessarily continue, but that's also a position of strength. But pulling way up, I think we could see normalization a little faster in subprime. I think, in fact, we already can see very modestly that effect. But of course, in our underwriting and the whole business model of Capital One, that's also where we have built in kind of the biggest buffers of resilience. So, we feel good about that part of the marketplace. We feel good really across the credit spectrum and to lean into our marketing opportunity.\nDon Fandetti: Got it. Thank you.\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Danielle Dietz: Great. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Rich, you had mentioned that you saw good kind of increases in prices for new accounts across the spectrum. But at the same time, I guess, rewards and upfront bonuses have also been very high. Can you just talk about how you're seeing the kind of competitive environment, particularly for the higher-end consumer where you're spending a lot of that effort?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So, competition in the rewards space is, I'd say, more intense than pre-pandemic -- a bit more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but largely unchanged in recent quarters. So early spend bonuses in points offers were slightly more aggressive than in the first quarter, and we continue to see certain offers come in and out of market.  Cash, early spend bonuses are higher now than pre-pandemic, but have been relatively stable at these elevated levels since basically mid last year. And then if we look at the baseline rewards earn rates, particularly in the cashback space, they overall were probably more aggressive in the middle of 2021 as new products were being introduced, but it's been relatively calm since. Now we feel great about our flagship products. We continue to be very pleased by consumers' response and engagement with them. We're very pleased with the launch of our Venture X card. But I think if I pull way up, Moshe, one of the things that I so deeply believe and have experienced is that winning in the heavy spender space, I think it requires good products, but you can't win with good products. It takes a lot more than that. And the customer experience, specifically the digital experience, the brand, the -- a lot of experiential things that are way beyond the product are part of the whole package. And what we have said -- this is why we've been saying for years now that winning at the top of the market is not an in and out thing. It is a matter of choosing as a few players have done, Capital One being one of them that, that's where we're going, and we're going to continue to lean into that. And I have been struck by the sustainable success that we have been generating. And also the marketplace, while very intense hasn't tipped over to being unreasonable or irrational. So it's very competitive, but I continue to really like our opportunity in that space.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And maybe just as a follow-up. The yield for the last four quarters in your card business has been pretty flat both the yield on the loans up a little bit this quarter, I guess, with the rate increases that you talked about. But what is it really going to take to get that to be a higher number? Is it -- are you going to see more revolving from some of your high-end consumers? Is it -- what is it going to -- to get that -- the level of revenue growth and profitability enhanced?\nAndrew Young: Hey Moshe, it's Andrew. And I think if you put the card yield in the context of a longer term history, looking a year ago, it's up 100 basis points. And that's really been a shift to a higher mix of assets in our branded book, which is both growth of existing customers and the success we're seeing in the originations that Rich talked about. And as we sit here today and looking over the last few quarters, we're also seeing a modest uptick in fees from the very low levels last year and so driven by the delinquencies that have ticked up very gradually year-over-year. But I think having a yield at these levels is something that has sustained. But to your point of how can we drive it up, I think we're seeing an impact from rate changes that's been a bit of a tailwind on the yield side. But clearly, that comes with a funding cost that ultimately will probably leave margin much closer to flat.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks very much.\nDanielle Dietz: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: Sorry I was on mute. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point. You're talking about the benefits of some of these super prime spenders. And I guess one of the aspects that's, I guess, less challenging or less beneficial is that you're not really revolving or they don't tend to evolve nearly as much because that spend velocity is so high, and they pay down each month. As you think about that customer base growing over time, would that just have a natural kind of downward pressure on your Domestic Card yield?\nAndrew Young: Well, Arren, it depends a bit on the degree to which they're revolving versus just pure transacting. But if they're transacting, they're bringing quite a bit of interchange and relatively low outstandings over time. So, that very well could prove to be a net positive and not create the downward pressure that you just described. And not to mention the fact that in doing so, it creates less of a capital need. And so it ends up being over time at least a pretty capital-efficient business, which is one of the reasons why we've been on this decade-long journey to build that franchise.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay, got it. And then just on the deposit side, you had a modest decline kind of seasonal, I'm assuming that had to do with taxes. You haven't really, to your benefit, I guess, not been a leader in terms of pricing on the online side. Are you seeing kind of quarter-to-date an increase in deposits or do you expect that to be a little bit slower growth as we see the rate hikes increase?\nAndrew Young: Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on what we see so far this quarter. But let's take a step back and think about the industry context and then talk a little bit about our strategy there. As you look at the industry, you brought up, at least in retail, the tax outflow phenomenon that happened in the second quarter, and we certainly felt a little bit of that. But where industry deposit balances go from here, first thing is at least history, whether it repeats itself, would indicate that the rate of deposit growth drops in rising rate environment. And in this particular cycle, the Fed fund rates, as I mentioned to Sanjay's question, are both larger and faster than previous ones, and the Fed shrinking its balance sheet. So who knows? I guess this is good as yours, but I think we could see a scenario where industry-wide deposits are flattish to down in the near-term. And so what we choose to do there is really trying to optimize our balance sheet across a number of different dynamics of liquidity and funding and tenor and pricing. And so we feel like we're in a great position to compete in that industry backdrop with simple straightforward competitive products that have a great user experience. But where our deposits ultimately go from here in the context of that industry will be a function of our deposit needs and competitive dynamics.\nRichard Fairbank: Arren, let me just add that this is -- I want to underscore the strategy that Capital One has had for years now, which is, we are building a national bank through, not by just acquiring branches on every corner across the United States, nor by just having a national digital bank, but really building a, in a sense, full-service digital bank that can provide almost everything that you can get in a local branch to provide it nationally -- excuse me, digitally. And that is part of our strategy to build primary banking relationships that are digital-first and digitally originated. And it's all part of a larger strategy to build a consumer banking franchise that is not about just the highest rate paid, but really about high-quality products, a great customer experience and a full-service set of capabilities where people can -- banking relationship and then also have savings deposits there. And one of the -- one of my comments that I made about our marketing levels, which, everybody notices, are high is, one thing we've continued to invest in over time is, Capital One as a company that doesn't have branches on every corner. We've got branches on some corners, but a greater proportion of our expenditures are on the marketing side, are on the brand building side and, to some extent, on the tech side as well. But it is very much in service of building a franchise of -- a brand and a franchise that enables us to dynamically grow our deposits at very appropriate blended pricing and build long-term loyal banking relationships. And we're very pleased with the success we've had in that, but we continue invest very much in that.\nDanielle Dietz: Next question, please.\nOperator: Moving on to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good evening.\nRichard Fairbank: Good evening, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Andrew, just wanted to double-click on the comments that you're making around the high transaction -- high transactors having lower capital intensity, and that's a function of them just being higher credit quality, shorter duration on the book? Is that basically what it's about, or is there something more there?\nAndrew Young: No. It's really just the loss content of that book, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. Okay. And then when you were going through the deck on the capital slide, I think you mentioned 11% is your CET1 target. And so, given that there is such demand for spend and borrow right now, should we take your comments to mean that it's unlikely that you'll be doing buybacks in the near future while this high loan growth period is upon us?\nAndrew Young: Well, just to repeat a little bit, Betsy, of what I shared in my prepared remarks there's just a number of factors to consider, just our forecasted level of capital and earnings and growth, but we need to put those things in the context with a particular eye to the error bars around those estimates. And so what I was mostly trying to highlight is if you look back a year ago, we were at 14.5% CET1, that's down to 12 1 this quarter. And so we're getting much closer to that 11% level. And at a time when there are a number of uncertainties given the economic environment and the growth opportunities, those error bars just start to matter more. And so we slowed down a bit in the second quarter. But as always is the case, managing capital both conservatively and efficiently is top of mind for us. And so looking ahead, we're just going to dynamically adjust our pace in the context of those evolving factors.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.\nDanielle Dietz: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide us with a breakdown of your -- and remind us of your Domestic Card spending by retail category as a percent of total spend within Domestic Card, so grocery or T&E or gas, whatever you could provide would be excellent. I would just think that as you're targeting the higher spenders, it's probably had an effect on that mix over the last 10 years as that's changed. Any color you could provide would be great. Thanks.\nDanielle Dietz: Rich, you need to unmute, please.\nRichard Fairbank: Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Sorry. I have in front of me -- I don't think it's the exact thing you're asking, but I have in front of me some growth rates, in fact, finishing growth since -- versus 2019 of a bunch of categories that I find pretty fascinating, but this is not -- this isn't our own mix, but these things in fact mix things, I guess, but gas 90%. Now by the way, this is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this includes growth by Capital One overall. There's been significant growth of our whole business. So -- but just some relative comparisons. Travel, 26%, although travel is second to gas, if I look at year-over-year gross, only gas as a category has grown more. So gas is up 54% year-over-year. The travel is up 42% year-over-year, and those are swamping most of the other categories there. But travel was way the laggard during the downturn, and it's been -- like I said, other than \u00e2\u0080\u0093 than energy, it has been the one that is really catching up quickly. So what's striking is just how much these things vary across categories as the consumer reacts to the COVID or energy costs. And also, it'll be interesting to see how much the consumer migrates to whether -- to -- between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. We'll keep a close eye on that one as things get a little tighter in the marketplace.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. Given \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to take some of the conversation one step further around deposits and funding, given the amount of card growth that you're seeing and building out this franchise, but the slowing deposit growth, is it reasonable to assume that as a management team, you would really look to focus on growing this business first, regardless of perhaps the funding cost, trade-off between deposits and non-deposit funding because really, you're just gaining more customers within your card franchise and you would make that trade? Thanks so much.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So first, pulling up, it's not lost on us that our assets are growing rapidly. Right now, all banks are growing more slowly in deposits. So, we -- I think that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean this is a natural thing that happens at this part of the cycle. And so, this is why I made my earlier comments about being very pleased that we have already been leaning into having a deposit franchise and being in a position to build primary banking relationships, to grow savings accounts, to have a brand as a company that will have attractive savings rates, but not to have to go generate all our business off of the bank rate tables kind of marketplace.  So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but with respect to the economics, Dominick, I think the card margins are such that -- it's hard to imagine that we wouldn't continue to make the trade that even if we have to pay more for deposits, we would not turn down the growth opportunity. So long as the deposits are available and they're there, it's going to be a good trade to continue growing that card business as far out as we can see because of the particularly robust economics that come with our card franchise.  But just to finish off that point. I'm sorry. But we also like being in a position as a national bank with a national brand for digital banking that we're in a position to gather the deposits we need in order to fund the kind of growth opportunity that we have at a time when it's going to get harder to grow deposits at this part of the cycle.\nDanielle Dietz: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on this conference call today, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer your questions, if you have any, and have a great evening.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, everybody. Good night.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with second quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin, drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic card results which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in every top line metrics. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 18% year-over-year and up 48% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Ending loan balances increased $19.7 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 6% from the sequential quarter, and revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Strong credit results continued in the quarter. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to gradually normalize, but remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.26%, a 2 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.35%, 67 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 14 basis points, roughly in line with normal seasonal patterns. The delinquency rate was up 3 basis points from the linked quarter, which we -- when we typically see modest seasonal improvement. Non-interest expense was up 28% from the second quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1 billion in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but not the only driver of total company marketing trends. The primary non-card driver of increased marketing is in our Consumer Banking business, where we're marketing to drive deposit growth and build customer franchise in our digital-first national banking strategy. In our Domestic Card business, we continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns. And we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build a franchise across our Domestic Card businesses. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risk. And as always, we underwrite to a worsening scenario, even as we lean into marketing. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume, new accounts and loans across our Domestic Card business. And we continue to gain traction in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders. In the second quarter, heavy spender marketing includes increased early spend bonuses driven by strong first quarter account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges. As a result of our marketing, we posted strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with new and existing customers. We're gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market. Pulling up, our heavy spender franchise has a different economic mix than some of our other card businesses. It has significantly higher upfront costs of brand building, marketing and promotions and investments in high-end experiences. However, the long-term economics are compelling. And as our heavy spender franchise has grown significantly in recent years, its impact has quietly and gradually changed several Domestic Card metrics and financial results. Heavy spender credit losses are low, which lowers overall Domestic Card loss rates, all other things being equal. Naturally high heavy spender payment behaviors are a key driver of our long-term trend of increasing domestic card payment rates, and high payment rates go hand-in-hand with strong credit performance. Heavy spender attrition is very low, and that's been a factor in our strong Domestic Card loan growth. Heavy spenders have a particularly large impact on increasing purchase volume and have been a major driver of strong Domestic Card purchase volume growth that has generally exceeded loan growth over time. This spend velocity has driven increases in net interchange revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue. And these interchange fee revenues -- revenue annuities are strong and sustained over very long-term customer relationships. Our heavy spender franchise generates financial results that are attractive, less volatile and very resilient. As a result, the heavy spender business requires less capital and delivers strong long-term returns on capital. Pulling way up, our 10-year quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing, but the sustained revenue, credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling, and they're growing. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, choices we made in our auto business impacted several Consumer Banking trends. We pulled back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics. As you'd expect, many auto lenders have raised pricing as rising interest rates drove higher marginal funding costs, but some others have kept pricing relatively flat. These competitors have gained market share and pressured industry margins. We chose to pull back on auto originations, which declined 20% year-over-year and 12% from the linked quarter. As we pulled back on originations, the year-over-year growth of ending loans in the Consumer Banking business decelerated to 9% in the second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1%. Second quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 2% year-over-year, aided in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits from our commercial bank. Consumer Banking deposits declined 1% from the sequential quarter. Consumer Banking revenue was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter as growth in auto loans was offset by the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees and the year-over-year decline in auto margins.  Auto margin compression was primarily driven by the increase in our marginal funding costs, resulting from rapid interest rate increases and the aggressive competitor pricing that, I just discussed. Noninterest expense was up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by the increased marketing for our digital national bank and continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses. Second quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $306 million in the second quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $281 million. We added to the allowance for credit losses in our auto business in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continue to gradually normalize, but we remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  The charge-off rate for the second quarter was 0.61%, up 73 basis points from the unsustainably low, in fact, negative quarterly charge-off rate a year ago. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47%, up 121 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was down 5 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 62 basis points. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans and revenue in the quarter. Second quarter ending loan balances were up 9% from the sequential quarter. Average loans increased 5%. Growth in selected industry specialties drove our growth.  Ending deposits were down 14% from the first quarter and down 10% year-over-year, driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that I mentioned a few moments ago, as well as rate-driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns. In the second quarter, deposit balances were also impacted by seasonal outflows.  Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter and 26% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was down modestly from the linked quarter and up 16% year-over-year. Provision for credit losses increased $214 million from the first quarter, largely driven by a build in the allowance for credit losses. Commercial Banking credit remained strong in the second quarter.  The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 14 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.3%, and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.7%. In closing, we continued to drive good growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. Consumer Banking loan growth continued, albeit at a slower pace. And our Commercial Banking business posted strong growth in loans and revenue.  Credit results remain across our businesses, with charge-off rates and delinquency rates well below pre-pandemic levels even as credit continues to gradually normalize. And we continued to return capital to our shareholders. For more than three decades, we have hardwired resilience into every underwriting and growth choice we make in good times and bad. And we've steadfastly focused on building an enduring franchise. Sticking to these core tenets, we've demonstrated resilience through several cycles. We've been in a strong position to seize opportunities as markets evolve and as cycles played out. And we've delivered significant value over the long-term. And we're living by these same core tenets today. We continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities long after the normalization trends and cyclical credit pressures play out. We're confident in the choices we're making. As we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and increasing economic uncertainty, our credit results remain strong. We're staying focused on the most resilient businesses and sub-segments. And we're continuing to hone the proprietary underwriting and product structures that have driven our resilience through prior cycles. All of these growth in credit risk management choices are enhanced by our technology transformation. We're managing costs tightly even as we continue to invest in transforming our technology and digital capabilities that are the engine of future growth and efficiency. While the imperatives and marketplace opportunities and risks impact the timing, we remain focused on delivering operating leverage over the long-term powered by growth and digital productivity gains. And we're managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a strong position to weather a broad range of possible economic scenarios and to emerge in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities that are often generated as cycles play out. Pulling way up, we believe that our long-standing core tenets and the choices they drive today are putting us in a strong position to continue to deliver resilience and compelling long-term shareholder value as the sweeping digital transformation of banking continues. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Danielle? Good evening Ryan. Ryan, we -- on the early bonuses, I mean, that's really tied to how hard we lean into Venture X, for example. I mean we have early spend bonuses pretty much across our rewards business. So, let me separate a little bit. So, we have the launch of Venture X, and some companies launches are sort of a quarter long kind of thing. We continue to lean into that. You've seen our national advertising continue on that. So, the early spend bonuses continue as part of that and then also their early spend bonuses at a stable rate for the -- some of our other rewards products as well. With respect to the economy, we -- it's not lost on us that there's a lot of noise out there in the economy. And we -- every day, we talk about this and there's always uncertainty. There's probably, I think, more uncertainty at the moment and probably on average, and that's not lost on us. We -- so we don't make a top-of-the-house decision that says we're going to spend this much on marketing because these decisions are very -- decisions at the margin based on models and estimated loss rates and putting resilience factors in there and response rates and a lot of things. There has been some trimming around the edges in card quite a bit more so in auto, by the way, as I talked about just a few minutes ago. But staying with card for a minute, there has been some trimming around the edges. But generally, the kind of core target segments that we've been going after, we are continuing to feel good about and lean into. So, I think your net impression should be that while we have a very watchful eye on the economy and obsess about it every day, our underwriting decisions underwrite systematically. At Capital One, we underwrite to a worsening scenario. And so we feel good about our originations. And -- but one thing about our tech transformation that has really been good also is it allows us to move and adapt much more quickly. In most -- in companies and frankly, in some of our past years, when we decided to turn, it sometimes took quite a bit of time to move the whole machine. We've been able to create a much more adaptive and responsive infrastructure at Capital One. And so that's also helpful in a time of uncertainty. But net-net, we feel good about the opportunities, and we're leaning into them. Sorry, sorry. Kevin, thank you. The auto business is one that -- I mean, we're still -- we still see significant opportunity in the auto business. But, of course, what we always share with investors is how we're feeling at the moment and at the margin. So the biggest at the moment thing that we wanted to share with you is how the competitive environment feels. And we've been saying for some time that the low charge-offs, we worry that too long of a period of low charge-offs and too long of a period of, in many ways, unsustainably high used car prices can dull the senses of players in the auto industry and cause a weakening in underwriting. We haven't really seen -- that's not the primary story that we see. We certainly are on the lookout for that. The story has really been more hijacked, if you will, by what's happened with inflation and the significant increase in -- for companies and in cost of funds. And most auto players, and certainly, the money center, in particular, have moved up their pricing very consistently and responsibly to the increases in the underlying cost of funds in the economy. And what is striking is that, some competition has not. There are a few large players whose movement is -- in pricing is well behind that. And then you have the credit unions who have, I think, a very different kind of business model and a different way to calculate what their funding cost is. The credit unions have really not moved at all in terms of their pricing, and they've had actually a very significant increase in market share. So we are -- we continue to be very dedicated to the auto business. We have relationships with dealers. We're not -- this is not like a huge pullback, but what we're doing at the margin is, with the tighter margins that now at least temporarily exist in the business, for us, that has led us to trim around the edges. That's, I think, the biggest story that we would say in auto. The other thing is used car pricing. Let's talk just a little bit about that, Kevin. Vehicle values remain strikingly high and obviously well above pre-pandemic levels. And supply constraints remain the biggest factors supporting high vehicle values. And everything that we see suggests vehicle production will remain constrained in the near-term. And even when production normalizes, I think it will take time for dealers to rebuild their inventories. So probably the near-term outlook is pretty good with respect to used car values. But if I pull up a concern that I've often voiced is that from an underwriting point of view, what really matters is not the absolute level of collateral values, but the relative value of collateral values versus the underwriting assumptions that a lender made. And so we assume significant declines in collateral values in our underwriting, but we have a watchful eye on an industry that for quite some time now has been hopefully not getting used to the used car prices that are at relatively -- are at record levels versus anything we've seen in the past. So I think the auto opportunity continues to be a significant one for Capital One, but particularly driven by pricing, which may, by the way, ameliorate for certainly everyone except the credit unions in a relatively short period of time. But until then, we will continue to be pretty tight around the edges, and we wanted to share that with you. Okay. So -- well, thanks. Let's just kind of pull up and talk about inflation. We haven't seen sustained inflation in the US in many decades, but it's been running above 5% for over a year now, and it reached, I think, 9.1% in June. And producer prices are increasing even faster. And of course, the Fed has started raising rates in response, and the market expects further increases. So what I want to do is maybe list some of the potential impacts to our business of sustained inflation, and it's mostly negative. So if the economy suffers as a result of efforts to slow inflation, we will certainly feel that. And the biggest way that we would feel that would be in consumer credit losses. Consumers also were already starting to feel the impact of price inflation outpacing wage growth. Also in our lending business, higher cost of funds could put pressure on our margins, especially if lenders don't adjust pricing in response.  And we're already seeing that in the auto business. By the way, in the card business, just as a comparison, I've been struck by generally the responsiveness of the pricing in the card business to be responsively adaptive to interest rates. I mean it's a variable rate product, but also just in terms of offered rate by competitors, that seems to have moved much more dynamically than what we've seen selectively in auto.  Then other things about the impact of interest rate increases, let me think. We've got a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you can sometimes see lower demand for credit products just because headline pricing seems higher even if real pricing isn't. And in our underwriting a\u0302\u0080\u0093 well, let me just say one thing, and you put your finger on it. Well, a striking thing right now is, how low the unemployment rate is. And we have certainly seen in our modeling of credit over all the decades, we've been doing this at Capital One.  From a macroeconomic point of view, the biggest direct driver of credit losses is unemployment. And so, we start in a very strong position now. But to your point, there's irony in the strength of this position, and it could contribute to some of the affects you identified.  I do want to also just -- while we're on the subject of inflation, though, just highlight a few favorable effects of inflation as well. Existing debt levels will decrease in real terms in a period of sustained inflation. High vehicle values, which support auto credit, may be more sustainable in a high inflation environment. But in total, I think the effects tilt definitely in the negative direction.  So, it's a tough thing to model collectively all these things, but what we do is we start with sort of a general theory of how this stuff works. We try to incorporate it into the decision-making that we do. And then like a hawk, we look for these various effects to happen and are prepared to be responsive.  And in fact, just the one last thing I want to say is, I've always felt that it's very hard to predict economic cycles. I don't think Capital One is in a better position than anyone else to predict economic cycles. Sometimes you've seen us weigh in, in predicting credit cycles, which can be correlated, but not the same thing as that. But the most important thing that -- what I take away from years of doing this is, it's very hard to predict these cycles.  The key thing is to underwrite to a resilience level to make it very successfully through cycles, and that's been a cornerstone of our strategy, actually since the founding day of Capital One. So Rick, I don't know if we explicitly run around with a -- I wouldn't say our view is that stark as you say it, but I think that we certainly feel the most bullish about the card business. Let's talk about why for a second. First of all, just as the business and with the business model Capital One has, with the resilience it's shown through several downturns now and the power of leveraging data and analytics and mass customization to that business, I think that we feel particularly high level of resilience in that business, and that has been demonstrated in the past. And if anything, I think the technology transformation and some of the continued choices we've made like dialing back from high balance revolvers and other things has -- and as I said, the whole heavy spender push, I think, has put Capital One and actually an even stronger position from a resilience point of view. Also in terms of what we see going on with the -- in the business, there is normalization, but it is really quite gradual. By the way, the normalization is gradual across all of our businesses. But the -- but I want to point out just a bit of a math point in auto, for example. Auto is normalizing gradually, so is card, but -- and the front book with respect to auto and card, which are both normalizing faster than the back book, by the way, I've seen that universally, whenever there's normalization, one always sees it more in the front book than in seasoned back books. But if you think about auto as an average life of like two years, and Credit Card last much longer than that. And so as there's front book normalization, the replacement speed in the portfolio in auto is much faster than in card. So even for the same amount of normalization in those two businesses, in, say, the front book, you're going to get just mathematically faster normalization in auto. So it is our expectation. It would be surprising to us if that weren't the case, more just because of the math of replacement of a more rapidly turning over portfolio. So, we certainly -- card is the business we're most bullish about is the one that we're leaning hardest into. And you'll notice our story here. We're not -- our story is not a universal one that says I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but we feel great about growth. So, we're leaning into it everywhere. You can see an example of what you've seen over the years of how Capital One works. Everything is choices that is made at the margin locally, I mean, in various businesses. And the fact that in auto, we're pulling back significantly as we've talked about while leaning pretty hard in the card and certain parts of commercial is a window into that very phenomenon. Rick, thank you very much. So Don, thank you for that. Let's start by just talking about the consumer. Certainly, I'm certainly struck by the starting point of where the consumer is because the US consumer remains quite healthy. We see sustained improvements in consumer balance sheets coming out of the pandemic. Let's see. Debt servicing burdens remain near like mutli decade lows. The savings rate has dipped below pre-pandemic levels over the past few months, but cumulative savings over the last two years remain a significant positive still for consumers on average. We see higher bank account balances and higher household net worth across the income spectrum. Labor market demand remains exceptionally strong with record numbers of job openings and solid wage growth. And in our own portfolio, we see continuing strength in our delinquency roll rates and recovery rates. Despite times of credit normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any standard -- any historical standards. So that is the context that we see. But to your point, the big headwinds for consumers are price inflation and higher interest rates. And inflation could erode the excess savings consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth. Higher interest rates could push up debt servicing burdens, although this effect is muted by the fact that most existing household debt is in fixed rate mortgages and auto loans. So I'm struck by, though, the strong starting point for consumers as we look into the potential -- the headwinds of inflation and more economic trouble. And I would contrast this, of course, to the Great Recession or the global financial crisis, which -- where the consumer was in a much weaker position going into that. Now the strength of the consumer is pretty much across the board -- across the -- from the top of the market into sub-prime. And so I think the thing most striking is how sort of universal it is. But it is also the case that normalization is a bit more pronounced in sub-prime than it is higher in the market. But these a\u0302\u0080\u0093 these populations, though, Also more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So, I think these trends shouldn't be surprising. So, I think certainly a\u0302\u0080\u0093 now FICO score and income are not the same thing. But a lot of times, people tend to state them in the same breadth. Our subprime business is definitionally about people with FICO scores below a certain level.  But I think that the consumer starts in a strong place, then we should probably expect normalization to be a little faster on the lower end. And interestingly, if you switch to kind of income, which is a different cut than FICO certainly, and income, I'm struck by the fact that consumers a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the wage growth for the lower income consumers is -- they're kind of the one category, the lower income consumers, where their wage growth has been keeping up with inflation, but that won't necessarily continue, but that's also a position of strength. But pulling way up, I think we could see normalization a little faster in subprime. I think, in fact, we already can see very modestly that effect. But of course, in our underwriting and the whole business model of Capital One, that's also where we have built in kind of the biggest buffers of resilience. So, we feel good about that part of the marketplace. We feel good really across the credit spectrum and to lean into our marketing opportunity. Yes. So, competition in the rewards space is, I'd say, more intense than pre-pandemic -- a bit more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but largely unchanged in recent quarters. So early spend bonuses in points offers were slightly more aggressive than in the first quarter, and we continue to see certain offers come in and out of market.  Cash, early spend bonuses are higher now than pre-pandemic, but have been relatively stable at these elevated levels since basically mid last year. And then if we look at the baseline rewards earn rates, particularly in the cashback space, they overall were probably more aggressive in the middle of 2021 as new products were being introduced, but it's been relatively calm since. Now we feel great about our flagship products. We continue to be very pleased by consumers' response and engagement with them. We're very pleased with the launch of our Venture X card. But I think if I pull way up, Moshe, one of the things that I so deeply believe and have experienced is that winning in the heavy spender space, I think it requires good products, but you can't win with good products. It takes a lot more than that. And the customer experience, specifically the digital experience, the brand, the -- a lot of experiential things that are way beyond the product are part of the whole package. And what we have said -- this is why we've been saying for years now that winning at the top of the market is not an in and out thing. It is a matter of choosing as a few players have done, Capital One being one of them that, that's where we're going, and we're going to continue to lean into that. And I have been struck by the sustainable success that we have been generating. And also the marketplace, while very intense hasn't tipped over to being unreasonable or irrational. So it's very competitive, but I continue to really like our opportunity in that space. Arren, let me just add that this is -- I want to underscore the strategy that Capital One has had for years now, which is, we are building a national bank through, not by just acquiring branches on every corner across the United States, nor by just having a national digital bank, but really building a, in a sense, full-service digital bank that can provide almost everything that you can get in a local branch to provide it nationally -- excuse me, digitally. And that is part of our strategy to build primary banking relationships that are digital-first and digitally originated. And it's all part of a larger strategy to build a consumer banking franchise that is not about just the highest rate paid, but really about high-quality products, a great customer experience and a full-service set of capabilities where people can -- banking relationship and then also have savings deposits there. And one of the -- one of my comments that I made about our marketing levels, which, everybody notices, are high is, one thing we've continued to invest in over time is, Capital One as a company that doesn't have branches on every corner. We've got branches on some corners, but a greater proportion of our expenditures are on the marketing side, are on the brand building side and, to some extent, on the tech side as well. But it is very much in service of building a franchise of -- a brand and a franchise that enables us to dynamically grow our deposits at very appropriate blended pricing and build long-term loyal banking relationships. And we're very pleased with the success we've had in that, but we continue invest very much in that. Good evening, Betsy. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Sorry. I have in front of me -- I don't think it's the exact thing you're asking, but I have in front of me some growth rates, in fact, finishing growth since -- versus 2019 of a bunch of categories that I find pretty fascinating, but this is not -- this isn't our own mix, but these things in fact mix things, I guess, but gas 90%. Now by the way, this is a\u0302\u0080\u0093 this includes growth by Capital One overall. There's been significant growth of our whole business. So -- but just some relative comparisons. Travel, 26%, although travel is second to gas, if I look at year-over-year gross, only gas as a category has grown more. So gas is up 54% year-over-year. The travel is up 42% year-over-year, and those are swamping most of the other categories there. But travel was way the laggard during the downturn, and it's been -- like I said, other than a\u0302\u0080\u0093 than energy, it has been the one that is really catching up quickly. So what's striking is just how much these things vary across categories as the consumer reacts to the COVID or energy costs. And also, it'll be interesting to see how much the consumer migrates to whether -- to -- between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. We'll keep a close eye on that one as things get a little tighter in the marketplace. Yes. So first, pulling up, it's not lost on us that our assets are growing rapidly. Right now, all banks are growing more slowly in deposits. So, we -- I think that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I mean this is a natural thing that happens at this part of the cycle. And so, this is why I made my earlier comments about being very pleased that we have already been leaning into having a deposit franchise and being in a position to build primary banking relationships, to grow savings accounts, to have a brand as a company that will have attractive savings rates, but not to have to go generate all our business off of the bank rate tables kind of marketplace.  So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but with respect to the economics, Dominick, I think the card margins are such that -- it's hard to imagine that we wouldn't continue to make the trade that even if we have to pay more for deposits, we would not turn down the growth opportunity. So long as the deposits are available and they're there, it's going to be a good trade to continue growing that card business as far out as we can see because of the particularly robust economics that come with our card franchise.  But just to finish off that point. I'm sorry. But we also like being in a position as a national bank with a national brand for digital banking that we're in a position to gather the deposits we need in order to fund the kind of growth opportunity that we have at a time when it's going to get harder to grow deposits at this part of the cycle. Thanks, everybody. Good night."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Danielle, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $2 billion or $4.96 per diluted common share. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans held for investment grew 6% and average loans grew 4%, driven by growth across all of our segments. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% or 3% after accounting for the $192 million gain on sale recognized in the prior quarter. Non-interest expense grew 1% in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion driven mostly by net charge-offs of $845 million and a $200 million allowance build. Turning to slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The total company's $200 million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up 2% to $11.5 billion as of June 30th. Our total company coverage ratio decreased 15 basis points to 3.88%. The changes in allowance and coverage ratio varied by segment, which I'll cover on slide five. Across all our businesses, loan growth and a worsening economic outlook drove upward pressure on allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $145 million. The coverage in Consumer Banking increased 14 basis points to 2.51%. In our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $152 million. The coverage in Commercial Banking increased five basis points and now stands at 1.36%. In addition to the allowance build, there was also $39 million of provision related to unfunded lending commitments. In our Domestic Card business, we released $128 million of allowance despite the effects of the growth and worsening economic outlook I previously mentioned. We have seen some signs of gradual normalization in our card credit metrics. But so far, the pace of that normalization has been slower than what we assumed when we set last quarter's allowance. The impact of this slower-than-assumed normalization more than offset the growth and worsening economic outlook, leading to the allowance release. We continue to carry elevated levels of qualitative reserves for downside risks related to economic uncertainty. The coverage ratio for Domestic Card now stands at 6.82%. Turning to page six. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 144%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves declined $17 billion in the quarter as our liquidity normalizes towards pre-pandemic levels. Cash and cash equivalents declined about $5 billion and now stands at $22 billion. We also had a $6 billion decline in our securities portfolio driven by the combination of the mark from rising interest rates and the continued runoff of the outsized portfolio built during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I'll cover our net interest margin. Net interest income in the quarter was $6.5 billion, up 13% from the year ago quarter and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.54%, 65 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and five basis points higher than the prior quarter. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we continue to deploy excess cash and securities into loan growth. The linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by an additional day to recognize revenue. Higher yields on assets in the quarter were offset by higher wholesale funding and deposit costs. Outside of quarterly day count, our NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, the impacts of interest rates beyond forwards, wholesale funding costs, and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.1% at the end of the second quarter, down about 60 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in risk-weighted assets. We continue to estimate that our long-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. In the quarter, the pace of our repurchases slowed to about $2 billion. The pace of any future repurchases will be driven by a number of factors, including our actual and forecasted capital earnings, growth, economic conditions and market dynamics. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure, Sanjay. Why don't I start with beta and just give a little bit of detail there and then feather it into the broader NIM question you asked. And so when you look at our deposits, roughly 15% are a combination of commercial and brokered, which have higher betas, but really the 800-pound gorilla is the -- something like 85% of the deposits that are in retail. So, I'll focus mostly there. And I think looking back on history as a guide is a bit of a challenge in this cycle. So we've already seen 150 bps of move in the first six months. We're expecting another 200 or so over the next. And in the last rising cycle, it took three and a half years to just get to 200 in that first year. We moved 50 in total versus the 350 we might see this year. And so I share that context to say the faster and larger set of moves, coupled with quantitative tightening and the possibility of some competitors being a bit more aggressive to fund their loan growth, all will play into how competitors behave and the overall level of deposits. And so if I look at the last rising cycle, we were at something like 40%. And the last falling cycle, we were around 50. But given the factors that I described a moment ago, it's hard to really pinpoint exactly what's going to transpire looking ahead, but I would think our cumulative beta could be around or slightly above the last rising cycle. And so in line with what you've seen historically, beta moves pretty slowly in the beginning to the first set of hikes. And so this quarter, you saw that we were high single-digits, but the planned rate hikes for the second half of the year are likely going to pressure that beta up. And so, when I take that and factor it into our NIM outside, obviously, of the quarterly day count effects, the tailwinds to our NIM are going to be the asset mix moving towards higher yielding assets like card. And what we saw in this quarter, by the way, ending card loans grew faster than average, so the more that card is growing relative to other asset classes and the cash and investment portfolio and then just the broader asset yield increases from the higher interest rates. Those are things that are going to be tailwinds. The headwinds are going to be the deposit costs, not only from the rising deposit betas that I just described, but also wholesale funding costs to the extent that we do more of that and depending on credit spreads in the marketplace. But there isn't one dominant force in those factors from where we stand today. So I think they're all going to be pushing against one another and we're going to see where that nets out in the coming quarters. Hey Moshe, it's Andrew. And I think if you put the card yield in the context of a longer term history, looking a year ago, it's up 100 basis points. And that's really been a shift to a higher mix of assets in our branded book, which is both growth of existing customers and the success we're seeing in the originations that Rich talked about. And as we sit here today and looking over the last few quarters, we're also seeing a modest uptick in fees from the very low levels last year and so driven by the delinquencies that have ticked up very gradually year-over-year. But I think having a yield at these levels is something that has sustained. But to your point of how can we drive it up, I think we're seeing an impact from rate changes that's been a bit of a tailwind on the yield side. But clearly, that comes with a funding cost that ultimately will probably leave margin much closer to flat. Well, Arren, it depends a bit on the degree to which they're revolving versus just pure transacting. But if they're transacting, they're bringing quite a bit of interchange and relatively low outstandings over time. So, that very well could prove to be a net positive and not create the downward pressure that you just described. And not to mention the fact that in doing so, it creates less of a capital need. And so it ends up being over time at least a pretty capital-efficient business, which is one of the reasons why we've been on this decade-long journey to build that franchise. Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on what we see so far this quarter. But let's take a step back and think about the industry context and then talk a little bit about our strategy there. As you look at the industry, you brought up, at least in retail, the tax outflow phenomenon that happened in the second quarter, and we certainly felt a little bit of that. But where industry deposit balances go from here, first thing is at least history, whether it repeats itself, would indicate that the rate of deposit growth drops in rising rate environment. And in this particular cycle, the Fed fund rates, as I mentioned to Sanjay's question, are both larger and faster than previous ones, and the Fed shrinking its balance sheet. So who knows? I guess this is good as yours, but I think we could see a scenario where industry-wide deposits are flattish to down in the near-term. And so what we choose to do there is really trying to optimize our balance sheet across a number of different dynamics of liquidity and funding and tenor and pricing. And so we feel like we're in a great position to compete in that industry backdrop with simple straightforward competitive products that have a great user experience. But where our deposits ultimately go from here in the context of that industry will be a function of our deposit needs and competitive dynamics. No. It's really just the loss content of that book, Betsy. Well, just to repeat a little bit, Betsy, of what I shared in my prepared remarks there's just a number of factors to consider, just our forecasted level of capital and earnings and growth, but we need to put those things in the context with a particular eye to the error bars around those estimates. And so what I was mostly trying to highlight is if you look back a year ago, we were at 14.5% CET1, that's down to 12 1 this quarter. And so we're getting much closer to that 11% level. And at a time when there are a number of uncertainties given the economic environment and the growth opportunities, those error bars just start to matter more. And so we slowed down a bit in the second quarter. But as always is the case, managing capital both conservatively and efficiently is top of mind for us. And so looking ahead, we're just going to dynamically adjust our pace in the context of those evolving factors."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Global Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Keith.

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight\u2019s presentation. In the first quarter Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.62 per diluted common share. The results include one notable item, $192 million gain from the sale of two Card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter. Period end loans held for investment grew 1% on a linked-quarter basis and average loans grew 3%. Revenue in the linked-quarter increased 1%. Non-interest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by declines in both marketing and operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $677 million, as net charge-offs of $767 million were partially offset by an allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company we released $119 million of allowance in the first quarter and the total allowance balance now stands at $11.3 billion. We continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties. Our total company coverage ratio is now 4%. Turning to slide five, I will discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments. In our Total Card segment, the allowance balance declined $65 million, driven by our international Card businesses. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. With the slight decline in ending loans, the flat allowance balance in Domestic Card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to 7.38%. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $16 million, which when coupled with loan growth resulted in a 10 basis point decline in coverage to 2.37%. And in Commercial, the $41 million decline in allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement. The decline in coverage ratio was driven by both the allowance release, as well as growth. Turning to page six, I will now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 140%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. The investment portfolio ended the quarter at $89 billion, declining by about $6 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Rising rates drove a market value decline of $4.3 billion, with the remaining decline due to our continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I will cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.49%, 50 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 11 basis points lower than Q4. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift, as we deployed excess cash to loans. The linked-quarter decrease in NIM was driven by having two fewer days in the first quarter. Normalizing for day count effect, higher yields in both our Card business and in our investment portfolio were roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields. Outside of quarterly day count, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, interest rates and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7% at the end of the first quarter, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases, the impact of the CECL transition and higher risk weighted assets. Recall that the phasing of CECL transition relief began on January 1st. We recognize 25% of our $2.4 billion total after-tax phasing amount in the first quarter. Also in the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock as part of the $5 billion share authorization that our Board approved in January. Earlier this month, in addition to approving our CCAR 2022 submission and our capital plan, our Board of Directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional $5 billion of common stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I will begin on slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted strong year-over-year growth in every topline metric in the first quarter, as we continued our longstanding strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across the business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 26% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $16.9 billion or about 19% year-over-year. Ending loans were down just 1% from the sequential quarter, better than the typical seasonal decline of around 7% and revenue was up 20% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Domestic Card revenue margin for the first quarter was 18.3%. Revenue margin continued to benefit from spend velocity, which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth. Spend velocity is driven by the traction we are getting with heavy spenders. The margin also includes a gain from a Card partnership portfolio sale in the quarter. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.12%, a 42 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.32%, 8 basis points above the prior year. Gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 63 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 10 basis points. Non-interest expense was up 33% from the first quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $918 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but of course, not the only driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see opportunities to book Domestic Card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continued to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. Consumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong, and in our own portfolio, credit results continued to be well below pre-pandemic levels and they are normalizing gradually. We are keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. And as always, we are underwriting to worsening scenarios, even as we lean into marketing. Our Domestic Card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decade long focus on heavy spenders continues to gain traction. We increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of Venture X. Growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses, which show up in our marketing expense and part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise with investments in our new travel portal and airport lounges. And looking across the whole company, our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like Capital One Shopping in our Card business and Auto Navigator in our Auto business. And modern technology infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digital first National Direct Banking strategy in Consumer Banking. We are marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses. Our marketing is paying-off across these opportunities. We posted very strong growth in Domestic Card purchase volume, new accounts and loans. We are gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders. And away from the Card business, we are growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with Auto Navigator and our National Direct Banking business is winning with customers and driving growth. Speaking of our Auto and Retail Banking businesses, let\u2019s move to slide 12, which shows that strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the first quarter. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased 14% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 14%. First quarter auto originations were up 33% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, auto originations were up 20%. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our Auto business. We continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace. First quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. The year-over-year decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on booking higher quality loans within credit segment. Across the auto lending industry, the pace of price increases has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates. The decline in loan yields coupled with the pace of pricing changes has compressed margins in our Auto business. First quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $126 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $130 million. The allowance for credit losses in our Auto business was flat in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate are gradually normalizing, and remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the first quarter was 0.66%, up 19 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 73 basis points year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 8 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 47 basis points. Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. First quarter ending loan balances were up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization. Average loans were up 15%. Ending deposits grew 9% from the first year, excuse me, from the first quarter of 2021, as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits increased 12% year-over-year. First quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 16%. Commercial Credit performance remains strong. In the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.8%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We also posted strong Auto and Commercial growth. Credit is gradually normalizing and remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. Pulling way up, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity and it\u2019s the engine of enduring value creation over the long-term. And now, we will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich. Let\u2019s start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any questions following the Q&A, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Keith, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. So, obviously, the investor sentiment has turned quite cautious on the consumer, but it seems like, Rich you think credits doing, I mean clearly credit is doing quite well in your loan book and you guys are leaning into growth. Maybe you could just give us some perspective on some of the macro headwinds that the consumer is facing, and sort of how you see it progressing through the portfolio as the year progresses? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Hey, Sanjay. Yeah. So let\u2019s just talk about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer continues to be strong. While the savings rate has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels, the cumulative impact of savings over the last two years is still a significant positive. We see this in higher bank account balances and higher household net worth and it is true across the income spectrum. Now, of course, the bulk of government stimulus is now behind us and most industry forbearance programs are winding down. But I think we will see some sustained benefits from consumer deleveraging through the pandemic. Debt servicing burdens are lower than they have been in decades, supported both by deleveraging and by low interest rates. On the other side of the consumer balance sheet, labor market demand remained strong. So in our own portfolio, Sanjay, we see continuing strength in roll rates, cure rates and recovery rates, and even as we see signs of normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any historical standard. There are emerging headwinds as well, for example, high price inflation. The inflation has the potential to erode the excess savings, consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially of price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth and also higher interest rates would push debt servicing burdens back up. But if we pull up on the whole, I\u2019d say consumers are in good shape coming out of the pandemic relative to most historical benchmarks. In fact, the -- I am just learned over the years that, I have got a lot of confidence in how -- what consumers learn from downturns and scares that they have and the choices that they make and I think we are just seeing very rational behavior by consumers. I worry more about markets and how competitors operate and lending practices and things like that, we can save that for another question. But we still feel good about the consumer and look it is a natural thing, it would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is. And so, normalization, the root word in normalization is nor, and there is quite a journey to really sort of an equilibrium place for credit performance. And one of the reasons that we are still leaning pretty hard into our growth opportunities is our confidence in the consumer and our read of the marketplace at this time.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. And a follow-up question on some of the regulatory scrutiny we are seeing. There has been some chatter on Card loan fees and overdraft fees, the latter of which I think you guys have gotten in front of. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the Card loan fees -- the Card fees, chatter out there from some of the regulators and how it might affect your business? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Well, Sanjay, we as a company have been very focused on minimizing fees, just in general for our consumers. Obviously the overdraft announcement was a pretty dramatic case in point there. But even in the Card business, when you look, we really what Capital One has is an APR and a late fee and in some cases a cash advance fee, both of those fees are really to discourage certain behaviors that we don\u2019t think are in the interest of the consumer. So, yes, so our strategy has been to have pricing be upfront and have -- it be clear and very simple. Now late fees or something that we have continued to have late fees, because we wouldn\u2019t want our loved ones ending up paying late on their bill, so just late fee, I think is one of the natural fees that probably makes sense to have on a product. The fed is created a Safe Harbor with respect to late fees, maybe the industry well, that will be revisited and obviously we will watch that as we continue our business.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit more about the partnership portfolio sale, how to think about that from an asset perspective in the impact on the P&L in terms of revenue and any associated decline in expenses associated with that sale?\nAndrew Young: Yeah. Rick, it\u2019s Andrew. I mean, we disclosed the overall gains between the two portfolios of $192 million. The two portfolios combined, you saw probably last year when they got marked held for sale were roughly $4 billion, but below the surface there we are not going to get into specifically the run rate of revenue or the expenses associated with that in part, because we are growing the rest of the portfolio and you are going to see partnership businesses come in and out over time.\nRick Shane: Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good afternoon. Rich and Andrew, you have unique insight into consumers at both ends of the credit spectrum. Could you parse out for us in a little bit more detail, just following up on Sanjay\u2019s question? Specifically at what kinds of credit normalization trends you are seeing at both the high end and the low end of the credit spectrum, if you could sort of juxtapose those for us and maybe call out any differences? And then, perhaps, any possibility of that inflationary pressures could lead to a bit faster normalization at any -- at the lower end?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Hey, Bill. So we have for quite a long time saying, we should all expect normalization. In terms of what we see in normalization, I -- it\u2019s pretty early and pretty modest, in fact, if anything I guess, we would -- we are sort of struck by the how moderate the pace is, but we shouldn\u2019t necessarily count on that, but it is certainly striking so far. What we are seeing in normalization is really across the credit spectrum and across the income spectrum. It does seem that normalization is a bit more pronounced at the lower end of the market, if you sort of measure either in terms of income or credit score. But those are also populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So that\u2019s -- so I think we are seeing and we would expect this is and across the Boards kind of return toward normal over time. With respect to inflation, we worry a lot about inflation and that is something that, especially if inflation, as we have seen in, what it costs to live is faster than wage inflation. These can put pressures and sometimes can put pressures more on the -- in the Main Street America. And so it\u2019s something that we worry quite a bit about and I think that, it would be very natural for these inflation pressures to put more pressure on consumers.\nBill Carcache: Thank you, Richard. It\u2019s really helpful. If I may ask a related follow-up, maybe could you discuss the extent to which positive credit migration fueled by pandemic stimulus, that perhaps may have led you to increase line sizes and then now the extent to which we could sort of see a reversal in that and perhaps as credit normalizes, would you expect negative credit migration to ultimately lead to a reversal of those line sizes or is that not how it worked?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Over the years, we have worked hard to originate accounts, and we have said, it\u2019s kind of a coiled spring of growth opportunity and we uncoil the spring gradually based on customer performance and also the marketplace. And so we have as part of the growth that you see, while it\u2019s being powered by very strong originations and in some return to spending in Card usage by the back book, we also have been selectively increasing credit lines. Nothing dramatic, but it\u2019s consistent with my earlier comments about the consumer, and again, with great demonstration by the performance of our customers, we have been selectively increasing credit lines and I think I don\u2019t see anything that would change our lean in that direction. Again, it\u2019s selective and it assumes a worsening environment, it assumes normalization in all of those things. So I don\u2019t think we would be setup to be surprised there and I don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t have any conversations about trying to reverse that direction.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good evening. On the -- regarding the credit on the reserve front, I know you had released an incremental $190 million and you indicated that you do have additional qualitative reserves aside. I know your reserve ratio right now was a near your day one CECL level. How should we think about the potential for incremental reserve releases from here? Do you think that we stabilize at this level of the reserve ratio or do you think there is incremental room to release?\nAndrew Young: Well, John, when you quote the -- this is Andrew, by the way. When you quote the reserve level, keep in mind that there pretty significantly different reserve levels by asset class and so the total company level, of course, is influenced by that mix. So I would suggest we decompose it a bit by each of them since auto was a little bit below where it was on CECL day one and that\u2019s largely a function of the elevated used car prices, our mix in prime. So we are seeing loss rates that are much below, I think, 66 basis points was the number this quarter. And so all else equal, you would expect that our coverage ratio there would be well below, what it was at adoption and yet, it\u2019s only a little bit below and that\u2019s for the qualitative factors there. But the largest factor to the total company reserve will clearly be Card. And that\u2019s one where I think it\u2019s always helpful to just start with a reminder of how that allowance is constructed, because answering your question is really dependent on a number of assumptions, where quite frankly your guess could be as good as mine. And so with Card, the first thing that goes into the allowance is just the expectation of future losses and recoveries and you can see within our delinquency bucket in the near-term, but beyond that, we assume that there is a relatively swift normalization of losses from those unusually strong levels, historically strong. The second is the size of the balance sheet, which he saw this quarter is growing at a quite healthy pace when you normalize quarter-over-quarter for seasonal effects and certainly up 19%, I think the number is in Q1 for Card relative to a year ago. And then the third input is that level of qualitative factors and that\u2019s really just to account for a variety of risks related to inflation and various things that are impacting that and just uncertainty in the more macro economy. And so the future allowance is really going to be determined by how all of those effects net out. The one thing that I will just remind you is, what we call the quarter swap effect and that is as credit begins to normalize, we will be replacing a currently low loss quarter with a slightly higher loss quarter, so that\u2019s another thing that will create pressure, all else equal. But if favorable credit trends continue and the factors driving those qualitative reserve subside, we could see the allowance be down to flat. But if normalization plays out and we are growing at a significant clip, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we will see allowance release, in fact, I can see allowance build. So it\u2019s really just a function of all of those factors. Sorry for the long-winded technical answer there, but I just think all of those factors are really important for you to understand, because the range of outcome on the allowance is quite large.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay, Andrew. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just around consumer spend behavior and volumes. On behavior, are you seeing any shifts in spending on discretionary towards -- shifting towards non-discretionary? And then, secondly, are you -- on the volume side, do you forecast a slowdown in Card spend volume overall as the fed hikes and aims at slowing the economy? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, John. I have not -- look, recently a discretionary versus non-discretionary, so I don\u2019t want to speculate on that. I will tell you a thing that is -- certainly striking is what\u2019s happening with T&E spend these days. Just by way of comparison T&E spend was up 90%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, that was a very depressed quarter. But up around 20% from first quarter 2019 level. So there is a lot of -- I think would people sort of just bursting out and wanting to free themselves from some of what they have been through in the pandemic, we certainly see strength there. But I think your question about, as really inflation hits and we see just a lot of downstream effects that can happen from that, that certainly could impact Card spend. But I would say a lot of the traction that we have in Card spend is coming from our -- are really spender focused business, and frankly, heavy spender focused business and I think that, I am not sure that a change in inflation is going to have necessarily that much impact on the propensity of the heavy spenders to spend.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good evening, everyone.\nAndrew Young: Hey, Ryan.\nRichard Fairbank: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Hey, Rich, Andrew. So maybe just to start off, Rich, you referenced the competitive landscape out there in Card and Auto, a few times, I think you said larger upfront bonuses and you are closely watching some of the competitive dynamics. Can you maybe just talk about, what you are seeing out there and I think it\u2019s historically it\u2019s been unusual for you to be grown this fast when the rest of the market is also growing? So I am just wondering, can you maybe just talk about on the Card side, what you are seeing banks versus non-banks and anything you are seeing on the Auto side would be helpful at this point?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Ryan, I do have a smile at your comment, because often we have zagged while -- zig while others zag and we have -- you and I in fact have chatted about that and the reason sometimes behind it. Because it\u2019s not just an accident that sometimes has been our pattern, because part of what we are reading is the competitive marketplace and that has impact on the opportunity and on credit performance and selection dynamics and a lot of things. So your question is a great one, but I think a lot of companies out there to see the strength of the consumer. They are sort of feeling the consumer, sort of roaring back with respect to more normal activities. And I think people are leaning into to take advantage of that and certainly we are. But we -- let me talk a little bit just about the competition in the Card business. We certainly know that there is elevated marketing. All the companies are pretty much coming out and showing more marketing, talking about more marketing, so that is happening and we have a careful eye to see what that does to the opportunity that we are experiencing. But I will kind of come back to our opportunity there, but certainly marketing levels are elevated. Competition in the rewards space is probably a notch more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but it\u2019s pretty stable in recent quarters and not what I would call irrational. Certainly incredibly good players at the top of the market and there is a lot of competition there, but that hasn\u2019t really altered our view of the opportunity, either APRs generally been stable. Turning to the fintechs for a second, obviously we have seen a lot of, buy now pay later activity. I think that we should note that the fintechs who are in the lending business have been lending in the greatest rearview mirror of credit -- industry credit performance that you could ever imagine. And businesses like instalment lending based businesses sometimes are pretty sensitive in that environment. So I -- but we continue to see quite a bit of activity on fintechs as well. But on the Card side, before I turn to Auto, all -- we have an eye on the competition, I think generally the competition while intense is not unreasonable, we have not seen the big changes in people\u2019s underwriting policy, the kinds of things that -- we haven\u2019t seen dramatic changes in pricing. So I think it\u2019s more, I would label it at the intense level that we would expect that a time like this, but not unreasonable and not something that would cause us to move off our pretty strong lean into the growth opportunity. So in the Auto business, let me just talk a little bit about this. The competition in the Auto business continues to remain intense. It\u2019s showing up across the Board from credit unions, big banks and small independent lenders, and it\u2019s playing out across all Credit segments. And you just kind of double-click into that for a second, credit unions that have been wash with deposits, they have been gaining significant share, consistent with what we have observed during prior cycles and especially as interest rates go up a little bit. And let\u2019s talk in fact about rising interest rates. I think it\u2019s almost always the case in business that when in a sense a cost of goods sold rises, there typically is a lag and how that makes it way into consumer pricing. What we have -- as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we have not seen the marketplace, the auto marketplace yet respond in terms of pricing relative to what\u2019s actually happening to interest rates, so there is a some compression there. I think typically what we have seen in the past is competitors respond with differing speeds to interest rate increases. So sometimes players like credit unions tend to and maybe they have different FTP methodologies or whatever it tend to be sort of the slowest to respond, but we -- so we will have to keep an eye on that. But I think that, we are really excited about our opportunity in the Auto business. The technology products that we have out there are really cutting edge and getting a huge amount of traction. Our -- I is just very careful on the pricing out there and also just whether there is an over exuberance relative to the number of planets that are aligned in the auto lending business, particularly what sort of happened to used car values and is -- and in fact that still there, just keep an eye on whether that industry can remain as rational as it\u2019s been in the last couple of years.\nRyan Nash: Maybe as a quick follow-up, sticking with things that are unusual, Andrew, you guys are continuing to aggressively return capital. I think you have two different $5 billion asset  out there, which again is unusual for you guys. I was wondering, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of the utilization of those and how to think about use of capital as you are getting closer to the 11% CET1 target? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Yeah. I recall that in January, we did not have an active program at the time, so our Board authorized $5 billion and capital levels were even higher than they are today at that point. And so earlier this month in conjunction with the approval of the capital plan in our CCAR submission they authorized an additional $5 billion, which coincides with the capital plan and therefore would be available at the start of the third quarter. But in terms of the pace of that activity, it feels a little bit different than it did when we were at 14.5% over a year ago. To your point like asymptotically we are sort of heading towards 11% and so the pace of repurchases is as always is going to be dependent on our primary use of capital for loan growth and then the dividends. But beyond that, we are going to keep a really close eye on just the level of capital and earnings and growth and end market dynamics and take advantage of the fact that we are able to operate under the SCB framework and maintain that flexibility. So nothing specific in terms of the timeline there, but just wanted to be clear about the approvals when we announced it a few weeks ago.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good evening.\nAndrew Young: Hi, Betsy.\nRichard Fairbank: Hi. Good evening, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I guess, just switching gears a little bit. I wanted to ask a little bit about what you are seeing with regard to payment rates and is there any differentiation amongst the customer base as to how that\u2019s been projecting?\nRichard Fairbank: So, Betsy, we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base and while lately it\u2019s been sort of flattening out if you will, I mean, payment rates are just well above pre-pandemic levels. And while not a perfect proxy, you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in March remained close to 50%. One of the more recent drivers of higher repayment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and healthy consumer balance sheets and we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize, maybe you know it\u2019s kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect. And I certainly believe payment rates will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit. So over time, the normalization of credit plausibly leads to some normalization of higher payment -- of normal, excuse me, a payment rate. I think there is another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet, behind our payment rate numbers and that is that each year we are gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders. Also you may remember for years we talked about, gosh, this goes all the way back to the Great Recession, Capital One\u2019s systematic avoidance of high balance revolvers, which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times, but is a move for the sake of resilience. But I think this sort of systematic effects of avoiding high balance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our payment rate as well. But, certainly, probably, the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the marketing piece, I know we spoke about a little bit earlier in the call. But as we are thinking through the opportunities that we have, do you feel like there is an opportunity to lean into marketing kind of Q-by-Q-by-Q to a greater degree. So we should build half off of 1Q, such that our marketing is higher year-on-year, full year and that\u2019s what I am getting from the conversation earlier, but I just want to make sure it\u2019s the right takeaway?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, yeah, let me just -- why don\u2019t I do this, Betsy, let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had. There are few things driving our marketing levels higher these days. First of all, the opportunities that we see. We are seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and we are leaning hard into them while the opportunities are there. In our Card business, we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we are originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation, which is enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and enable customized solutions. So we are seeing significant traction in originations across our business. And I want to note that, so much of our Card business overall and our growth is in our Branded Card franchise, as opposed to co-brand and private label partnerships. And by the way we also like those businesses, but for Capital One that\u2019s a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And in Branded Card, we enjoy the full economics of the business and we own the customer franchise. So while the industry doesn\u2019t track data on this, I think, our share growth in Branded Card s is particularly noteworthy. And Branded Card is, of course, as the word implies, it\u2019s about our brand and we continue to invest in the company\u2019s brand and in the flagship products. And some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from having so much Branded Card, where we own all the economics. But the flip side of that is that, the marketing and the brand building are entirely on us and that all shows up in our marketing numbers. But that\u2019s an absolute centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise. Now second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction we are getting in our more than decade long journey, to drive more and more our market with a focus on the heavy spenders. So we launched our venture Card way back in 2010 and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders. But it hasn\u2019t just been about flagship Card s, it\u2019s been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and that\u2019s about great products with heavy reward content, it\u2019s about great servicing, it\u2019s about customer experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles, and of course, an exceptional digital experience. So for years we have been on this journey and every year we have had growing traction and while our whole franchise of spenders has grown nicely, we have grown even faster with heavier spenders. And with each year of success we have had the license to stretch a little higher up market and we are continuing to invest to make that possible. And lately, you have seen our launch of our travel portal which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace. You have seen the launch of airport lounges, which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent travelers. And last fall, we launched Venture X, which moved us into the next tier of premium Card s. And that launch has been very successful and we continue to invest in the growth of that product. You can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase volume growth that we have had. Over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods, you will find Capital One with -- posting really high in your top of the league tables, if not at the top of the league tables purchase volume growth. And also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our Branded Card s and that\u2019s why you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin. This journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional Card business. It has higher upfront cost, brand building, higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions, and of course, investment in high end experiences. But long-term value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high spend levels, strong margins, very low losses, low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our franchise. So the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance and that\u2019s a continuing long-term benefit of these investments. I just want to mention the third factor contributing to the higher marketing, if some of the traction that we are getting with our new digital offerings, including Auto Navigator, Capital One Shopping and our National Bank. And just to comment on the National Bank, which unlike Capital One, unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank acquisitions, we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically, which of course, does take marketing investment. So that was just, take me a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing that you are seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it. Now, due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest, those quest being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move up market. This has -- these things are contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days. So that is -- that sort of a pulling out sort of a narrative on why it is that we are leaning hard into marketing and it\u2019s a combination of sort of the opportunity at the moment, as well as capitalizing on the journey that\u2019s been many years in the making. Typically, we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year. An important contributor to our marketing was things related to that, for example, the launch of venture Card s, early spend bonuses and things like that. So things are not -- it\u2019s not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years. We are not specifically giving a guidance on the rest of the year, but I just wanted to share with you, why it is that we are leaning in the marketing, what\u2019s driving that and I am -- as you can probably tell from the answer, I am really enthused about our opportunities and we are though leaning into take advantage of them and a lot of that is about marketing.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Rich, just wondering, what would it take to see both kind of -- you talked about some of the potential pressures particularly for the lower end consumer in terms of inflation and other sorts of things. What would it take to actually start to see you pulled back both at the lower end consumer and for the higher spenders, like what sort of -- what will be the warning signs?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. So, Moshe, with respect to the lower end consumers, it\u2019s less about, let\u2019s imagine we don\u2019t have to do very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one, where the consumers in a more challenged place where the competitors are -- have gone a whole notch more aggressive. And what I think is more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big dial back say in origination machines. So we just more cautious online, try to continue to build the franchise, maybe not as aggressively as sometimes. But, again, we have over our 30 years, Moshe, in building sort of Main Street franchise, really do a lot of the regulating and things on the loan side . On heavy spenders we continued to find so much traction and what I have often said about the quest for heavy spenders, unlike a lot of things that I have seen in our business journey, this is not a thing that is very well suited to a blitz here a pullback of blitz and a pull back. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t be dialing the knobs up and down, on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever. But this is and I think there is a reason that not very many players are really, really successful at the top of the market. This is about really building a franchise at that end of the market. That\u2019s not just taking regular consumer products and addressing them up with more rewards or the fancy advertising and the -- that\u2019s why, I mentioned, this journey that were like in the 12th year of the journey where we declared we are going to just keep moving up market. One can\u2019t do it overnight. It\u2019s something you have to earn along the way. But all of our metrics continue to show traction and success, traction on brand metrics as well, and pretty much all the customer metrics, you have seen what\u2019s happening on purchase volumes, the -- when we track, the things that we have booked over the years we sort of love the annuities we are booking. So that to me is something that we are going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time. But what we will -- the things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices, certain product choices, but that one, that I partly shared -- I want to share this a little bit more about this today that that\u2019s a journey that Capital One has been on as part of our central part of our strategy in Card for a lot of years.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks, Rich. And as -- maybe as a follow up, could you talk a little bit about where you see the industry and Capital One in terms of the deposit price competition is now starting to see a deposit betas as we are now starting to see interest rates moving up?\nAndrew Young: Sure. Moshe, it\u2019s Andrew. And recognizing that retail deposits are 85% of our portfolio, I will focus on that and over the last gosh six-ish years we had the falling rate cycle over the last couple where betas were right around 50% and then the last rising cycle, which was from the late 2015, I think, to early 2019, our cumulative beta was right around 40% and so betas are generally slow to rise over the first couple of hikes. But keep in mind is that last rising rate cycle we had eight hikes over 3.5 years, I believe it was, whereas in this cycle we could see four hikes that each equal 25 basis points and get up to 250 or 275 is forward suggest quite quickly. So I could make a case that industry betas will be higher or lower than that history. On the lower side there is elevated deposit balances across the industry, that loan-to-deposit ratios are quite low, industry NIMs are low and we are moving off a zero floor. But the flip side is the larger and quicker rate hikes, the possibility of some more aggressive pricing by institutions that are more reliant, on those funds to deposits to fund loan growth and institutional surge deposit run-off. So just want to give you a flavor of -- I think there is a lot that we are going to learn over the course of the next few months. But as we look at all and have a point estimate, that kind of run through all of our assumptions and our point estimate at this point is that, going to largely be in line with that rising, the last rising cycle of something like 40 basis points that starts-off a little slower and picks-up. But again they start-off slower might be a particularly condensed timeframe relative to what we saw in that last cycle.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Quick question on the outlook for the adjusted efficiency ratio from Q1 levels, and then, Rich, on Commercial Card issuing, can you talk about that business and I know it\u2019s -- you have been marketing I know in that small business Card, which has been sort of tough for banks to rollout?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Don, thank you. We have been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And the pandemic also accelerated technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and certainly in banking. And I think for every player the clock is ticking on their tech readiness and companies are waking up to the investment imperative. And we have talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is fierce is that I have seen in any time in my career and in any job family. So there is an urgency in responding to the marketplace. But I do want to also say that the fast-moving marketplace is also the creator of our opportunity and I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and that\u2019s why we are investing now. So really this is very similar message to what I said last quarter. What I have been saying for a long time, we are still very focused on the opportunity to drive operate -- operating efficiency improvement over the longer term. The engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains. But the timing of efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. So, but delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be an incredibly important north star to us and frankly one of the most important payoffs of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver long-term value. So I think you have sort of seen -- you can see some of the effects of what I am talking about in the first quarter operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter. So I think it\u2019s very similar conversation to what I was saying last time, we can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers, but the current pressure doesn\u2019t change at all, our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement.\nAndrew Young: Don, what was your question on Commercial?\nDon Fandetti: Yeah.\nRichard Fairbank: Oh! Sorry. Sorry.\nDon Fandetti: My question was\u2026\nRichard Fairbank: You wanted to...\nDon Fandetti: \u2026Rich, your outlook on commercial, I know, as you rollout of node limit small business Card, which has been tougher banks to do. I didn\u2019t know if maybe you are using the public cloud, just wanted to see your thoughts on that?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. So when you are talking about, yeah, Commercial you are talking about here in our business Card -- business Credit Card. You may have seen the ads on TV that talk about no preset spending limit that\u2019s more complicated way to just say in a sense, not a credit limit that gets hard wired. This is something that is you know, dynamically there isn\u2019t a credit line per say this is dynamic transaction underwriting in real time. It\u2019s a very hard thing to build. It\u2019s taken us years to get there and it\u2019s absolutely a -- one of the many, many benefits of the tech transformation we have done and the journey to the cloud in the building of modern applications in modern platforms. And so, I have always said to -- investors will often ask where can I see, where is the -- I want to reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money we have spent on that. And I have said, look, there is not going to be any one thing, that you point out and say, oh, my gosh, that\u2019s I now see everything. This is about this journey -- is a journey that when we -- when years ago when we kind of said, some day we would like to do this thing over here, some day we would like to do that. We would also like to have much better efficiency, we would like to better risk management, we would like to do lots of things and a striking thing was, all the things that we wanted to do, usually in life, they are -- you have to pick some and it\u2019s all about trade-offs. What I am struck by in this journey is a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do and that path relates to building modern technology across the company and from the bottom of the tech stack up and that is what we have done. And then over time, you as investors will see manifestations of that. See while that Auto Navigator product Capital One built that can underwrite every car in America and for any consumer in a fraction of the second that\u2019s striking and then one sees, well also -- you actually have a no preset spending limit that\u2019s striking. And we didn\u2019t do the journey for the sake of any one of those, but I think on an increasing basis, investors will see examples of things that are -- that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment we have made in technology. And things that also by themselves like this Card thing we are talking about is itself, within that journey that took a bunch of years. But it\u2019s all about working backwards from wins with customers and that\u2019s why we are doing that.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our final question this evening will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Thanks very much guys for fitting in my question. Rich, you talked a lot about credit in the strength of your customer base. Aside from that, that we are seeing you, call it, some of the more modern or emerging platforms, we are observing some delinquency drift there. And in fact, we are even seeing some reactions in the capital markets, some securitization deals are getting canceled or renegotiated as they go. I am wondering what do you ascribe that to and are there any reverberating effects from that type of development or migration into your business over time?\nRichard Fairbank: So, John, as I often say with the smile, Capital One was one of the original fintechs. We are a fintech -- before fintechs were word. But if you think about what we did is, we built a lending company, we started with Cards that we ultimately building a broad based financial institution. One thing that enabled that journey to happen is the advent of the capital markets and we were able to ride the very mediocre growth Capital One in the \u201890s based on securitizations and things and so we were very grateful for that. But at the same time we then did, probably one of the most things that I think most shocked our investors, I guess, it shocked because you spent a lot of years talking about it before we did it, but striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet, because we want to create much greater resilience in our funding. So the reason I mentioned that is, as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization, have an opportunity to grow quickly. But they also have a just an inherent structural challenge with resilience. So, for all of them, they need to and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that. I want to talk just a little bit about, you mentioned, some of the lending results and some of the uptick. So first of all, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see upticks and delinquencies just for companies in general, whether they are banks or some of the fintechs. Typically, companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror. I mean, for example, let\u2019s just say, that you created a fintech in the last couple of years, how would one look in the rear view mirror and determine where resilience is and where it isn\u2019t, since in general pretty much everybody did well. So that\u2019s one of the challenge any new company has is building deepen of credit history to do that. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s just a challenge they bring to the table, it\u2019s not their fault. There is nothing. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a structural thing. The other thing that always happens with normalization, as normalization tends to happen faster on front books than back books and so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is, if their high growth fintechs, just the proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different and it would be surprising if they didn\u2019t normalize faster, given that typically front books normalize faster than back books. And a lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them and that\u2019s also very helpful in normalization journey. So as one that was an original fintech, I have great fascination with the fintechs, lot of respect for a lot of things they are doing. But also know that, there is some structural things that they are going to have to confront that they and their investors will have to keep an eye on.\nJohn Hecht: Perfect.

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I will begin on slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. Our Domestic Card business posted strong year-over-year growth in every topline metric in the first quarter, as we continued our longstanding strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across the business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 26% year-over-year and up 47% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up $16.9 billion or about 19% year-over-year. Ending loans were down just 1% from the sequential quarter, better than the typical seasonal decline of around 7% and revenue was up 20% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans, as well as strong revenue margin. Domestic Card revenue margin for the first quarter was 18.3%. Revenue margin continued to benefit from spend velocity, which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth. Spend velocity is driven by the traction we are getting with heavy spenders. The margin also includes a gain from a Card partnership portfolio sale in the quarter. Credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.12%, a 42 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.32%, 8 basis points above the prior year. Gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 63 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 10 basis points. Non-interest expense was up 33% from the first quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $918 million in the quarter. Our choices in Domestic Card marketing are the biggest, but of course, not the only driver of total company marketing trends. We continue to see opportunities to book Domestic Card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continued to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our Domestic Card franchise. Consumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong, and in our own portfolio, credit results continued to be well below pre-pandemic levels and they are normalizing gradually. We are keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. And as always, we are underwriting to worsening scenarios, even as we lean into marketing. Our Domestic Card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decade long focus on heavy spenders continues to gain traction. We increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of Venture X. Growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses, which show up in our marketing expense and part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise with investments in our new travel portal and airport lounges. And looking across the whole company, our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like Capital One Shopping in our Card business and Auto Navigator in our Auto business. And modern technology infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digital first National Direct Banking strategy in Consumer Banking. We are marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses. Our marketing is paying-off across these opportunities. We posted very strong growth in Domestic Card purchase volume, new accounts and loans. We are gaining share and building a long-term franchise with heavy spenders. And away from the Card business, we are growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with Auto Navigator and our National Direct Banking business is winning with customers and driving growth. Speaking of our Auto and Retail Banking businesses, let's move to slide 12, which shows that strong loan growth in our Consumer Banking business continued in the first quarter. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased 14% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 14%. First quarter auto originations were up 33% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, auto originations were up 20%. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive year-over-year growth in our Auto business. We continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace. First quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 2% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue grew 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans, partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees. The year-over-year decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on booking higher quality loans within credit segment. Across the auto lending industry, the pace of price increases has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates. The decline in loan yields coupled with the pace of pricing changes has compressed margins in our Auto business. First quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of $126 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a net expense of $130 million. The allowance for credit losses in our Auto business was flat in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter. The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate are gradually normalizing, and remain strong and well below pre-pandemic levels. The charge-off rate for the first quarter was 0.66%, up 19 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 73 basis points year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 8 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 47 basis points. Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business, which delivered strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue in the quarter. First quarter ending loan balances were up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization. Average loans were up 15%. Ending deposits grew 9% from the first year, excuse me, from the first quarter of 2021, as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Quarterly average deposits increased 12% year-over-year. First quarter revenue was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was also up 16%. Commercial Credit performance remains strong. In the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 5.7% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 0.8%. In closing, we continued to drive strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We also posted strong Auto and Commercial growth. Credit is gradually normalizing and remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. Pulling way up, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity and it's the engine of enduring value creation over the long-term. And now, we will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Okay. Hey, Sanjay. Yeah. So let's just talk about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer continues to be strong. While the savings rate has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels, the cumulative impact of savings over the last two years is still a significant positive. We see this in higher bank account balances and higher household net worth and it is true across the income spectrum. Now, of course, the bulk of government stimulus is now behind us and most industry forbearance programs are winding down. But I think we will see some sustained benefits from consumer deleveraging through the pandemic. Debt servicing burdens are lower than they have been in decades, supported both by deleveraging and by low interest rates. On the other side of the consumer balance sheet, labor market demand remained strong. So in our own portfolio, Sanjay, we see continuing strength in roll rates, cure rates and recovery rates, and even as we see signs of normalization, our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any historical standard. There are emerging headwinds as well, for example, high price inflation. The inflation has the potential to erode the excess savings, consumers accumulated through the pandemic, especially of price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth and also higher interest rates would push debt servicing burdens back up. But if we pull up on the whole, I'd say consumers are in good shape coming out of the pandemic relative to most historical benchmarks. In fact, the -- I am just learned over the years that, I have got a lot of confidence in how -- what consumers learn from downturns and scares that they have and the choices that they make and I think we are just seeing very rational behavior by consumers. I worry more about markets and how competitors operate and lending practices and things like that, we can save that for another question. But we still feel good about the consumer and look it is a natural thing, it would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is. And so, normalization, the root word in normalization is nor, and there is quite a journey to really sort of an equilibrium place for credit performance. And one of the reasons that we are still leaning pretty hard into our growth opportunities is our confidence in the consumer and our read of the marketplace at this time. Yeah. Well, Sanjay, we as a company have been very focused on minimizing fees, just in general for our consumers. Obviously the overdraft announcement was a pretty dramatic case in point there. But even in the Card business, when you look, we really what Capital One has is an APR and a late fee and in some cases a cash advance fee, both of those fees are really to discourage certain behaviors that we don't think are in the interest of the consumer. So, yes, so our strategy has been to have pricing be upfront and have -- it be clear and very simple. Now late fees or something that we have continued to have late fees, because we wouldn't want our loved ones ending up paying late on their bill, so just late fee, I think is one of the natural fees that probably makes sense to have on a product. The fed is created a Safe Harbor with respect to late fees, maybe the industry well, that will be revisited and obviously we will watch that as we continue our business. Yeah. Hey, Bill. So we have for quite a long time saying, we should all expect normalization. In terms of what we see in normalization, I -- it's pretty early and pretty modest, in fact, if anything I guess, we would -- we are sort of struck by the how moderate the pace is, but we shouldn't necessarily count on that, but it is certainly striking so far. What we are seeing in normalization is really across the credit spectrum and across the income spectrum. It does seem that normalization is a bit more pronounced at the lower end of the market, if you sort of measure either in terms of income or credit score. But those are also populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic. So that's -- so I think we are seeing and we would expect this is and across the Boards kind of return toward normal over time. With respect to inflation, we worry a lot about inflation and that is something that, especially if inflation, as we have seen in, what it costs to live is faster than wage inflation. These can put pressures and sometimes can put pressures more on the -- in the Main Street America. And so it's something that we worry quite a bit about and I think that, it would be very natural for these inflation pressures to put more pressure on consumers. Yeah. Over the years, we have worked hard to originate accounts, and we have said, it's kind of a coiled spring of growth opportunity and we uncoil the spring gradually based on customer performance and also the marketplace. And so we have as part of the growth that you see, while it's being powered by very strong originations and in some return to spending in Card usage by the back book, we also have been selectively increasing credit lines. Nothing dramatic, but it's consistent with my earlier comments about the consumer, and again, with great demonstration by the performance of our customers, we have been selectively increasing credit lines and I think I don't see anything that would change our lean in that direction. Again, it's selective and it assumes a worsening environment, it assumes normalization in all of those things. So I don't think we would be setup to be surprised there and I don't see -- I don't have any conversations about trying to reverse that direction. Thanks, John. I have not -- look, recently a discretionary versus non-discretionary, so I don't want to speculate on that. I will tell you a thing that is -- certainly striking is what's happening with T&E spend these days. Just by way of comparison T&E spend was up 90%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, that was a very depressed quarter. But up around 20% from first quarter 2019 level. So there is a lot of -- I think would people sort of just bursting out and wanting to free themselves from some of what they have been through in the pandemic, we certainly see strength there. But I think your question about, as really inflation hits and we see just a lot of downstream effects that can happen from that, that certainly could impact Card spend. But I would say a lot of the traction that we have in Card spend is coming from our -- are really spender focused business, and frankly, heavy spender focused business and I think that, I am not sure that a change in inflation is going to have necessarily that much impact on the propensity of the heavy spenders to spend. Hey, Ryan. Okay. Ryan, I do have a smile at your comment, because often we have zagged while -- zig while others zag and we have -- you and I in fact have chatted about that and the reason sometimes behind it. Because it's not just an accident that sometimes has been our pattern, because part of what we are reading is the competitive marketplace and that has impact on the opportunity and on credit performance and selection dynamics and a lot of things. So your question is a great one, but I think a lot of companies out there to see the strength of the consumer. They are sort of feeling the consumer, sort of roaring back with respect to more normal activities. And I think people are leaning into to take advantage of that and certainly we are. But we -- let me talk a little bit just about the competition in the Card business. We certainly know that there is elevated marketing. All the companies are pretty much coming out and showing more marketing, talking about more marketing, so that is happening and we have a careful eye to see what that does to the opportunity that we are experiencing. But I will kind of come back to our opportunity there, but certainly marketing levels are elevated. Competition in the rewards space is probably a notch more intense than pre-pandemic levels, but it's pretty stable in recent quarters and not what I would call irrational. Certainly incredibly good players at the top of the market and there is a lot of competition there, but that hasn't really altered our view of the opportunity, either APRs generally been stable. Turning to the fintechs for a second, obviously we have seen a lot of, buy now pay later activity. I think that we should note that the fintechs who are in the lending business have been lending in the greatest rearview mirror of credit -- industry credit performance that you could ever imagine. And businesses like instalment lending based businesses sometimes are pretty sensitive in that environment. So I -- but we continue to see quite a bit of activity on fintechs as well. But on the Card side, before I turn to Auto, all -- we have an eye on the competition, I think generally the competition while intense is not unreasonable, we have not seen the big changes in people's underwriting policy, the kinds of things that -- we haven't seen dramatic changes in pricing. So I think it's more, I would label it at the intense level that we would expect that a time like this, but not unreasonable and not something that would cause us to move off our pretty strong lean into the growth opportunity. So in the Auto business, let me just talk a little bit about this. The competition in the Auto business continues to remain intense. It's showing up across the Board from credit unions, big banks and small independent lenders, and it's playing out across all Credit segments. And you just kind of double-click into that for a second, credit unions that have been wash with deposits, they have been gaining significant share, consistent with what we have observed during prior cycles and especially as interest rates go up a little bit. And let's talk in fact about rising interest rates. I think it's almost always the case in business that when in a sense a cost of goods sold rises, there typically is a lag and how that makes it way into consumer pricing. What we have -- as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we have not seen the marketplace, the auto marketplace yet respond in terms of pricing relative to what's actually happening to interest rates, so there is a some compression there. I think typically what we have seen in the past is competitors respond with differing speeds to interest rate increases. So sometimes players like credit unions tend to and maybe they have different FTP methodologies or whatever it tend to be sort of the slowest to respond, but we -- so we will have to keep an eye on that. But I think that, we are really excited about our opportunity in the Auto business. The technology products that we have out there are really cutting edge and getting a huge amount of traction. Our -- I is just very careful on the pricing out there and also just whether there is an over exuberance relative to the number of planets that are aligned in the auto lending business, particularly what sort of happened to used car values and is -- and in fact that still there, just keep an eye on whether that industry can remain as rational as it's been in the last couple of years. Hi. Good evening, Betsy. So, Betsy, we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base and while lately it's been sort of flattening out if you will, I mean, payment rates are just well above pre-pandemic levels. And while not a perfect proxy, you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in March remained close to 50%. One of the more recent drivers of higher repayment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and healthy consumer balance sheets and we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize, maybe you know it's kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect. And I certainly believe payment rates will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit. So over time, the normalization of credit plausibly leads to some normalization of higher payment -- of normal, excuse me, a payment rate. I think there is another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet, behind our payment rate numbers and that is that each year we are gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders. Also you may remember for years we talked about, gosh, this goes all the way back to the Great Recession, Capital One's systematic avoidance of high balance revolvers, which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times, but is a move for the sake of resilience. But I think this sort of systematic effects of avoiding high balance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our payment rate as well. But, certainly, probably, the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments. Well, yeah, let me just -- why don't I do this, Betsy, let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had. There are few things driving our marketing levels higher these days. First of all, the opportunities that we see. We are seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and we are leaning hard into them while the opportunities are there. In our Card business, we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we are originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation, which is enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and enable customized solutions. So we are seeing significant traction in originations across our business. And I want to note that, so much of our Card business overall and our growth is in our Branded Card franchise, as opposed to co-brand and private label partnerships. And by the way we also like those businesses, but for Capital One that's a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And in Branded Card, we enjoy the full economics of the business and we own the customer franchise. So while the industry doesn't track data on this, I think, our share growth in Branded Card s is particularly noteworthy. And Branded Card is, of course, as the word implies, it's about our brand and we continue to invest in the company's brand and in the flagship products. And some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from having so much Branded Card, where we own all the economics. But the flip side of that is that, the marketing and the brand building are entirely on us and that all shows up in our marketing numbers. But that's an absolute centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise. Now second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction we are getting in our more than decade long journey, to drive more and more our market with a focus on the heavy spenders. So we launched our venture Card way back in 2010 and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders. But it hasn't just been about flagship Card s, it's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and that's about great products with heavy reward content, it's about great servicing, it's about customer experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles, and of course, an exceptional digital experience. So for years we have been on this journey and every year we have had growing traction and while our whole franchise of spenders has grown nicely, we have grown even faster with heavier spenders. And with each year of success we have had the license to stretch a little higher up market and we are continuing to invest to make that possible. And lately, you have seen our launch of our travel portal which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace. You have seen the launch of airport lounges, which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent travelers. And last fall, we launched Venture X, which moved us into the next tier of premium Card s. And that launch has been very successful and we continue to invest in the growth of that product. You can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase volume growth that we have had. Over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods, you will find Capital One with -- posting really high in your top of the league tables, if not at the top of the league tables purchase volume growth. And also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our Branded Card s and that's why you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin. This journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional Card business. It has higher upfront cost, brand building, higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions, and of course, investment in high end experiences. But long-term value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high spend levels, strong margins, very low losses, low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our franchise. So the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance and that's a continuing long-term benefit of these investments. I just want to mention the third factor contributing to the higher marketing, if some of the traction that we are getting with our new digital offerings, including Auto Navigator, Capital One Shopping and our National Bank. And just to comment on the National Bank, which unlike Capital One, unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank acquisitions, we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically, which of course, does take marketing investment. So that was just, take me a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing that you are seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it. Now, due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest, those quest being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move up market. This has -- these things are contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days. So that is -- that sort of a pulling out sort of a narrative on why it is that we are leaning hard into marketing and it's a combination of sort of the opportunity at the moment, as well as capitalizing on the journey that's been many years in the making. Typically, we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year. An important contributor to our marketing was things related to that, for example, the launch of venture Card s, early spend bonuses and things like that. So things are not -- it's not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years. We are not specifically giving a guidance on the rest of the year, but I just wanted to share with you, why it is that we are leaning in the marketing, what's driving that and I am -- as you can probably tell from the answer, I am really enthused about our opportunities and we are though leaning into take advantage of them and a lot of that is about marketing. Yeah. So, Moshe, with respect to the lower end consumers, it's less about, let's imagine we don't have to do very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one, where the consumers in a more challenged place where the competitors are -- have gone a whole notch more aggressive. And what I think is more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big dial back say in origination machines. So we just more cautious online, try to continue to build the franchise, maybe not as aggressively as sometimes. But, again, we have over our 30 years, Moshe, in building sort of Main Street franchise, really do a lot of the regulating and things on the loan side . On heavy spenders we continued to find so much traction and what I have often said about the quest for heavy spenders, unlike a lot of things that I have seen in our business journey, this is not a thing that is very well suited to a blitz here a pullback of blitz and a pull back. Now, that doesn't mean we wouldn't be dialing the knobs up and down, on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever. But this is and I think there is a reason that not very many players are really, really successful at the top of the market. This is about really building a franchise at that end of the market. That's not just taking regular consumer products and addressing them up with more rewards or the fancy advertising and the -- that's why, I mentioned, this journey that were like in the 12th year of the journey where we declared we are going to just keep moving up market. One can't do it overnight. It's something you have to earn along the way. But all of our metrics continue to show traction and success, traction on brand metrics as well, and pretty much all the customer metrics, you have seen what's happening on purchase volumes, the -- when we track, the things that we have booked over the years we sort of love the annuities we are booking. So that to me is something that we are going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time. But what we will -- the things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices, certain product choices, but that one, that I partly shared -- I want to share this a little bit more about this today that that's a journey that Capital One has been on as part of our central part of our strategy in Card for a lot of years. Okay. Don, thank you. We have been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And the pandemic also accelerated technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and certainly in banking. And I think for every player the clock is ticking on their tech readiness and companies are waking up to the investment imperative. And we have talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is fierce is that I have seen in any time in my career and in any job family. So there is an urgency in responding to the marketplace. But I do want to also say that the fast-moving marketplace is also the creator of our opportunity and I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and that's why we are investing now. So really this is very similar message to what I said last quarter. What I have been saying for a long time, we are still very focused on the opportunity to drive operate -- operating efficiency improvement over the longer term. The engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains. But the timing of efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. So, but delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be an incredibly important north star to us and frankly one of the most important payoffs of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver long-term value. So I think you have sort of seen -- you can see some of the effects of what I am talking about in the first quarter operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter. So I think it's very similar conversation to what I was saying last time, we can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers, but the current pressure doesn't change at all, our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement. Oh! Sorry. Sorry. You wanted to... Yeah. So when you are talking about, yeah, Commercial you are talking about here in our business Card -- business Credit Card. You may have seen the ads on TV that talk about no preset spending limit that's more complicated way to just say in a sense, not a credit limit that gets hard wired. This is something that is you know, dynamically there isn't a credit line per say this is dynamic transaction underwriting in real time. It's a very hard thing to build. It's taken us years to get there and it's absolutely a -- one of the many, many benefits of the tech transformation we have done and the journey to the cloud in the building of modern applications in modern platforms. And so, I have always said to -- investors will often ask where can I see, where is the -- I want to reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money we have spent on that. And I have said, look, there is not going to be any one thing, that you point out and say, oh, my gosh, that's I now see everything. This is about this journey -- is a journey that when we -- when years ago when we kind of said, some day we would like to do this thing over here, some day we would like to do that. We would also like to have much better efficiency, we would like to better risk management, we would like to do lots of things and a striking thing was, all the things that we wanted to do, usually in life, they are -- you have to pick some and it's all about trade-offs. What I am struck by in this journey is a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do and that path relates to building modern technology across the company and from the bottom of the tech stack up and that is what we have done. And then over time, you as investors will see manifestations of that. See while that Auto Navigator product Capital One built that can underwrite every car in America and for any consumer in a fraction of the second that's striking and then one sees, well also -- you actually have a no preset spending limit that's striking. And we didn't do the journey for the sake of any one of those, but I think on an increasing basis, investors will see examples of things that are -- that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment we have made in technology. And things that also by themselves like this Card thing we are talking about is itself, within that journey that took a bunch of years. But it's all about working backwards from wins with customers and that's why we are doing that. So, John, as I often say with the smile, Capital One was one of the original fintechs. We are a fintech -- before fintechs were word. But if you think about what we did is, we built a lending company, we started with Cards that we ultimately building a broad based financial institution. One thing that enabled that journey to happen is the advent of the capital markets and we were able to ride the very mediocre growth Capital One in the \u201890s based on securitizations and things and so we were very grateful for that. But at the same time we then did, probably one of the most things that I think most shocked our investors, I guess, it shocked because you spent a lot of years talking about it before we did it, but striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet, because we want to create much greater resilience in our funding. So the reason I mentioned that is, as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization, have an opportunity to grow quickly. But they also have a just an inherent structural challenge with resilience. So, for all of them, they need to and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that. I want to talk just a little bit about, you mentioned, some of the lending results and some of the uptick. So first of all, we shouldn't be surprised to see upticks and delinquencies just for companies in general, whether they are banks or some of the fintechs. Typically, companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror. I mean, for example, let's just say, that you created a fintech in the last couple of years, how would one look in the rear view mirror and determine where resilience is and where it isn't, since in general pretty much everybody did well. So that's one of the challenge any new company has is building deepen of credit history to do that. So I'd say that's just a challenge they bring to the table, it's not their fault. There is nothing. It's just -- it's a structural thing. The other thing that always happens with normalization, as normalization tends to happen faster on front books than back books and so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is, if their high growth fintechs, just the proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different and it would be surprising if they didn't normalize faster, given that typically front books normalize faster than back books. And a lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them and that's also very helpful in normalization journey. So as one that was an original fintech, I have great fascination with the fintechs, lot of respect for a lot of things they are doing. But also know that, there is some structural things that they are going to have to confront that they and their investors will have to keep an eye on."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide three of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter Capital One earned $2.4 billion or $5.62 per diluted common share. The results include one notable item, $192 million gain from the sale of two Card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter. Period end loans held for investment grew 1% on a linked-quarter basis and average loans grew 3%. Revenue in the linked-quarter increased 1%. Non-interest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by declines in both marketing and operating expenses. Provision expense in the quarter was $677 million, as net charge-offs of $767 million were partially offset by an allowance release. Turning to slide four, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. For the total company we released $119 million of allowance in the first quarter and the total allowance balance now stands at $11.3 billion. We continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties. Our total company coverage ratio is now 4%. Turning to slide five, I will discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments. As you can see in the graph, our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments. In our Total Card segment, the allowance balance declined $65 million, driven by our international Card businesses. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance remained flat at $8 billion. With the slight decline in ending loans, the flat allowance balance in Domestic Card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to 7.38%. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $16 million, which when coupled with loan growth resulted in a 10 basis point decline in coverage to 2.37%. And in Commercial, the $41 million decline in allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement. The decline in coverage ratio was driven by both the allowance release, as well as growth. Turning to page six, I will now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 140%. The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. The investment portfolio ended the quarter at $89 billion, declining by about $6 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Rising rates drove a market value decline of $4.3 billion, with the remaining decline due to our continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic. Turning to page seven, I will cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.49%, 50 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 11 basis points lower than Q4. Relative to a year ago, the increase in NIM is largely driven by a balance sheet shift, as we deployed excess cash to loans. The linked-quarter decrease in NIM was driven by having two fewer days in the first quarter. Normalizing for day count effect, higher yields in both our Card business and in our investment portfolio were roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields. Outside of quarterly day count, the NIM from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix, interest rates and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas. Turning to slide eight, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7% at the end of the first quarter, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases, the impact of the CECL transition and higher risk weighted assets. Recall that the phasing of CECL transition relief began on January 1st. We recognize 25% of our $2.4 billion total after-tax phasing amount in the first quarter. Also in the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion of common stock as part of the $5 billion share authorization that our Board approved in January. Earlier this month, in addition to approving our CCAR 2022 submission and our capital plan, our Board of Directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional $5 billion of common stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Yeah. Rick, it's Andrew. I mean, we disclosed the overall gains between the two portfolios of $192 million. The two portfolios combined, you saw probably last year when they got marked held for sale were roughly $4 billion, but below the surface there we are not going to get into specifically the run rate of revenue or the expenses associated with that in part, because we are growing the rest of the portfolio and you are going to see partnership businesses come in and out over time. Well, John, when you quote the -- this is Andrew, by the way. When you quote the reserve level, keep in mind that there pretty significantly different reserve levels by asset class and so the total company level, of course, is influenced by that mix. So I would suggest we decompose it a bit by each of them since auto was a little bit below where it was on CECL day one and that's largely a function of the elevated used car prices, our mix in prime. So we are seeing loss rates that are much below, I think, 66 basis points was the number this quarter. And so all else equal, you would expect that our coverage ratio there would be well below, what it was at adoption and yet, it's only a little bit below and that's for the qualitative factors there. But the largest factor to the total company reserve will clearly be Card. And that's one where I think it's always helpful to just start with a reminder of how that allowance is constructed, because answering your question is really dependent on a number of assumptions, where quite frankly your guess could be as good as mine. And so with Card, the first thing that goes into the allowance is just the expectation of future losses and recoveries and you can see within our delinquency bucket in the near-term, but beyond that, we assume that there is a relatively swift normalization of losses from those unusually strong levels, historically strong. The second is the size of the balance sheet, which he saw this quarter is growing at a quite healthy pace when you normalize quarter-over-quarter for seasonal effects and certainly up 19%, I think the number is in Q1 for Card relative to a year ago. And then the third input is that level of qualitative factors and that's really just to account for a variety of risks related to inflation and various things that are impacting that and just uncertainty in the more macro economy. And so the future allowance is really going to be determined by how all of those effects net out. The one thing that I will just remind you is, what we call the quarter swap effect and that is as credit begins to normalize, we will be replacing a currently low loss quarter with a slightly higher loss quarter, so that's another thing that will create pressure, all else equal. But if favorable credit trends continue and the factors driving those qualitative reserve subside, we could see the allowance be down to flat. But if normalization plays out and we are growing at a significant clip, I wouldn't anticipate that we will see allowance release, in fact, I can see allowance build. So it's really just a function of all of those factors. Sorry for the long-winded technical answer there, but I just think all of those factors are really important for you to understand, because the range of outcome on the allowance is quite large. Hey, Ryan. Yeah. I recall that in January, we did not have an active program at the time, so our Board authorized $5 billion and capital levels were even higher than they are today at that point. And so earlier this month in conjunction with the approval of the capital plan in our CCAR submission they authorized an additional $5 billion, which coincides with the capital plan and therefore would be available at the start of the third quarter. But in terms of the pace of that activity, it feels a little bit different than it did when we were at 14.5% over a year ago. To your point like asymptotically we are sort of heading towards 11% and so the pace of repurchases is as always is going to be dependent on our primary use of capital for loan growth and then the dividends. But beyond that, we are going to keep a really close eye on just the level of capital and earnings and growth and end market dynamics and take advantage of the fact that we are able to operate under the SCB framework and maintain that flexibility. So nothing specific in terms of the timeline there, but just wanted to be clear about the approvals when we announced it a few weeks ago. Hi, Betsy. Sure. Moshe, it's Andrew. And recognizing that retail deposits are 85% of our portfolio, I will focus on that and over the last gosh six-ish years we had the falling rate cycle over the last couple where betas were right around 50% and then the last rising cycle, which was from the late 2015, I think, to early 2019, our cumulative beta was right around 40% and so betas are generally slow to rise over the first couple of hikes. But keep in mind is that last rising rate cycle we had eight hikes over 3.5 years, I believe it was, whereas in this cycle we could see four hikes that each equal 25 basis points and get up to 250 or 275 is forward suggest quite quickly. So I could make a case that industry betas will be higher or lower than that history. On the lower side there is elevated deposit balances across the industry, that loan-to-deposit ratios are quite low, industry NIMs are low and we are moving off a zero floor. But the flip side is the larger and quicker rate hikes, the possibility of some more aggressive pricing by institutions that are more reliant, on those funds to deposits to fund loan growth and institutional surge deposit run-off. So just want to give you a flavor of -- I think there is a lot that we are going to learn over the course of the next few months. But as we look at all and have a point estimate, that kind of run through all of our assumptions and our point estimate at this point is that, going to largely be in line with that rising, the last rising cycle of something like 40 basis points that starts-off a little slower and picks-up. But again they start-off slower might be a particularly condensed timeframe relative to what we saw in that last cycle. Don, what was your question on Commercial?"

Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everybody. I'll start on Slide 3 of today's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $706 million or $1.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.9 billion or $11.95 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter was a $289 million accrual for our current estimate of the FDIC special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, fourth-quarter earnings per share were $2.24 and full-year earnings per share were $12.52. On a linked-quarter basis, growth in our Domestic Card business drove period-end loans up 2% and average loans up 1%. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC-insured deposits grew to 82% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by both higher net interest and non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 18% in the quarter. Operating expense increased 15%, with roughly half of that increase driven by the FDIC special assessment. The full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, improved 99 basis points to 43.54%. Provision expense was $2.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $326 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $326 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately $15.3 billion as of December 31. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.77%, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of card assets. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Outside of interest rates, most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the coverage ratio decreased by 16 basis points to 7.63%. The allowance balance increased by $336 million. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the loan growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance was essentially flat at roughly $2 billion. Coverage increased by 4 basis points to 2.71%, driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the coverage ratio declined by 3 basis points to 1.71%. The allowance decreased by $37 million, primarily driven by the charge-offs of office real-estate loans in the quarter. We have included additional details on the office portfolio on Slide 17 of tonight's presentation. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $2.3 billion to about $121 billion. The increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by modestly lower cash balances. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43.3 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 167%, up from 155% in the third quarter. The increase in the LCR was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.73%, 4 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by a continued mix-shift towards card loans and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.9%, approximately 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Asset growth, common and preferred dividends, and the share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew. Good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the domestic card business remained strong, even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $16 billion or about 12% year-over-year. Average loans increased 14%. And fourth-quarter revenue was also up 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 213 basis points year-over-year to 5.35%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end increased 118 basis points from the prior year to 4.61%. On a sequential-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 95 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points. For the month of December, the charge-off rate was 5.78%, including a one-time impact of 15 basis points, described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8-K. Adjusted for this impact, the monthly charge-off rate for December would have been 5.63%. Pulling up on Domestic Card credit, we believe that normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized. The 30-plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now. Since August, our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in 2018 and 2019. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January as delinquency entries in December indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in January. We've always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where charge-offs are going. Charge-off rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about three to six months. Based on the stability, we've seen in our delinquencies since August and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates, we believe the charge-off rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about 15% above 2019 levels. I give this window, because investors have been asking for quite some time when will charge-offs level off. So this is the point where we see that happening, meaning charge-offs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months. This window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets which have stabilized, and our recoveries which have also stabilized and started to rebuild. This isn't designed to be longer-run guidance but rather to indicate that charge-offs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term. In the longer run, there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred charge-offs from the pandemic and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventory. Non-interest expense was up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1.25 billion for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year. Our choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. And in the fourth quarter, marketing also included higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. Slide 12 shows fourth-quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth-quarter auto originations declined 7% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis ending loans were down 2%. We posted another strong quarter of year-over-year growth in federally insured consumer deposits. Fourth-quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $26 billion or 9% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%, average deposits were up 11% year-over-year, and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are FDIC-insured. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 17% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.19%, up 53 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 6.34%, up 72 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 42 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 70 basis points. Both of these linked-quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations. Monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results. On a monthly basis auto delinquency rate and charge-off rate had been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of 2023 and continued to do so through December. Slide 13 shows fourth-quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked-quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 9% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 7%. The declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14 basis point linked-quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits. Fourth-quarter revenue was down 5% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also down about 5%. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 28 basis points from the third quarter to 0.53%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.81%, up 73 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 6 basis points to 0.84%. Commercial Banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio. Slide 17 of the fourth-quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. We posted another strong quarter of top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic card and auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns, a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results. We grew consumer deposits and total deposits. And we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Our annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments for the full year 2023, was 43.54%. In 2023, we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99 basis point improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio. The actual improvement was better than the \u201cmodest improvement\u201d growth we had been expecting. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology. And we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full-year 2024, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming that rule takes effect in October 2024. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We continue to drive improvements in underwriting, modeling, and marketing, as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. And our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement, and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well-positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We\u2019ll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. So if you have any questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. And, Rich, thank you for the color on the charge-offs. I know you cited the pluses and minuses from here, from stabilizing charge-offs. But I'm curious if you feel like the consumer positioning leans towards improvement here as inflation declines, real income growth has resumed. And should interest rates come down? This coupled with the recoveries could benefit the charge-off rate, correct? And I'm just thinking sort of how to think about the reserve rate going forward.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. So, Sanjay, yeah -- so first of all, my comments, I just want -- I wanted with my credit comments in my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets, I really wanted to share where our charge-offs are settling out, which is about 15% above 2019 levels. And we should also note, by the way, that in any year first-half losses are seasonally higher than second-half losses. So within any normal year, the first half is the peak. Now, as I said, we're not really giving longer-run guidance. But let's think about the dynamics about how things could go from here. From an economy point of view, we're certainly in a strong economy, unemployment is at a pretty remarkable place. So, I think if anything, unemployment could add more downside than it adds upside. Perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside. But I don't have any more insight to those than anybody else does. I think, I also would want to kind of reinforce your point, there are two good guys that should play out over time. And we've been talking for a long time about the delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. And when you think about that the pandemic had such a just absolutely unusual experience for consumers, with all of the stimulus and the forbearance and so on that, we certainly have believed that charge-offs that were otherwise going to happen at that time, some got averted permanently, but I think some got delayed. And so this phenomenon that we call delayed charge-offs, I think, it's not a really quantifiable effect, but I think it's very much been a part of what's happening with -- in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course. And the other thing is recoveries. So recoveries -- our recoveries, while the rate per charge-off dollar remained strong, the number of charge-off dollars in inventory, thanks to the pandemic, were at a really depressed level. And so we have bottomed out there and they're starting to -- now inventories are starting to increase, of course, as credit has normalized and that should also gradually be a good guy. Also when I look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make, these are consistent with longer-term losses that are lower than where we are now. So we consciously sort of focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out. And then there is a list of forces that could work in either direction, but I think you certainly point out to some of the good guys.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, just a follow-up. Maybe, Andrew, could you just talk about the reserve rate on a go-forward basis and how we should think about it? Should it stabilize? Can it come down? And maybe just also on the NIM with rates coming down, how we should think about the movement over the course of the year? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Sure. Sanjay, let me compartmentalize those two things, NIM will be a whole separate answer, but with respect to allowance. Well, let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item, which is a reminder that in Q4 we have seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage. So the coverage ratio in Q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic and it reverses itself in Q1, but again a real modest effect there. Longer-term though, projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage. And as we've said before, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that and Rich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there. So from a reserve perspective, every quarter we're just going to be looking at the next 12 months of projected losses with the first six more consequential in the calculation, but also far more predictable, given the visibility that we have through delinquencies. And then the remainder of that window really informed by economic assumptions, and then the reversion to the long-term average. And so over the last few quarters, things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what we've expected and you've seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat. So, I think it's important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release, we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance, but eventually in a scenario like that, after a period of coverage stability like we've seen, you would see coverage coming down in the release of non-growth related reserves.\nSanjay Sakhrani: NIM?\nAndrew Young: NIM, sure. There is a lot of factors at play with NIM and maybe I'll do the same housekeeping with NIM. Just to remind everyone that in the first quarter with one fewer day, we're going to see roughly a 7 basis points headwind there. But let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to NIM. On the tailwind side, growth in card balances as percentage of the balance sheet and even within those balances possibly a higher revolver rate. Certainly a tailwind, and that's something we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And then also a lower cash balance, we've talked about this before, but cash balances today in total of $43 billion. I think the number is with about $37 billion at the Fed is quite a bit higher than pre-pandemic. I don't think we'll get back to where we were pre-pandemic but I would expect over time that, that will come down from today's level. So that would also be a tailwind to NIM. On the headwind side, even though the Fed has stopped moving up in July, we continue to see some deposit product rotation, and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas. And then even if the Fed starts decreasing rates, we're going to see the assets reprice more quickly than the deposits. And the competitive environment in the backdrop of QT will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle. So that would create a bit of marketing pressure. And then a couple of other things that I would just highlight as potential headwinds, the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income as well as just the path of credit. You've seen suppression go up over the last few quarters, as losses go up, so that also creates some pressure to NIM. So, I know that that was a list of puts and takes, but I partially go into that level of detail to say, it's kind of hard to say where NIM is going to go in the near term, especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point, but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play. But over the much longer term, I would say there's nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was pre-pandemic, that leads me to believe that NIM will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening, everyone.\nAndrew Young: Hey, Ryan.\nRichard Fairbank: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Rich, when I look you put about $4 billion of marketing expense for the second straight year and you continuing to drive strong growth, we're hearing about some others with a little bit of a more cautious tone on growth. So maybe just talk about, are you leaning in and do you expect marketing to increase, and really where you're seeing the best opportunities in the market and how are you thinking about growth looking ahead? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, Ryan. We feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace, so we are leaning in, we're definitely leaning in. The -- you can see obviously, there was quite a lot of marketing in the fourth quarter, but we continue to see opportunities across the Board, especially in the card business. But -- so let -- just pulling up there a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize. First of all, we're just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business. We're making -- we have over the last number of years, made some, what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges. Lately, there is really even not a lot of trimming around those edges, we're in a very sort of stable place with respect to the business we're going after, the results we're getting, and the deal that we have to capitalize on that. And I think our technology transformation of course has really been beneficial, but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine-learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investment and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way. So just the overall opportunities continue to be very strong. The second part of our marketing investment, of course, relates to our quest to win at the top of the market. And we've been going after heavy spenders now for almost 15 years and that needs sustained high levels of investment and you can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products, in groundbreaking experiences, like things like best-in-class digital customer experiences, really high level elite customer servicing, online travel portal, and -- in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market. The incredible importance of advanced fraud defense is to ensure that the card always works. And increasingly, we're also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplace, such as airport lounges and access to select properties. So we continue to lean into growth here and obviously, that quest toward the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful long-lasting fabulous annuities. And the third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our National Bank. And just as a reminder, we have a smaller branch footprint, and so we lean more heavily on our technology investments, our digital experiences, our cafe network, and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this National Bank. And we are really pleased with the traction there. And it's been a lot of years in the making, but we are definitely leaning in there and loved the results. So, Ryan, those are kind of a window into how we're thinking about it in the compelling opportunities behind across the board that we see and we are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And, Rich, if you put late fees aside for the first part of my question, you talked about stable to modest improvement which ex-late fees would imply continued improvement on the operating efficiency. Do you think we're back ex-late fees on a sustained journey of improving efficiency, like you were talking about before the pandemic? And then second, just how are you thinking about the timing of offsetting late fees? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Thank you. So the -- our story about efficiency, I think, has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years and I think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness. And we certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business, but really it's been about building a business model powered by technology and the customer experiences we're building to drive revenue growth and efficiency and both at the same time. And we've talked about how so much of this is powered by technology and we continue to see the benefits of that. So we -- at this, on the one hand, keep leaning into technology and keep investing there. And on the other hand, see a -- growing opportunities to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investments. So, pulling way up, while any particular year can be different from overall trends. We continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment we're making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency. So, did you have a CFPB question? Yes. So let me turn, Ryan, to talk about that. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. While the CFPB's proposal has not been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon. And once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule. This litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year and maybe longer. You saw we talked about an estimate of October. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term relative to what our path would have been. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact, a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. And these choices include changes to our policies, our products, and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect and a few are already underway, many will come after the rule change takes effect.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was hoping you talk a little bit about the auto business. You continue to kind of pull back a little bit from that side, thinking about how you're feeling about potentially increasing some originations. Still a healthy amount of originations at $27 billion this year, but just wondering when you might make a pivot there.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Arren. So, we've been cautious in auto for a couple of years now. We've noted over this period of time, a number of headwinds in the business. So -- but let's tally them up. Margin pressure from the interest-rate cycle, normalizing credit, vehicle values normalizing from their all-time highs, and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rate and still high car prices0. As you know we don't work backward from growth target and we remain disciplined in our originations, setting pricing and terms that we're comfortable with and then take what the market gives us. So back in 2022, we raised price, tightened our credit box at the low end of the market, and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending. As a result, our run rate of originations has been lower than like two years ago. But as a result of our actions, we've been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations. The credit performance has been really striking, which of course you can see. So even as vehicle values continue to normalize, risk on our most recent originations from 2023 remains below what we saw in our pre-pandemic originations, probably is the result of our actions. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. The margins on new originations have improved as well, particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks. So we feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations. So we continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks. But of course, that's what we always do. But when we think about some of the headwinds, I think some of those headwinds are easing, and the results that we're seeing on our own books are really pretty striking and gratifying. So, that gives us a more bullish outlook, still with a note of caution.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Hey, Rich, you've given some framework for charge-offs into '24. One of the observations we would make is that delinquencies even through December on a year-over-year basis due are trending, are up on a year-over-year basis, even though that increase has slowed substantially. That suggests and very consistent with your description that charge-offs will continue to rise through the first half of the year. What I'm curious about is, given that delinquencies are still up 100 basis points or 115 basis points year-over-year in December, when we look into the second half of the year, I understand, seasonally, that they will be down. But would you expect the charge-offs in the second half of the year will still be up versus '23?\nRichard Fairbank: So, I think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks. As our focus here is about stability, so we're really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to. And that really leads us back to 2019, 2018. And so let me just sort of speak in that, sort of double-click a little bit into my comments on that. So our delinquencies are above pre-pandemic levels, but they've been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time. And now, compared to 2019, since August we're running around 17% above the level for the same month of 2019. Compared to 2018, since May, we're running at around 13% above the level for the same months of 2018. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January of 2024, as well based on delinquency entries in December and that looks like it's going to be another month of stability. So, we feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized. And of course, delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance. Our charge-offs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of 2023. But at this point, what we're declaring here is that our charge-offs are leveling off as well. Now, there's more month-to-month volatility in charge-offs than in delinquencies by quite a bit. Because every data point of delinquencies includes five months of delinquency inventories. And of course, charge-offs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket. And there was also some noise in the fourth quarter of 2019, that makes it less reliable as a charge-off benchmark. So, we actually think 2018 is an even better benchmark for our charge-offs, for comparing our charge-offs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year. In the fourth quarter, our net charge-offs were about 15% above 2018 levels. And of course, 2018 rolled into 2019, so that's an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into 2024 and compared to 2019. Now when we look ahead, extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates, we conclude that our net charge-offs are stabilizing at about 15% above 2019, with of course some typical month-to-month volatility and normal seasonality. Now, of course, the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in 2020 and 2021. Coming out the pandemic, we were concerned about two trends. FinTechs were flooding the market, especially the subprime market with credit offers, creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations. We also anticipated that pandemic era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that these would revert over time. So, we tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then. And the result has been striking, that with all the kind of changes, the normalization, all the noise over the last number of years, that there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages. In our -- basically and our post-pandemic originations, each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other. And also, relatively consistent with pre-pandemic vintages. And over time, this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends. And as we've looked at this, we said these are very good shoulders to stand on, to have that much stabilization for so long. We of course all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing. Another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate. And unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall charge-off rate running above pre-pandemic levels. And this is of course because of the very low level of charge-offs over the past three years. And therefore, we had a low level of raw material for future recovery. And by the way, just a Capital One point here, this is a larger effect for us and for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime, not all at once like in a debt sale. And so, we\u2019ve recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up. And that's our -- and you know, and now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild, that's of course a good guy, although it's coming from a pretty low level. And this also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized. So when you -- to your question where you at compared to 2023, what we've really done is really kind of anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in sort of recent experience, 2018 and 2019. And since we've seen delinquencies and charge-offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks, we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out, is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years. And so we are entering 2024 now with a real sense of stability and we've benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Maybe, Rich, just following up on that, I think that a lot of the marketing dollars in the card space have been spent, with the -- at the transactor business. But given that, that's -- that stability that you're talking about. And I assume the bulk of the dollars of loss, delinquency and loss are coming from kind of the lower end of the card spectrum. So does that mean that that's an area for expansion in 2024, like, how should we think about that? And I do have a follow-up.\nRichard Fairbank: Sorry, Moshe, are you saying, is what -- is the lower-end an area for expansion?\nMoshe Orenbuch: Yes.\nRichard Fairbank: So, we feel -- well, we feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card and also the relative health of the consumer. And you've known us for a long time, Moshe, as long as we have -- for the decades we've been talking together, you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace. And we -- let's just reflect on this for a second. If you're talking about subprime credit cards, this is a complex business that requires deep investment in information-based underwriting. And of course, we've spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures and sort of honing the analytical and the operating and underwriting and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise, but also with the number one and two and three most important things to us has been resilient as we do this. And what's really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years, through the Great Recession and following that. And if we -- and we've talked about how the lower-end of the marketplace, whether you're talking, by the way, there's a whole -- when you talk about the lower end of the marketplace, obviously, we -- there is a whole part of the marketplace that Capital One doesn't serve. But in terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve, if you look at either income or FICO and look at the normalization that's going on, we've seen very solid curing in that part of the market. It in fact even started -- it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market but the curing story, the leveling-off story we're talking about today is absolutely across the board. I do want to say though also, Moshe, relative to your point, you've had Fintechs who we were very concerned about flooding that end of the market. Some years ago, they certainly have massively dialed back. And I think that the continued -- when we see the success of our vintages, the stabilization, now the sort of stabilization overall of Capital One's whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace, I think that we like the opportunities we see there, Moshe, and we will be leaning into that.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean, you've talked in the past about not just the financial impact of the late fee, but also its deterrent impact. So how do you think about that in terms of the resilience of that segment as we go forward post any changes to late fees? And maybe just as a side point, you did mention that you thought you could maintain -- improve the efficiency ratio even with the late fee. I mean, that just seems -- that seems like a -- like you\u2019d have to take a couple $100 million out of expenses to do that. So if there is a way to talk about what -- how that would happen, and tack that on to the answer, that would help too. Thanks.\nAndrew Young: So, Moshe, Capital One has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace, strikingly simple products. Because we, from sort of a mission and strategy point of view, we believe so much in this, but -- and we've built a brand over having very simple products. And so things like, for example, on the banking side, no minimum balance requirements, no membership fees, and even no overdraft fees. So here we are a company that has really, really reduced the fees. But if we add one fee left, I think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee. Because to your point, it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer. And an analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket. I think that if a speeding ticket were -- let's say, we had an $8 speeding ticket, I'm not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if we're really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people, that really is the role of the fee. We've been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers when the late payment due alerts, with the goal of trying to -- not trying to maximize late fees, but actually trying to maximize the on-payment performance of our customers. So, Moshe, this is a question that -- we've been worried about your question about the what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals and it's something that we're just going to have to. If this CFPB rule goes into effect, we're all going to experience together sort of this -- not controlled experiment, but we certainly mark us down for having a concern about that. But from a financial point of view, obviously, the late fees are an important thing on the P&L. And as I've talked about, we have created, I've said it many actions across different types of things from policies, products, pricing structures, investment choices to claw back the very significant economic impact. Some of those things are underway. Some of them just to mention it, by the way. By the time we get there when the rule is announced, some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company and the majority will still be waiting to happen. With respect to the fourth quarter, the [\u201825] (ph) is the big full-year effect, obviously something coming in late in the fourth -- it's something coming in, in our estimate in the fourth quarter. It doesn't have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio, but it still does have an impact. So, essentially, what's implied underneath it, is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio, behind the flat to modestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Hi, thanks for taking my call. In the interest of time, given its late in the call, I'll ask my two parter all upfront here. First on the marketing side, I know you indicated you expect to continue to lean in on marketing this year, does that -- what does that imply on how you're thinking about full-year marketing expense? I mean, could that mean that you will see marketing come in above the $4 billion level that you saw this year or could it be stable or a modest decline? And then my second question is on the credit side, on the commercial real estate office CRE. I know you had some lumpy losses this quarter and some pressure still in criticized and non-accruals. If you could just give us a little bit more color there in terms of what you charged-off and your outlook on that front? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay, John, thanks for your good questions here. We don't typically give full-year marketing guidance. And the reason is because, marketing depends of course a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there. So what I wanted to just share in response to Ryan Nash's question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the real-time numbers we're seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that. And then also the sort of more structural investments that we're making in the business, particularly with respect to the -- going after the heavy spenders. So, we don't have full-year guidance, but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see.\nAndrew Young: And then, John, on the office side, it's virtually impossible to generalize office, it is incredibly property-specific. We've talked in the past about us having a fair amount in gateway cities and having a mix of both A and B, C properties. But frankly, the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties. And so what we saw in the quarter was a little more than $80 million of losses tied to office loans. We continue to not originate there. Balances have come down to -- about $2.3 billion, I think, down about $150 million in the quarter. It's less than 1% of our total loans. But as we charged off in the quarter, we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount, and then we built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around 13%.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: Rich, you've made a lot of progress on heavy spenders. As you sort of look out, where are we I guess on that expense cycle? Are we sort of still looking at many years of acceleration or do you hit some type of level where there is some scale kicking in? Just trying to get a sense on where we are on that investment cycle.\nRichard Fairbank: Well, Don, it's certainly, I think the quest to the heavy spender -- to win in the heavy spenders of the marketplace, it will be a quest as far out as we can see. In the same way, it is for the players who -- the small number of players who are really going after that business. The key part of it is, we're getting more and more scale along the way. So you've seen over the years, the growth in purchase volume, what you don't see as is the purchase volume growth rates by level of spender. And it -- any segmentation we've been looking at, it monotonically -- the growth rate is monotonically faster. The more you go up, the -- toward the heavy spenders. So it's just indicating, we're getting a lot of traction there. So, I wouldn't want to say that we just have to do a blitz, and then we're kind of done with the investment. The way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business, even including the largest, continue to invest in that business. But we're really pleased with the traction and that's why we continue to invest.\nDon Fandetti: That's all I had. Thanks.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. I appreciate all of the very clear commentary on what you're seeing in credit. There is a view that if we'd had a mild recession and experienced the purging of weaker credits, that would have provided a clear runway for growth coming out of that. But instead, the environment we're in is arguably a little bit muddier and some would stay still late cycle. Could you speak to that dynamic, Rich, and whether that weighs on how you're thinking about growth from here in any way? And as a follow-up, I'll just ask it now for you, Andrew. Can you update us on how you're thinking about capital return from here?\nAndrew Young: Sure. Why don't I start? Bill, look, at this point, there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital, not the least of which is the end-game proposal. We're all aware there is been quite a bit of advocacy there and that there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land, including things like the impact of AOCI and phase-in and ops risk and other forces at play. So we are -- you know as much as we do, and we're waiting to see what the final rule holds there. But in addition to that, we're coming up on CCAR, we don't yet have the scenarios for this year. You look back at how impactful the scenario as well as the starting balance sheet is to those outcomes. You've seen our SCB fluctuate over the last four years, from I think 10.1% down to 7%, and now we're sitting here at 9.3%. So waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what CCAR will hold. And then in addition, we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections. And finally, just point to the economy, there is -- the consensus view is growing of a soft landing, but there is still quite a wide range of outcomes there. And so given all of those factors, we've chosen to operate for the last few quarters around 13%. We recognize that, when we feel like we're in an excess capital position, that returning it is one way to create value. And under the SCB framework, we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically and we'll use that flexibility when we think it's prudent to do so.\nRichard Fairbank: Bill, comment on our continuing to lean in, given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle, so it's certainly a great question. So there -- first of all, the bottom line is, we are continuing to lean in. Obviously we keep a wary eye out for things that could change. But I sort of start with the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. And the labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year, really defining the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards, again despite rising interest rates. Home prices are back and doing a bit better and are generally near all-time highs. In aggregate, consumers across all income levels still have excess savings also from the pandemic, although those numbers are declining. Inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years. Student loan repayments, now they resumed in October, but there is the 12-month on-ramp period and a new income-driven repayment plan, which will significantly reduce payments for lower-income borrowers. So, on the whole, I'd say, consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. Then if we look inside our own portfolio, we still see higher average payments compared to 2019 by segment, by a really pretty sizable delta. We -- and then we then look at the marketplace. And you've seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry. And we pulled back in ways that we haven't pulled back in the card business. But I think we see a rationale and stable competitive marketplace, it's very competitive, but it's rationale and stable. And then most importantly, the results themselves. The -- our vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages. The trimming around the edges that we've done over the last few years have really I think allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying, not as good performance of -- in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past, but we have that real stability. Then we see the leveling-off of our portfolio. And really we talk about our charge-offs leveling off at a level that -- like 15% above 2019. It's interesting actually that's net charge-offs, but gross charge-offs are leveling-off very close to the gross charge-off levels of 2018 and 2019. And actually, the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that we've had for as a -- in the wake of the inventory of recoveries being so much lower inventory of charge-off debt. So pulling way up and seeing the traction in our business, the success with our brand, the things that for competitive reasons we don't share in the marketplace, but the traction on the tax side, in terms of enabling us to create better -- really unique customized customer experiences, totally customized underwriting. The reaching to marketing channels that we hadn't even tapped before. All of this is putting us in a position to continue to -- pulling way up, obviously in the credit business, we always worry a lot. But if I calibrate this relative to a lot of other times, I feel really quite good about this. And I actually said I felt a lot less good a couple of years ago. Because I felt that the pandemic, while, from a credit point of view, who couldn't like those credit results, I said, it actually is so abnormally good. The marketplace won't be able to help itself but create unusual practices, unresilient underwriting, et cetera. So, actually what we've had, if I can borrow the soft landing term from the economy conversations is kind of a soft landing, relative to the credit business, and landing is really quite the right word, relative to Capital One, which I think really as I've kind of declared today, sort of landed here. And I know some competitors still haven't fully landed, but pulling way up on this. I actually feel this is really quite a good time if I calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, great. Thanks so much for all the color on the call today. I just have two questions. Rich, what are you seeing you think that's making the net charge-off stabilize 15% above 2019 levels? Is there something in the consumer payment behavior that's changed? Is there something you think that shifted the consumer, in general, where the credit card industry may be seeing a higher through-the-cycle net charge-off rate going forward or for Capital One in particular? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.\nRichard Fairbank: So, I actually believe that what we're really seeing here is a credit situation that's very similar to pre-pandemic. It is showing up right now and I'm going to speak through the Capital One lens. I think I'm not going to universalize for the industry. But as I mentioned in the -- to the prior answer there, that if you look at gross charge-offs, where they're settling out for Capital One, now this is Capital One that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last -- a fair amount of trimming around the edges. I think we also did a very important choice that I'm not sure was universe, it might have been an unusual choice. But when we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers, much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance, we sort of became alarmed about credit scores, great inflation if you will, and essentially intervened in our models to normalize. So that we didn't get fooled by that. But yes, this is the -- and so as a result of that, we have stabilized. We're probably one of the first players to stabilize and we have stabilized at this moment at 15%, above 20% -- say, benchmark to 2019 levels. Already we said that number from a gross charge-off number is really sort of very close to 2019 levels. So the recoveries effect, which is a temporary effect that our recoveries are so much lower because they just don't have as much inventory of charge-offs to collect on. That's a good guy that should help over time. So, I think also as we've talked about and we've talked about ever since the pandemic sort of -- we started coming out the other side of the pandemic, we said there is another effect. Let's call it the delayed charge-off effect, that if you think about all those charge-offs that would have happened -- many of that would have happened in the pandemic, but didn't. Some of them may have gotten reprieved for the long run, but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge-off over time. And that is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing. It's not -- we have ways that we try to measure it, but nobody can precisely measure this. But this is also something that leads to an elevation of charge-offs relative to probably what's an equilibrium. So if I speak from Capital One's point of view, our guidance was to guide you to the leveling-off. Because of the lower recoveries effect right now, that's leveling off at 15% above 2019. The underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me, to what was there in the past. I think there, even as we keep a wary eye on the economy, there is some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business and all the other things being equal. That can help the credit metrics more and more show that they're strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic. So pulling way up, I don't think, and again, I'll speak, I don't think things have shifted. I think we're seeing some trends playing out, but for Capital One we're -- we feel great about where we have stabilized and we see really good -- a good assessment of our future.\nJeff Norris: Well, thank you very much everyone for joining us on the conference call tonight, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team is available this evening to answer further questions if you have them. Have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the domestic card business remained strong, even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 4% from the fourth quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $16 billion or about 12% year-over-year. Average loans increased 14%. And fourth-quarter revenue was also up 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 213 basis points year-over-year to 5.35%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end increased 118 basis points from the prior year to 4.61%. On a sequential-quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 95 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points. For the month of December, the charge-off rate was 5.78%, including a one-time impact of 15 basis points, described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8-K. Adjusted for this impact, the monthly charge-off rate for December would have been 5.63%. Pulling up on Domestic Card credit, we believe that normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized. The 30-plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now. Since August, our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in 2018 and 2019. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January as delinquency entries in December indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in January. We've always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where charge-offs are going. Charge-off rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about three to six months. Based on the stability, we've seen in our delinquencies since August and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates, we believe the charge-off rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about 15% above 2019 levels. I give this window, because investors have been asking for quite some time when will charge-offs level off. So this is the point where we see that happening, meaning charge-offs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months. This window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets which have stabilized, and our recoveries which have also stabilized and started to rebuild. This isn't designed to be longer-run guidance but rather to indicate that charge-offs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term. In the longer run, there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred charge-offs from the pandemic and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventory. Non-interest expense was up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1.25 billion for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year. Our choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. And in the fourth quarter, marketing also included higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. Slide 12 shows fourth-quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth-quarter auto originations declined 7% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis ending loans were down 2%. We posted another strong quarter of year-over-year growth in federally insured consumer deposits. Fourth-quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $26 billion or 9% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%, average deposits were up 11% year-over-year, and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are FDIC-insured. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 17% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.19%, up 53 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 6.34%, up 72 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 42 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 70 basis points. Both of these linked-quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations. Monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results. On a monthly basis auto delinquency rate and charge-off rate had been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of 2023 and continued to do so through December. Slide 13 shows fourth-quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked-quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 9% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 7%. The declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14 basis point linked-quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits. Fourth-quarter revenue was down 5% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was also down about 5%. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the fourth quarter increased 28 basis points from the third quarter to 0.53%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.81%, up 73 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate was down 6 basis points to 0.84%. Commercial Banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio. Slide 17 of the fourth-quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter. We posted another strong quarter of top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume, and loans. Domestic card and auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns, a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results. We grew consumer deposits and total deposits. And we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Our annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments for the full year 2023, was 43.54%. In 2023, we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99 basis point improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio. The actual improvement was better than the \u201cmodest improvement\u201d growth we had been expecting. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology. And we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full-year 2024, we expect annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, will be flat to modestly down compared to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming that rule takes effect in October 2024. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We continue to drive improvements in underwriting, modeling, and marketing, as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. And our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement, and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well-positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Yeah. So, Sanjay, yeah -- so first of all, my comments, I just want -- I wanted with my credit comments in my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets, I really wanted to share where our charge-offs are settling out, which is about 15% above 2019 levels. And we should also note, by the way, that in any year first-half losses are seasonally higher than second-half losses. So within any normal year, the first half is the peak. Now, as I said, we're not really giving longer-run guidance. But let's think about the dynamics about how things could go from here. From an economy point of view, we're certainly in a strong economy, unemployment is at a pretty remarkable place. So, I think if anything, unemployment could add more downside than it adds upside. Perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside. But I don't have any more insight to those than anybody else does. I think, I also would want to kind of reinforce your point, there are two good guys that should play out over time. And we've been talking for a long time about the delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. And when you think about that the pandemic had such a just absolutely unusual experience for consumers, with all of the stimulus and the forbearance and so on that, we certainly have believed that charge-offs that were otherwise going to happen at that time, some got averted permanently, but I think some got delayed. And so this phenomenon that we call delayed charge-offs, I think, it's not a really quantifiable effect, but I think it's very much been a part of what's happening with -- in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course. And the other thing is recoveries. So recoveries -- our recoveries, while the rate per charge-off dollar remained strong, the number of charge-off dollars in inventory, thanks to the pandemic, were at a really depressed level. And so we have bottomed out there and they're starting to -- now inventories are starting to increase, of course, as credit has normalized and that should also gradually be a good guy. Also when I look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make, these are consistent with longer-term losses that are lower than where we are now. So we consciously sort of focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out. And then there is a list of forces that could work in either direction, but I think you certainly point out to some of the good guys. Hey, Ryan. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. We feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace, so we are leaning in, we're definitely leaning in. The -- you can see obviously, there was quite a lot of marketing in the fourth quarter, but we continue to see opportunities across the Board, especially in the card business. But -- so let -- just pulling up there a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize. First of all, we're just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business. We're making -- we have over the last number of years, made some, what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges. Lately, there is really even not a lot of trimming around those edges, we're in a very sort of stable place with respect to the business we're going after, the results we're getting, and the deal that we have to capitalize on that. And I think our technology transformation of course has really been beneficial, but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine-learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investment and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way. So just the overall opportunities continue to be very strong. The second part of our marketing investment, of course, relates to our quest to win at the top of the market. And we've been going after heavy spenders now for almost 15 years and that needs sustained high levels of investment and you can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products, in groundbreaking experiences, like things like best-in-class digital customer experiences, really high level elite customer servicing, online travel portal, and -- in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market. The incredible importance of advanced fraud defense is to ensure that the card always works. And increasingly, we're also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplace, such as airport lounges and access to select properties. So we continue to lean into growth here and obviously, that quest toward the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful long-lasting fabulous annuities. And the third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our National Bank. And just as a reminder, we have a smaller branch footprint, and so we lean more heavily on our technology investments, our digital experiences, our cafe network, and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this National Bank. And we are really pleased with the traction there. And it's been a lot of years in the making, but we are definitely leaning in there and loved the results. So, Ryan, those are kind of a window into how we're thinking about it in the compelling opportunities behind across the board that we see and we are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it. Yeah. Thank you. So the -- our story about efficiency, I think, has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years and I think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness. And we certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business, but really it's been about building a business model powered by technology and the customer experiences we're building to drive revenue growth and efficiency and both at the same time. And we've talked about how so much of this is powered by technology and we continue to see the benefits of that. So we -- at this, on the one hand, keep leaning into technology and keep investing there. And on the other hand, see a -- growing opportunities to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investments. So, pulling way up, while any particular year can be different from overall trends. We continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment we're making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency. So, did you have a CFPB question? Yes. So let me turn, Ryan, to talk about that. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. While the CFPB's proposal has not been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon. And once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule. This litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year and maybe longer. You saw we talked about an estimate of October. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term relative to what our path would have been. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact, a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. And these choices include changes to our policies, our products, and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect and a few are already underway, many will come after the rule change takes effect. Thanks, Arren. So, we've been cautious in auto for a couple of years now. We've noted over this period of time, a number of headwinds in the business. So -- but let's tally them up. Margin pressure from the interest-rate cycle, normalizing credit, vehicle values normalizing from their all-time highs, and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rate and still high car prices0. As you know we don't work backward from growth target and we remain disciplined in our originations, setting pricing and terms that we're comfortable with and then take what the market gives us. So back in 2022, we raised price, tightened our credit box at the low end of the market, and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending. As a result, our run rate of originations has been lower than like two years ago. But as a result of our actions, we've been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations. The credit performance has been really striking, which of course you can see. So even as vehicle values continue to normalize, risk on our most recent originations from 2023 remains below what we saw in our pre-pandemic originations, probably is the result of our actions. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. The margins on new originations have improved as well, particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks. So we feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations. So we continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks. But of course, that's what we always do. But when we think about some of the headwinds, I think some of those headwinds are easing, and the results that we're seeing on our own books are really pretty striking and gratifying. So, that gives us a more bullish outlook, still with a note of caution. So, I think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks. As our focus here is about stability, so we're really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to. And that really leads us back to 2019, 2018. And so let me just sort of speak in that, sort of double-click a little bit into my comments on that. So our delinquencies are above pre-pandemic levels, but they've been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time. And now, compared to 2019, since August we're running around 17% above the level for the same month of 2019. Compared to 2018, since May, we're running at around 13% above the level for the same months of 2018. And at this point, we have a pretty good window into January of 2024, as well based on delinquency entries in December and that looks like it's going to be another month of stability. So, we feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized. And of course, delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance. Our charge-offs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of 2023. But at this point, what we're declaring here is that our charge-offs are leveling off as well. Now, there's more month-to-month volatility in charge-offs than in delinquencies by quite a bit. Because every data point of delinquencies includes five months of delinquency inventories. And of course, charge-offs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket. And there was also some noise in the fourth quarter of 2019, that makes it less reliable as a charge-off benchmark. So, we actually think 2018 is an even better benchmark for our charge-offs, for comparing our charge-offs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year. In the fourth quarter, our net charge-offs were about 15% above 2018 levels. And of course, 2018 rolled into 2019, so that's an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into 2024 and compared to 2019. Now when we look ahead, extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates, we conclude that our net charge-offs are stabilizing at about 15% above 2019, with of course some typical month-to-month volatility and normal seasonality. Now, of course, the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in 2020 and 2021. Coming out the pandemic, we were concerned about two trends. FinTechs were flooding the market, especially the subprime market with credit offers, creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations. We also anticipated that pandemic era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that these would revert over time. So, we tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then. And the result has been striking, that with all the kind of changes, the normalization, all the noise over the last number of years, that there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages. In our -- basically and our post-pandemic originations, each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other. And also, relatively consistent with pre-pandemic vintages. And over time, this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends. And as we've looked at this, we said these are very good shoulders to stand on, to have that much stabilization for so long. We of course all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing. Another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate. And unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall charge-off rate running above pre-pandemic levels. And this is of course because of the very low level of charge-offs over the past three years. And therefore, we had a low level of raw material for future recovery. And by the way, just a Capital One point here, this is a larger effect for us and for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime, not all at once like in a debt sale. And so, we've recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up. And that's our -- and you know, and now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild, that's of course a good guy, although it's coming from a pretty low level. And this also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized. So when you -- to your question where you at compared to 2023, what we've really done is really kind of anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in sort of recent experience, 2018 and 2019. And since we've seen delinquencies and charge-offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks, we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out, is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years. And so we are entering 2024 now with a real sense of stability and we've benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks. Sorry, Moshe, are you saying, is what -- is the lower-end an area for expansion? So, we feel -- well, we feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card and also the relative health of the consumer. And you've known us for a long time, Moshe, as long as we have -- for the decades we've been talking together, you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace. And we -- let's just reflect on this for a second. If you're talking about subprime credit cards, this is a complex business that requires deep investment in information-based underwriting. And of course, we've spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures and sort of honing the analytical and the operating and underwriting and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise, but also with the number one and two and three most important things to us has been resilient as we do this. And what's really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years, through the Great Recession and following that. And if we -- and we've talked about how the lower-end of the marketplace, whether you're talking, by the way, there's a whole -- when you talk about the lower end of the marketplace, obviously, we -- there is a whole part of the marketplace that Capital One doesn't serve. But in terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve, if you look at either income or FICO and look at the normalization that's going on, we've seen very solid curing in that part of the market. It in fact even started -- it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market but the curing story, the leveling-off story we're talking about today is absolutely across the board. I do want to say though also, Moshe, relative to your point, you've had Fintechs who we were very concerned about flooding that end of the market. Some years ago, they certainly have massively dialed back. And I think that the continued -- when we see the success of our vintages, the stabilization, now the sort of stabilization overall of Capital One's whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace, I think that we like the opportunities we see there, Moshe, and we will be leaning into that. Okay, John, thanks for your good questions here. We don't typically give full-year marketing guidance. And the reason is because, marketing depends of course a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there. So what I wanted to just share in response to Ryan Nash's question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the real-time numbers we're seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that. And then also the sort of more structural investments that we're making in the business, particularly with respect to the -- going after the heavy spenders. So, we don't have full-year guidance, but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see. Well, Don, it's certainly, I think the quest to the heavy spender -- to win in the heavy spenders of the marketplace, it will be a quest as far out as we can see. In the same way, it is for the players who -- the small number of players who are really going after that business. The key part of it is, we're getting more and more scale along the way. So you've seen over the years, the growth in purchase volume, what you don't see as is the purchase volume growth rates by level of spender. And it -- any segmentation we've been looking at, it monotonically -- the growth rate is monotonically faster. The more you go up, the -- toward the heavy spenders. So it's just indicating, we're getting a lot of traction there. So, I wouldn't want to say that we just have to do a blitz, and then we're kind of done with the investment. The way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business, even including the largest, continue to invest in that business. But we're really pleased with the traction and that's why we continue to invest. Bill, comment on our continuing to lean in, given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle, so it's certainly a great question. So there -- first of all, the bottom line is, we are continuing to lean in. Obviously we keep a wary eye out for things that could change. But I sort of start with the health of the consumer. I think the US consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. And the labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year, really defining the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates. Consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards, again despite rising interest rates. Home prices are back and doing a bit better and are generally near all-time highs. In aggregate, consumers across all income levels still have excess savings also from the pandemic, although those numbers are declining. Inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years. Student loan repayments, now they resumed in October, but there is the 12-month on-ramp period and a new income-driven repayment plan, which will significantly reduce payments for lower-income borrowers. So, on the whole, I'd say, consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. Then if we look inside our own portfolio, we still see higher average payments compared to 2019 by segment, by a really pretty sizable delta. We -- and then we then look at the marketplace. And you've seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry. And we pulled back in ways that we haven't pulled back in the card business. But I think we see a rationale and stable competitive marketplace, it's very competitive, but it's rationale and stable. And then most importantly, the results themselves. The -- our vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages. The trimming around the edges that we've done over the last few years have really I think allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying, not as good performance of -- in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past, but we have that real stability. Then we see the leveling-off of our portfolio. And really we talk about our charge-offs leveling off at a level that -- like 15% above 2019. It's interesting actually that's net charge-offs, but gross charge-offs are leveling-off very close to the gross charge-off levels of 2018 and 2019. And actually, the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that we've had for as a -- in the wake of the inventory of recoveries being so much lower inventory of charge-off debt. So pulling way up and seeing the traction in our business, the success with our brand, the things that for competitive reasons we don't share in the marketplace, but the traction on the tax side, in terms of enabling us to create better -- really unique customized customer experiences, totally customized underwriting. The reaching to marketing channels that we hadn't even tapped before. All of this is putting us in a position to continue to -- pulling way up, obviously in the credit business, we always worry a lot. But if I calibrate this relative to a lot of other times, I feel really quite good about this. And I actually said I felt a lot less good a couple of years ago. Because I felt that the pandemic, while, from a credit point of view, who couldn't like those credit results, I said, it actually is so abnormally good. The marketplace won't be able to help itself but create unusual practices, unresilient underwriting, et cetera. So, actually what we've had, if I can borrow the soft landing term from the economy conversations is kind of a soft landing, relative to the credit business, and landing is really quite the right word, relative to Capital One, which I think really as I've kind of declared today, sort of landed here. And I know some competitors still haven't fully landed, but pulling way up on this. I actually feel this is really quite a good time if I calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey. So, I actually believe that what we're really seeing here is a credit situation that's very similar to pre-pandemic. It is showing up right now and I'm going to speak through the Capital One lens. I think I'm not going to universalize for the industry. But as I mentioned in the -- to the prior answer there, that if you look at gross charge-offs, where they're settling out for Capital One, now this is Capital One that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last -- a fair amount of trimming around the edges. I think we also did a very important choice that I'm not sure was universe, it might have been an unusual choice. But when we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers, much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance, we sort of became alarmed about credit scores, great inflation if you will, and essentially intervened in our models to normalize. So that we didn't get fooled by that. But yes, this is the -- and so as a result of that, we have stabilized. We're probably one of the first players to stabilize and we have stabilized at this moment at 15%, above 20% -- say, benchmark to 2019 levels. Already we said that number from a gross charge-off number is really sort of very close to 2019 levels. So the recoveries effect, which is a temporary effect that our recoveries are so much lower because they just don't have as much inventory of charge-offs to collect on. That's a good guy that should help over time. So, I think also as we've talked about and we've talked about ever since the pandemic sort of -- we started coming out the other side of the pandemic, we said there is another effect. Let's call it the delayed charge-off effect, that if you think about all those charge-offs that would have happened -- many of that would have happened in the pandemic, but didn't. Some of them may have gotten reprieved for the long run, but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge-off over time. And that is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing. It's not -- we have ways that we try to measure it, but nobody can precisely measure this. But this is also something that leads to an elevation of charge-offs relative to probably what's an equilibrium. So if I speak from Capital One's point of view, our guidance was to guide you to the leveling-off. Because of the lower recoveries effect right now, that's leveling off at 15% above 2019. The underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me, to what was there in the past. I think there, even as we keep a wary eye on the economy, there is some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business and all the other things being equal. That can help the credit metrics more and more show that they're strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic. So pulling way up, I don't think, and again, I'll speak, I don't think things have shifted. I think we're seeing some trends playing out, but for Capital One we're -- we feel great about where we have stabilized and we see really good -- a good assessment of our future."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon everybody. I'll start on Slide 3 of today's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $706 million or $1.67 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $4.9 billion or $11.95 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter was a $289 million accrual for our current estimate of the FDIC special assessment. Net of this adjusting item, fourth-quarter earnings per share were $2.24 and full-year earnings per share were $12.52. On a linked-quarter basis, growth in our Domestic Card business drove period-end loans up 2% and average loans up 1%. Period-end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC-insured deposits grew to 82% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by both higher net interest and non-interest income. Non-interest expense was up 18% in the quarter. Operating expense increased 15%, with roughly half of that increase driven by the FDIC special assessment. The full-year operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments, improved 99 basis points to 43.54%. Provision expense was $2.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $326 million. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $326 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately $15.3 billion as of December 31. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.77%, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of card assets. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Outside of interest rates, most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the coverage ratio decreased by 16 basis points to 7.63%. The allowance balance increased by $336 million. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the loan growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance was essentially flat at roughly $2 billion. Coverage increased by 4 basis points to 2.71%, driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the coverage ratio declined by 3 basis points to 1.71%. The allowance decreased by $37 million, primarily driven by the charge-offs of office real-estate loans in the quarter. We have included additional details on the office portfolio on Slide 17 of tonight's presentation. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $2.3 billion to about $121 billion. The increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by modestly lower cash balances. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $43.3 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior quarter. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 167%, up from 155% in the third quarter. The increase in the LCR was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our fourth quarter net interest margin was 6.73%, 4 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by a continued mix-shift towards card loans and higher asset yields, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.9%, approximately 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Asset growth, common and preferred dividends, and the share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure. Sanjay, let me compartmentalize those two things, NIM will be a whole separate answer, but with respect to allowance. Well, let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item, which is a reminder that in Q4 we have seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage. So the coverage ratio in Q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic and it reverses itself in Q1, but again a real modest effect there. Longer-term though, projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage. And as we've said before, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that and Rich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there. So from a reserve perspective, every quarter we're just going to be looking at the next 12 months of projected losses with the first six more consequential in the calculation, but also far more predictable, given the visibility that we have through delinquencies. And then the remainder of that window really informed by economic assumptions, and then the reversion to the long-term average. And so over the last few quarters, things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what we've expected and you've seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat. So, I think it's important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release, we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance, but eventually in a scenario like that, after a period of coverage stability like we've seen, you would see coverage coming down in the release of non-growth related reserves. NIM, sure. There is a lot of factors at play with NIM and maybe I'll do the same housekeeping with NIM. Just to remind everyone that in the first quarter with one fewer day, we're going to see roughly a 7 basis points headwind there. But let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to NIM. On the tailwind side, growth in card balances as percentage of the balance sheet and even within those balances possibly a higher revolver rate. Certainly a tailwind, and that's something we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And then also a lower cash balance, we've talked about this before, but cash balances today in total of $43 billion. I think the number is with about $37 billion at the Fed is quite a bit higher than pre-pandemic. I don't think we'll get back to where we were pre-pandemic but I would expect over time that, that will come down from today's level. So that would also be a tailwind to NIM. On the headwind side, even though the Fed has stopped moving up in July, we continue to see some deposit product rotation, and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas. And then even if the Fed starts decreasing rates, we're going to see the assets reprice more quickly than the deposits. And the competitive environment in the backdrop of QT will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle. So that would create a bit of marketing pressure. And then a couple of other things that I would just highlight as potential headwinds, the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income as well as just the path of credit. You've seen suppression go up over the last few quarters, as losses go up, so that also creates some pressure to NIM. So, I know that that was a list of puts and takes, but I partially go into that level of detail to say, it's kind of hard to say where NIM is going to go in the near term, especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point, but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play. But over the much longer term, I would say there's nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was pre-pandemic, that leads me to believe that NIM will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today. Hey, Ryan. So, Moshe, Capital One has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace, strikingly simple products. Because we, from sort of a mission and strategy point of view, we believe so much in this, but -- and we've built a brand over having very simple products. And so things like, for example, on the banking side, no minimum balance requirements, no membership fees, and even no overdraft fees. So here we are a company that has really, really reduced the fees. But if we add one fee left, I think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee. Because to your point, it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer. And an analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket. I think that if a speeding ticket were -- let's say, we had an $8 speeding ticket, I'm not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if we're really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people, that really is the role of the fee. We've been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers when the late payment due alerts, with the goal of trying to -- not trying to maximize late fees, but actually trying to maximize the on-payment performance of our customers. So, Moshe, this is a question that -- we've been worried about your question about the what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals and it's something that we're just going to have to. If this CFPB rule goes into effect, we're all going to experience together sort of this -- not controlled experiment, but we certainly mark us down for having a concern about that. But from a financial point of view, obviously, the late fees are an important thing on the P&L. And as I've talked about, we have created, I've said it many actions across different types of things from policies, products, pricing structures, investment choices to claw back the very significant economic impact. Some of those things are underway. Some of them just to mention it, by the way. By the time we get there when the rule is announced, some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company and the majority will still be waiting to happen. With respect to the fourth quarter, the [\u201825] (ph) is the big full-year effect, obviously something coming in late in the fourth -- it's something coming in, in our estimate in the fourth quarter. It doesn't have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio, but it still does have an impact. So, essentially, what's implied underneath it, is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio, behind the flat to modestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect. And then, John, on the office side, it's virtually impossible to generalize office, it is incredibly property-specific. We've talked in the past about us having a fair amount in gateway cities and having a mix of both A and B, C properties. But frankly, the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties. And so what we saw in the quarter was a little more than $80 million of losses tied to office loans. We continue to not originate there. Balances have come down to -- about $2.3 billion, I think, down about $150 million in the quarter. It's less than 1% of our total loans. But as we charged off in the quarter, we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount, and then we built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around 13%. Sure. Why don't I start? Bill, look, at this point, there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital, not the least of which is the end-game proposal. We're all aware there is been quite a bit of advocacy there and that there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land, including things like the impact of AOCI and phase-in and ops risk and other forces at play. So we are -- you know as much as we do, and we're waiting to see what the final rule holds there. But in addition to that, we're coming up on CCAR, we don't yet have the scenarios for this year. You look back at how impactful the scenario as well as the starting balance sheet is to those outcomes. You've seen our SCB fluctuate over the last four years, from I think 10.1% down to 7%, and now we're sitting here at 9.3%. So waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what CCAR will hold. And then in addition, we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections. And finally, just point to the economy, there is -- the consensus view is growing of a soft landing, but there is still quite a wide range of outcomes there. And so given all of those factors, we've chosen to operate for the last few quarters around 13%. We recognize that, when we feel like we're in an excess capital position, that returning it is one way to create value. And under the SCB framework, we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically and we'll use that flexibility when we think it's prudent to do so."

Now I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion, or $4.45 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.5 billion were up 7% compared to the second quarter and 17% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our domestic card business. Period end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, while average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits ended the quarter at 80% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4%, driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income. Non-interest expense increased 1% in the quarter, as higher marketing expense was partially offset by lower operating expense. Provision expense was $2.3 billion with $2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $322 million. Turning to Slide 4. I'll cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $322 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $15 billion as of September 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.75%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Relative to last quarter's assumptions underlying the allowance, the baseline forecast in this quarter for most key economic variables improved. However, we continue to assume several key economic variables worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $349 million. The coverage ratio was largely flat at 7.79%. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the growth in loans. The positive impact from the modestly improved economic outlook was largely offset by the impact of replacing the lost content of the third quarter of 2023 with a 12-month reasonable and supportable period that now includes the third quarter of 2024. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $136 million. The improved economic outlook and a decline in loan balances drove the release. And in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $97 million. The build reflected the impact of rising interest rates and other factors on certain commercial real estate and corporate borrowers, including our commercial office portfolio. On Slide 17 in the appendix, we have included additional details on the office portfolio. I'll also note that in the third quarter, we completed the sale of approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio that were previously marked as held for sale. The commercial -- the coverage ratio in the Commercial business increased by 12 basis points and now stands at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 155%, up from 150% last quarter and 139% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter were largely flat at $118 billion. Higher cash balances were offset by a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, up about $3 billion from the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 21 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by higher card yields, a continued mix shift towards card loans and one additional day in the quarter, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13%, approximately 30 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases we completed in the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. The domestic card business posted another strong quarter of year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 6% from the third quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $19 billion or about 16% year-over-year and third quarter revenue was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 18.24%. The decline was driven by two factors: First, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin; and second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in revolve rate. On a linked quarter basis, the revenue margin increased seasonally by 48 basis points. Domestic Card credit results continue to normalize from the historically strong results we saw during the pandemic, consistent with our expectations. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 220 basis points year-over-year to 4.4%. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 4.31%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was essentially flat and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 57 basis points. Both the monthly delinquency rate and the monthly charge-off rate are now modestly above 2019 levels. Our delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of '22 -- of 2022. Total company marketing expense of $972 million for the quarter was also relatively flat year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, marketing increased 10%. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation and our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. As a result, we are leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We expect fourth quarter marketing will be seasonally higher. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, auto originations declined 10% year-over-year, driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.4 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another strong quarter in year-over-year retail deposit growth. Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $34 billion or 13% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 7% year-over-year driven by the higher rate paid on deposits and lower auto loan balances and margins. Non-interest expense was down about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our National Digital Bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.77% up 72 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.64%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 37 basis points, while the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 26 basis points, both of these linked quarter increases were better than typical seasonal expectations. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 2%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Both ending deposits and average deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter, consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters as we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the third quarter declined 137 basis points from the second quarter to 0.25%. The second quarter charge-off rate was elevated by charge-offs we recognized when we moved the portfolio of commercial office loans to held for sale. We completed the sale of that portfolio in the third quarter. Slide 17 of the third quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.08%, up 135 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was essentially flat at 0.9%. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We posted another quarter of strong top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans. The pace of domestic card delinquency normalization slowed. We grew consumer and total deposits. And we added liquidity and capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Turning now to operating efficiency. The third quarter operating efficiency ratio was particularly strong. Operating efficiency ratio can vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by the timing of revenue and operating expense. We expect 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. At our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Amy, please start the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good evening, everyone. So Rich, you noted several times that delinquency normalization has slowed. It looked like September charge-off performance was better than we would have expected. But we are hearing from others that pressure is becoming broader, not just sub-prime, but it's also into prime. So can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing within your portfolio? What do you think about the pace of delinquency normalization? And do you have any line of sight when you think losses will inevitably peak? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Ryan. So let's just pull up on the metrics here. Our third quarter domestic card charge-off rate was essentially flat from the prior quarter, up 2 basis points to 4.40%. Our 30 plus delinquency rate increased 57 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.31%. Both our losses and our delinquencies are modestly above their pre-pandemic levels. Now let's talk about sort of what's happening at the margin here. The trend of normalization in our credit metrics appears to be slowing. In August and September, the month-to-month movement in our delinquencies was essentially in line with normal seasonality for the first time since normalization began. We've also seen some stabilization in new delinquency entries, relative to normal seasonal patterns. So we are hopeful these stabilization trends continue. Now charge-offs, of course, are a lagging metric, so they have some months of catching up still to do. In auto, we have seen stabilization even longer. Our losses are modestly above pre-pandemic levels, but moving in line with normal seasonality for the past few quarters. So back to our card business for a moment. There's another stabilization trend that we see as well, which is our recovery rate. Our recovery rate had been falling for several years because of the low level of charge-offs through the pandemic. So we've had less inventory, if you will, to recover on. And this was a larger effect for Capital One than for most of our competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime and not all at once, like in a debt sale. We've now seen the recovery rates stabilize, although, it remains at unusually low levels. Now recoveries, of course, don't impact our delinquencies, but they are a pretty significant factor when -- in our charge-offs and particularly when comparing our charge-offs to pre-pandemic benchmarks. Now another Capital One's specific point here. There's another factor sort of driving stabilization, but this is -- has been going on for a long time and that's the stability of credit performance in our recent origination vintages. So looking ahead, the economy is, as always a source of uncertainty. In our outlook, we still expect the unemployment rate to worsen over the coming year. And as always, we remain very focused on resilience in our underwriting and making sure that we build resilience, a lot of resilience into all of our choices.\nRyan Nash: Maybe, Rich, as my follow-up question, so Andrew, you had highlighted that the domestic card allowance was relatively stable. And I think you gave three different factors. Maybe can you just remind us again what is included from a macro perspective in terms of unemployment? And if I take what Rich said regarding delinquency slowing and obviously, charge-offs are catch up a little bit. Do you think we're at the point where the replacement and the allowance is going to be less of a tailwind -- of a headwind going forward. And we can now finally have allowance more closely following -- the allowance build more closely following the loan growth? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Sure, Ryan. So to your economic assumption point, I'll focus on unemployment rate, although recall that a whole lot more is considered a whole bunch more variables, but we are now assuming the unemployment rate moves into the mid-4s by the middle of '24 and basically hold there for a period of time. But it's not just the absolute level of unemployment, as we've talked about before, it's also the change that influences underlying credit performance. How that then plays through the allowance, though, like a number of factors are going into the allowance calculation. As Rich said, the projected loss rates are going to be by far the biggest driver. And as we've talked about many times, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of credit performance, particularly over the next couple of quarters. And I won't go through the reasonable and supportable and reversion process elements that we've discussed previously, but I will say beyond the credit forecast, it is worth noting that the allowance framework considers a range of outcomes and uncertainties, which are generally wider in periods of either worsening or improving transitions. So at the core of your question, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters may be lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release. We could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined, at least in the near term as we incorporate the related uncertainty into the allowance. And so we'll go through our process as we do every year to take all of those factors into account and roll forward the allowance each quarter.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I was curious in terms of the health of the consumer, I was curious if you're seeing trends at all diverge between higher FICO and lower FICO scores, whether it's on credit performance or spending as we go through the recovery?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Mihir. Thank you for your question. So let's talk about credit performance. When credit first started to normalize, we called out that this trend was more pronounced at the low end of the market, whether defined by income or credit score. And strikingly, those were the segments that had improved the most early in the pandemic. So this was not surprising to us. Later, we observed that normalization was becoming more broad-based. And in fact, for many quarters now -- for several quarters now, every segment was basically normalizing at about the same rate. In other words, if you look at for any segment where its credit metrics were relative to like its delinquencies, for example, relative to pre-pandemic every segment was kind of on top of each other, everything had caught up. Now we are seeing stabilization come more quickly at the lower end of the market. In fact, over the last few months, our delinquencies in these segments have essentially stabilized on a seasonally adjusted basis. And our upmarket segments are sort of just a little bit behind that. So now, I don't think this is necessarily a description of the marketplace per se. This is what we see at Capital One. Our performance has been assisted by some of the underwriting changes that we made over the past couple of years, especially in response to credit to what we anticipated would be the impact of credit scores inflating FinTech's flooding the market. So as we've been talking about really for a couple of years now, we -- in our originations and overall in our credit policy, we were trimming around the edges for things that we saw or risks that we anticipated, and this has contributed, I think, to strength and stability and performance that's now contributing to what we see here. In terms of spend, the spend is basically -- pretty -- when we look at spend per customer, this has really moderated after the surge of spending coming out of the pandemic. So year-over-year, I'm [indiscernible] an overall Capital One point. Year-over-year spend growth per customer has been roughly flat for several months. So the growth in spend that you're seeing in our metrics is really being driven by new account origination. Now with respect to the various segments, the spend on the -- at the lower end of the marketplace is certainly probably the most moderated, although, we -- it moderated first, we've seen spend growth across our segments. Sort of fairly moderated, but I'd say the biggest effect on the moderating side has been in the lower end of the market.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s quite helpful. And then maybe just turning to NIM very quickly. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on NIM in the near term, particularly on the deposit competition side. Any thoughts on where deposit betas go? What are you seeing from a competitive standpoint? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Yeah. With respect to beta, as we've discussed in previous calls, there's really a couple of key factors that are impacting betas. The first is product mix. Sort of the rotation of customers across products. And then, the second is competitive pricing. And within that, I would include the notion of just deposit pricing lags that we've talked about. And so for us, the quarter-over-quarter beta with that lag effect was something like 160%. Our cumulative beta now stands at $57 million. And so that getting factored into NIM as we look ahead on that dimension, particularly assuming if rates do stay higher for longer, I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be some upward pressure on beta at least in the near term, driven by those factors that I described, the pricing and product mix piece. So beyond that then, in the NIM, we have seen spreads widen a bit here and wholesale funding costs are up a bit. And I think Rich talked about suppression in card, but depending on the path of credit, there's the potential at least for increased revenue suppression. So I would lump all of those three things together as potential headwinds. But from a tailwind perspective, we can continue to see growth in card and particularly revolving card balances as a percent of the balance sheet like you saw this quarter. And then the other thing that I would note, even though cash balances remain elevated relative to historical standards, I think we will see it settle out at a level that's higher than pre-pandemic, but ultimately lower than where we are today as you look ahead over multiple quarters. So those are really the primary factors that I would say are at play with respect to NIM.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Your line is open.\nArren Cyganovich: Yeah. Just touching on the last discussion on net interest margin. The card loan yields expanded, I think, 89 basis points and that was quite a bit higher than the base rate expansion for the quarter. You mentioned higher revolve rates, is that part of what you're seeing there? And how do the revolve rates compare today versus maybe where they were pre-pandemic?\nAndrew Young: Yeah. So part of it, Arren, is just said, if you're looking at yield as opposed to margin is you get a tailwind just from the Fed rate changes, but the other primary and larger factor than the Fed changes is, I would say, largely seasonality which does -- we typically see revolve rates in the third quarter just naturally be higher than they are throughout the year. And we also tend to see a bit more on the late fee piece there. So there is a seasonality dimension in terms of where we are with revolve rates going forward, I'll let Rich talk a little bit about the trends that we're seeing in the portfolio.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, Arren. So overall, in our Domestic Card business, revolve rates are basically where they were. So for example, third quarter 2023 revolve rates right on top of third quarter 2019, but it's very sort of very different within segments. The place that the revolver rate is quite a bit higher is in our partnerships business because we have the Walmart portfolio. We didn't have before the pandemic pretty much everywhere else across our branded book revolve rates are a little bit generally speaking a little bit to quite a bit lower than they were before. But the net impression I would leave with you, so our branded book overall is somewhat lower and the partnerships have offset that.\nArren Cyganovich: Got it. And then on the marketing, it looks like it was down just slightly year-over-year, still almost double where it was from a pre-pandemic perspective. Have you essentially hit kind of an -- almost a peak here in terms of marketing dollars and how do you think the expenses will go from there with respect to that?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Well, Arren, the -- on marketing, so just pulling up total company marketing was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and flat year-over-year. let's just pull up and talk about the big drivers of our marketing. First, we continue to really like the opportunities we're seeing in the market. Including additional -- the opportunities that we get in expanding channels and growing the number of card products we have, the benefit from our technology transformation that sort of is everywhere in what we do as we leverage more data. We're able to take advantage of powerful machine learning models, create customized better experiences for consumers. So that continues to have a lot of traction, and we are leaning into that. We also -- a very important part of our marketing spend and a thing we're really leaning into is our focus on heavy spenders. So when we think about our quest for heavy spenders, it really goes back to 2010 when we launched our Venture card, and that was the beginning of a strategic push that we have continued and accelerated ever since. And that involved more than just putting an attractive product out there. Heavy spenders, of course, to win with heavy spenders, we need great servicing, jaw-dropping customer experiences, of course, great value propositions. And this takes a significant investment in upfront promotions and in marketing and in brand building. And this is all about my observation, all the years of doing this business and watching players who succeed here and those who get less traction is very much about a sustained investment and the -- ultimately, the brand that one builds. So we're continuing to invest in -- also in building the properties and experiences to drive heavy spender growth at the top of the market. So these investments include our travel portal. Access to exclusive properties and experiences, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. And our sustained investment at the top of the market has helped drive momentum in -- overall in our spender business, but we've grown even faster with the heaviest of spenders and we very much like this business. In addition to the obvious spend growth we're enjoying, it generates strong revenues, has very low losses, low attrition and lifts the entire brand of the company. The final factor driving our marketing levels is our investment in continuing to build our National Bank. And of course, as we have a smaller branch footprint, our growth is powered by modern technology compelling digital experience, a cafe presence in heavily traveled locations across the nation and, of course, a sustained investment in marketing. So these are the really compelling opportunities that are driving our marketing levels and we continue to see great traction pretty much across the boards, and we continue to lean into these opportunities and it's an important part of the creation of long-term value for our shareholders.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRichard Shane: Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. I'd just like to talk a little bit about the depository franchise. Obviously, there's been very strong growth this year in the consumer banking franchise, particularly on the deposit side. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape -- you started, Rich, you talked a little bit about the network, the cafes, the less concentrated branch approach. But can you describe what you're seeing sort of broadly in the market where you think you're gaining share?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, one of the -- thank you, Rick. One of the core strategic approaches of Capital One, it really defines the founding idea of the company and pretty much all the choices we've made sense is to look at the marketplace and the Tsunami forces that are driving such change in the marketplace and really try to discern with all the noise in these marketplaces. Where is it that -- where is winning going to be? What's the future of these things? And almost always, it's a question of how technology is driving change. And so in retail banking, we, of course, entered banking way back in the mid-OOs (ph) driven most importantly by a desire to transform the balance sheet of our company to get away from capital market reliance and get not just a deposit driven balance sheet, but an insured deposit-driven balance sheet, hence, the quest for a consumer deposit franchise. Now along the way, as a very important part of our strategy as well. We look forward to trying to get at the forefront of where the world was going to go over time with respect to retail banking. From a heavy reliance on branches and by the way, I want to say at the outset, I think branches will be an important thing in the -- in banking for as far out as we can see. But you just can't help but see the evolution from the branch on the corner to the branch in your hand and really over time -- sorry, to the bank in your hand, to over time, the bank in your life that's very digitally interactive and both reactively and proactively being there where a consumer needs it on a real-time customized basis. So that's where we have -- that's the vision that we've been working backwards from. So in that journey, the first step, of course, was building a national savings business that was absolutely central to our balance sheet strategy for the company. But beyond that, we have worked very much to build a not just a national savings business, but a national full service bank. And to do that, it's not just a matter of sort of offering checking accounts, but I think Capital One was in a unique position, having retail banks in -- branches in about 20% of the nation and have a lot of experience with retail banking. Our view was if we're going to win in National Banking, we actually have to digitize the entire customer experience and just about everything that you can get in a branch to be able to -- for customers to get that on a digital basis. So what we've done over the years is build a full service digital, national bank. And we -- then as we have built this, we have then leveraged the big customer base we have, the national brand that we have and really added to our marketing and everywhere in our strategy, the build-out of this national bank, and we're getting a lot of traction, nice growth and a lot of traction on the brand side as consumers realize that Capital One, even though the branches across the nation really is a full service National Bank. So that's been our strategy for years. We continue to -- it's an important thing that we lean into from a marketing point of view. But basically, our quest is to build -- continue to build a national bank without getting there by virtue of just lots and lots of acquisitions of branch-based banks. Thanks.\nRichard Shane: Thank you, Rich.\nA \u2013 Jeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDonald Fandetti: Yes. Rich, I was wondering, given your good trends in auto delinquency, are you sort of inclined to be leaning a little harder into auto lending or do you need to see something before making that decision?\nRichard Fairbank: Don, thank you for your question. It's funny. We have zig (ph) while others is zag for so long -- as long as I can remember in the auto business. And our strategy isn't just as zig, while other is zag, it's always to look at this marketplace and really objectively see where the opportunities are. This is a more volatile business in terms of our growth strategies, then the credit card business is because of the role that a dealer plays in the business in a sense, holding auctions at the dealership such that -- we -- our growth strategies are particularly sensitive to the credit and underwriting choices that our competitors make because it's sort of amplified in this auction-based environment with dealers really quite a contrast from the credit card business -- to the credit card business where certainly the competitive choices matter. But it's really still a one-on-one business with our customers and prospective customers. That's why you see so much more stability in sort of the marketing and the marketing sort of and the and leaning into the growth that you see on the card side. So as when you think about the last few years. So we've certainly had in the last five or six years, tremendous growth and traction in the auto business. And we -- our strategy was so powered by our technology that we've invested in the business, the data, the underwriting capabilities and the very deep relationships that we've been building with dealers. Over the last couple of years, we were concerned at what was happening with margins as they were pressured by interest rate increases in 2022 and early 2023, some competitors were slow to adjust their pricing. Now more recently, industry lending margins have largely normalized as interest rates have stabilized and many players, including late movers have continued to increase pricing. The other thing, of course, was watching very closely the credit side of the business. And we -- just as we did in the card business, probably actually more proactively and more significantly in auto, we trimmed back around the edges in anticipation of certain worsening and with concerns about score drift in, with respect to the data [indiscernible] from consumers. So that has -- and you've seen the data that where Capital One has pulled back quite a bit. Our outstandings have been shrinking a little bit. You also have seen the striking credit performance we've had and the stability now that is at least two quarters long in terms of what we\u2019re seeing on various credit metrics. So seeing the good metrics and seeing the marketplace, we\u2019re certainly on the lookout for opportunities, but I\u2019m not here to predict an acceleration, but we certainly do like the performance of both our front book and our back book at this point.\nDonald Fandetti: Thanks.\nA \u2013 Jeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. First question just on the adjusted operating efficiency rate. You've seen some nice improvements over the last two quarters. And I know, Rich, you talked about sort of the year outlook. I'm just wondering, if we could see this type of level or trends sustain itself into next year?\nRichard Fairbank: Sanjay, we're not going to be giving out guidance on -- at this point on where operating efficiency goes. We certainly are pleased with the progress that we've made over time in operating efficiency ratio even as we've continued to really invest in the business and we're starting to see -- we have these two competing things going on inside Capital One, both a real investment in technology and also at the same time, generating a bunch of benefits and efficiencies from that technology. So the net result of these two things has been -- we've been able to really make tremendous strides forward in technology and also get some efficiencies along the way. I wouldn't put too much reliance on any one quarter, you know these numbers kind of bounce around. But certainly, you probably noticed that in our guidance, we had guidance of flat to modestly down with respect to our efficiency ratio for full year 2023, and we took the flat part out, and we're now just at modestly down. So we continue to believe, over the long term that our technology transformation offers a lot of promise for operating efficiencies and delivering operating efficiency is an important part of, I think, the value creation equation for investors. I do want to say, though, at the same time, we continue to really see great opportunities in the business. We continue to still invest in technology to capitalize on even greater opportunities over time. And that's the story of our operating efficiency ratio.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Perfect. Then I have a follow-up question just on the leaning into growth in card. Where exactly is that happening? I mean, obviously, you talked about adjusting the risk parameters, and that's obviously flowing through in the credit numbers improving. Is it more on the transactor side that you're leading into growth or is it balanced across all segments? I'm just curious sort of the implications on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Thank you. So we are finding traction across the spectrum really. So -- and we're leaning in across the spectrum. One thing I do want to say about growth, the outstandings growth if we really think about just the strength of loan growth -- for a while, the striking loan growth for Capital One and the industry was -- we all said, well, this is just reversing the pullbacks from the pandemic. But I think for us and for a lot of players in the industry, these loan numbers have blown past prior levels. And let's just reflect a little bit on what has sustained this. My view is, well, there's the Capital One effect. We continue to have significant new account growth, and that obviously powers a lot of overtime loan growth. Payment rates are coming down. Interestingly, they have come down quite a bit. But as a general statement, they're not down to where they were before. Part of that mix effect at Capital One because we've had a lot of traction on the spending side. But even within segments, if I were to generalize, payment rates, the payment rates are still higher than they were pre-pandemic. So again, inside that, there's partly a Capital One effect, but I think also sort of a strength of the consumer effect. However, the payment rates have come down and that somewhat and that has powered growth. And I think likely no one's going to be able to prove this, but I think there are inflation effects underneath the surface. When things cost more as long as consumer incomes stay up to where inflation is, you generally have some natural, I think, inflation effects that drive some of this growth as well. So we see a lot of strength there. And some of those are Capital One specific comments, I\u2019m making and several of those are really kind of industry points.\nA \u2013 Jeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Good afternoon. On the -- back to the -- your commentary around the slowing pace of the increase in delinquencies that you're seeing in card and some of the stabilization that you're citing. I know you indicated that charge-offs should of course, lag that. Can you give us maybe some way to think about how long that lag could be? Is it a two to three quarter type of window that we're looking for losses to follow through on that front? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Well, I don't want to make a precise prediction on that. I want to first of all, pull up and say, when we -- the thing that we tell everybody to look at is, what we say is, what we look at is delinquencies because that is the first indicator, that's why we have been talking not just quarterly but really even looking at the last couple of months and seeing the sort of more stabilization on the credit card side, which is very encouraging. Delinquency basically customers go delinquent and ultimately charge off six months later. And so there is -- but sometimes they go faster, sometimes they go slower. And of course, lots of times they make their payments. But we're talking about these things being measured in over a couple of quarters. The relationship between the delinquencies and the charge-offs .\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Yes. I hate to re-ask this question, but I think a lot of investors want to make a fine point on this in the fourth quarter. Going back to Ryan and John's question about net charge-offs I think that perhaps what's holding back credit-sensitive financials is obviously the prospect of recession -- but Rich, everything that you've said has seen positive pace of delinquency rate normalization slowing, stability of credit performance in recent vintages. As we think about what happened in September in terms of the card charge-off rate and look at the quarterly charge-off rate in third quarter and second quarter. Is it fair to draw the conclusion that as we look forward to the fourth quarter net charge-off rate that given the stability of all the leading indicators that the charge-off rate will be mostly driven by seasonality rather than normalization, if normalization has stabilized for now?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. So Erika, thanks for your question. Let me say a few things. So let's -- first of all, one of the things that makes this already challenging business for everyone studying it, including those of us who live it every day, is the seasonality -- in the volatility, which a big element of that is seasonality. So let's just let's -- talk just a little bit about seasonality. Card and auto delinquencies tend to improve each year around the tax refund season and then they worsen gradually over the rest of the year. The second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for card delinquencies and Q4 is the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies. So they tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. And now in the third quarter, so our domestic card delinquencies increased. So it's kind of interesting that we're talking about sort of a leveling -- a stabilizing kind of direction when we're actually looking at delinquencies for the quarter that went up 57 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. And that's versus a typical seasonal expectation of kind of -- sort of somewhere in the neighborhood of like 37 basis points. But -- so you can even see for the quarter that most of the increase that we observed was seasonal. But then that's where we've said. If you zoom in the month -- the months of August and September, the month-over-month movement is getting really close to just the normal seasonal trend. And so this is one of the early indications that the trend of normalization we've been seeing may be stabilizing. Now one thing I want to say, obviously, you hear bullish man in my commentary, I'm not here to just wave my arms and declare a turn. We have a couple of months of very encouraging data. We'd love to see more data where we have seen a couple of quarters where we've seen a longer stretch of data is in the -- more on the lower end of the card business, interestingly, as I talked about, and in the auto business. So that's where things have really kind of appear to have stabilized. Our upmarket card business is getting there a little bit not quite as -- not quite there yet. So I start by saying, we'd love to see a little more data to be fully confident of what we're seeing. The second thing, I want to say with -- then now to your question about charge-offs, first of all, what we see, especially in the months of August and September, you're not going to see that show up with stabilized charge-offs as soon as the fourth quarter because it really is a couple of quarters that -- to the earlier question that was asked, it's really a couple of quarters before the charge-offs performed sort of in line with the delinquencies. So we're not going to make predictions here, and I don't -- I just I always -- we're always very kind of try to be as clear as we can on what we see. We happen to see some pretty positive things here, but they can also be ahead fake and a head fake and not be as good as they appear.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. When you think about capital ratios and Basel end game and the need to build capital specifically for unused lines, how do you think about mitigating if at all, mitigating your unused lines and given your capital target of about 11% today, maybe you could just talk to us about the factor of Basel unused lines and the effect going over on your capital levels and the ROTCE target? And then I just have a follow-up, if you don't mind. Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Yeah, I'm going to come back, Dominick, because the last half of your question. I wasn't sure I followed it. But in terms of unused lines, one of our long-standing strategies has been to start people with smaller lines and allow them to grow. And so, I would say, I wouldn't expect a meaningful shift in that strategy solely in the service of risk-weighted assets. So overall, though, as you look at the risk weightings that have come out in the end game proposal. For us, in aggregate, recall, we're not in mortgage or trading. So looking at the net of retail and commercial, inclusive of the gold plating, those are largely fighting to a draw in terms of overall risk-weighting impact, specifically on the asset side. Like everyone else, of course, we're going to have an impact from the operational risk RWA. But I didn't quite follow the second half of your question around ROTCEs. Could you just repeat that for me?\nDominick Gabriele: Sure. Sorry about that. I was just curious, if you basically had to hold more capital because it's my understanding that you would have to hold additional capital against unused lines versus just drawn lines now. And so I was just curious, if your capital ratio would have to rise and -- and if that would affect the long-term return on like return on in any way?\nAndrew Young: Got it. Yeah, sorry, I didn't quite follow the second half of it. That was what I was trying to explain in my answer is, the net of all of that ultimately ends up being a wash, the part where we will be holding more capital on the denominator side, strictly for the risk-weighting assets again, I should highlight that it's in a comment period, a lot of industry focus on it and well, particularly as it relates to the opt risk calculation, there could be material impacts on the final outcome relative to what's proposed. But taking what is currently proposed, the asset side specifically outside of the operational risk ends up being roughly a draw for us, and it's really just the operational risk that's going to require us to hold more capital.\nJeff Norris: Dominick, you have a follow-up? Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Norris: You there Bill.\nBill Carcache: Can you hear me?\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah.\nBill Carcache: Okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah. So I wanted to ask about the leaf fee proposal. The consensus view is that we'll get it very soon. It will be immediately litigated. Can you give us your view on the likely path that you would anticipate and possibly speak to any potential costs that might be associated with it?\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thank you, Bill. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. And while the CFPB's proposal has not yet been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon, probably before the end of the year. Now once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of this rule. And this litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of 2024 and maybe longer. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. These choices include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect many will come after the rule change takes effect.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: One moment please. Our final question is a follow-up from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey. Sorry about that. I think I got cut off. Can you hear me okay?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes, we can Dominick.\nDominick Gabriele: All right. Sorry about that, guys. I was actually just curious on the quarter-over-quarter increase in domestic card yield. I know that there's sometimes some seasonality in the third quarter, and we've also had a lot of rate hikes in previous years around the third quarter. I was wondering if you could just walk us through some of the dynamics in the quarter-over-quarter increase in domestic card? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Young: Yeah, Dominick. I can't remember who asked it earlier, but just reiterating some of those points, I think you largely answered your own question, which is there is seasonality that in part is -- or is a function of the revolve rates driven by some of the dynamics, Rich talked about over the course of the year, we did see the Fed move. And then we also saw a bit of late fees, which I would lump into the seasonality dimension. And then finally, we had one more day in the third quarter, so day count in an absolute sense, not necessarily relative to peers, which I think was the nature of the question earlier, but at least in an absolute sense. Those are the big drivers of what drove the quarter-over-quarter yield.\nJeff Norris: Well, thanks, everybody for joining us on the conference call this evening, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Investor Relations team will be here later this evening to answer any questions that you may have. Have a great evening, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. The domestic card business posted another strong quarter of year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 6% from the third quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $19 billion or about 16% year-over-year and third quarter revenue was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 31 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 18.24%. The decline was driven by two factors: First, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin; and second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in revolve rate. On a linked quarter basis, the revenue margin increased seasonally by 48 basis points. Domestic Card credit results continue to normalize from the historically strong results we saw during the pandemic, consistent with our expectations. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 220 basis points year-over-year to 4.4%. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 4.31%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was essentially flat and the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 57 basis points. Both the monthly delinquency rate and the monthly charge-off rate are now modestly above 2019 levels. Our delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing. Non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of '22 -- of 2022. Total company marketing expense of $972 million for the quarter was also relatively flat year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, marketing increased 10%. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation and our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. As a result, we are leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We expect fourth quarter marketing will be seasonally higher. Slide 12 shows third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the third quarter, auto originations declined 10% year-over-year, driven by the decline in auto originations, consumer banking ending loans decreased about $4.4 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another strong quarter in year-over-year retail deposit growth. Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $34 billion or 13% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 7% year-over-year driven by the higher rate paid on deposits and lower auto loan balances and margins. Non-interest expense was down about 6% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our National Digital Bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.77% up 72 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.64%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was up 37 basis points, while the 30 plus delinquency rate was up 26 basis points, both of these linked quarter increases were better than typical seasonal expectations. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were essentially flat. Average loans were down about 2%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit. Both ending deposits and average deposits were down about 2% from the linked quarter, consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters as we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6%. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate for the third quarter declined 137 basis points from the second quarter to 0.25%. The second quarter charge-off rate was elevated by charge-offs we recognized when we moved the portfolio of commercial office loans to held for sale. We completed the sale of that portfolio in the third quarter. Slide 17 of the third quarter 2023 results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of our total loans. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.08%, up 135 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate was essentially flat at 0.9%. In closing, we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. We posted another quarter of strong top line growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans. The pace of domestic card delinquency normalization slowed. We grew consumer and total deposits. And we added liquidity and capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Turning now to operating efficiency. The third quarter operating efficiency ratio was particularly strong. Operating efficiency ratio can vary from quarter-to-quarter, driven by the timing of revenue and operating expense. We expect 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. At our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. We remain well positioned to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Thanks, Ryan. So let's just pull up on the metrics here. Our third quarter domestic card charge-off rate was essentially flat from the prior quarter, up 2 basis points to 4.40%. Our 30 plus delinquency rate increased 57 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.31%. Both our losses and our delinquencies are modestly above their pre-pandemic levels. Now let's talk about sort of what's happening at the margin here. The trend of normalization in our credit metrics appears to be slowing. In August and September, the month-to-month movement in our delinquencies was essentially in line with normal seasonality for the first time since normalization began. We've also seen some stabilization in new delinquency entries, relative to normal seasonal patterns. So we are hopeful these stabilization trends continue. Now charge-offs, of course, are a lagging metric, so they have some months of catching up still to do. In auto, we have seen stabilization even longer. Our losses are modestly above pre-pandemic levels, but moving in line with normal seasonality for the past few quarters. So back to our card business for a moment. There's another stabilization trend that we see as well, which is our recovery rate. Our recovery rate had been falling for several years because of the low level of charge-offs through the pandemic. So we've had less inventory, if you will, to recover on. And this was a larger effect for Capital One than for most of our competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average. And because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they come in overtime and not all at once, like in a debt sale. We've now seen the recovery rates stabilize, although, it remains at unusually low levels. Now recoveries, of course, don't impact our delinquencies, but they are a pretty significant factor when -- in our charge-offs and particularly when comparing our charge-offs to pre-pandemic benchmarks. Now another Capital One's specific point here. There's another factor sort of driving stabilization, but this is -- has been going on for a long time and that's the stability of credit performance in our recent origination vintages. So looking ahead, the economy is, as always a source of uncertainty. In our outlook, we still expect the unemployment rate to worsen over the coming year. And as always, we remain very focused on resilience in our underwriting and making sure that we build resilience, a lot of resilience into all of our choices. Yes, Mihir. Thank you for your question. So let's talk about credit performance. When credit first started to normalize, we called out that this trend was more pronounced at the low end of the market, whether defined by income or credit score. And strikingly, those were the segments that had improved the most early in the pandemic. So this was not surprising to us. Later, we observed that normalization was becoming more broad-based. And in fact, for many quarters now -- for several quarters now, every segment was basically normalizing at about the same rate. In other words, if you look at for any segment where its credit metrics were relative to like its delinquencies, for example, relative to pre-pandemic every segment was kind of on top of each other, everything had caught up. Now we are seeing stabilization come more quickly at the lower end of the market. In fact, over the last few months, our delinquencies in these segments have essentially stabilized on a seasonally adjusted basis. And our upmarket segments are sort of just a little bit behind that. So now, I don't think this is necessarily a description of the marketplace per se. This is what we see at Capital One. Our performance has been assisted by some of the underwriting changes that we made over the past couple of years, especially in response to credit to what we anticipated would be the impact of credit scores inflating FinTech's flooding the market. So as we've been talking about really for a couple of years now, we -- in our originations and overall in our credit policy, we were trimming around the edges for things that we saw or risks that we anticipated, and this has contributed, I think, to strength and stability and performance that's now contributing to what we see here. In terms of spend, the spend is basically -- pretty -- when we look at spend per customer, this has really moderated after the surge of spending coming out of the pandemic. So year-over-year, I'm [indiscernible] an overall Capital One point. Year-over-year spend growth per customer has been roughly flat for several months. So the growth in spend that you're seeing in our metrics is really being driven by new account origination. Now with respect to the various segments, the spend on the -- at the lower end of the marketplace is certainly probably the most moderated, although, we -- it moderated first, we've seen spend growth across our segments. Sort of fairly moderated, but I'd say the biggest effect on the moderating side has been in the lower end of the market. Yes, Arren. So overall, in our Domestic Card business, revolve rates are basically where they were. So for example, third quarter 2023 revolve rates right on top of third quarter 2019, but it's very sort of very different within segments. The place that the revolver rate is quite a bit higher is in our partnerships business because we have the Walmart portfolio. We didn't have before the pandemic pretty much everywhere else across our branded book revolve rates are a little bit generally speaking a little bit to quite a bit lower than they were before. But the net impression I would leave with you, so our branded book overall is somewhat lower and the partnerships have offset that. Okay. Well, Arren, the -- on marketing, so just pulling up total company marketing was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and flat year-over-year. let's just pull up and talk about the big drivers of our marketing. First, we continue to really like the opportunities we're seeing in the market. Including additional -- the opportunities that we get in expanding channels and growing the number of card products we have, the benefit from our technology transformation that sort of is everywhere in what we do as we leverage more data. We're able to take advantage of powerful machine learning models, create customized better experiences for consumers. So that continues to have a lot of traction, and we are leaning into that. We also -- a very important part of our marketing spend and a thing we're really leaning into is our focus on heavy spenders. So when we think about our quest for heavy spenders, it really goes back to 2010 when we launched our Venture card, and that was the beginning of a strategic push that we have continued and accelerated ever since. And that involved more than just putting an attractive product out there. Heavy spenders, of course, to win with heavy spenders, we need great servicing, jaw-dropping customer experiences, of course, great value propositions. And this takes a significant investment in upfront promotions and in marketing and in brand building. And this is all about my observation, all the years of doing this business and watching players who succeed here and those who get less traction is very much about a sustained investment and the -- ultimately, the brand that one builds. So we're continuing to invest in -- also in building the properties and experiences to drive heavy spender growth at the top of the market. So these investments include our travel portal. Access to exclusive properties and experiences, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. And our sustained investment at the top of the market has helped drive momentum in -- overall in our spender business, but we've grown even faster with the heaviest of spenders and we very much like this business. In addition to the obvious spend growth we're enjoying, it generates strong revenues, has very low losses, low attrition and lifts the entire brand of the company. The final factor driving our marketing levels is our investment in continuing to build our National Bank. And of course, as we have a smaller branch footprint, our growth is powered by modern technology compelling digital experience, a cafe presence in heavily traveled locations across the nation and, of course, a sustained investment in marketing. So these are the really compelling opportunities that are driving our marketing levels and we continue to see great traction pretty much across the boards, and we continue to lean into these opportunities and it's an important part of the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. Well, one of the -- thank you, Rick. One of the core strategic approaches of Capital One, it really defines the founding idea of the company and pretty much all the choices we've made sense is to look at the marketplace and the Tsunami forces that are driving such change in the marketplace and really try to discern with all the noise in these marketplaces. Where is it that -- where is winning going to be? What's the future of these things? And almost always, it's a question of how technology is driving change. And so in retail banking, we, of course, entered banking way back in the mid-OOs (ph) driven most importantly by a desire to transform the balance sheet of our company to get away from capital market reliance and get not just a deposit driven balance sheet, but an insured deposit-driven balance sheet, hence, the quest for a consumer deposit franchise. Now along the way, as a very important part of our strategy as well. We look forward to trying to get at the forefront of where the world was going to go over time with respect to retail banking. From a heavy reliance on branches and by the way, I want to say at the outset, I think branches will be an important thing in the -- in banking for as far out as we can see. But you just can't help but see the evolution from the branch on the corner to the branch in your hand and really over time -- sorry, to the bank in your hand, to over time, the bank in your life that's very digitally interactive and both reactively and proactively being there where a consumer needs it on a real-time customized basis. So that's where we have -- that's the vision that we've been working backwards from. So in that journey, the first step, of course, was building a national savings business that was absolutely central to our balance sheet strategy for the company. But beyond that, we have worked very much to build a not just a national savings business, but a national full service bank. And to do that, it's not just a matter of sort of offering checking accounts, but I think Capital One was in a unique position, having retail banks in -- branches in about 20% of the nation and have a lot of experience with retail banking. Our view was if we're going to win in National Banking, we actually have to digitize the entire customer experience and just about everything that you can get in a branch to be able to -- for customers to get that on a digital basis. So what we've done over the years is build a full service digital, national bank. And we -- then as we have built this, we have then leveraged the big customer base we have, the national brand that we have and really added to our marketing and everywhere in our strategy, the build-out of this national bank, and we're getting a lot of traction, nice growth and a lot of traction on the brand side as consumers realize that Capital One, even though the branches across the nation really is a full service National Bank. So that's been our strategy for years. We continue to -- it's an important thing that we lean into from a marketing point of view. But basically, our quest is to build -- continue to build a national bank without getting there by virtue of just lots and lots of acquisitions of branch-based banks. Thanks. Don, thank you for your question. It's funny. We have zig (ph) while others is zag for so long -- as long as I can remember in the auto business. And our strategy isn't just as zig, while other is zag, it's always to look at this marketplace and really objectively see where the opportunities are. This is a more volatile business in terms of our growth strategies, then the credit card business is because of the role that a dealer plays in the business in a sense, holding auctions at the dealership such that -- we -- our growth strategies are particularly sensitive to the credit and underwriting choices that our competitors make because it's sort of amplified in this auction-based environment with dealers really quite a contrast from the credit card business -- to the credit card business where certainly the competitive choices matter. But it's really still a one-on-one business with our customers and prospective customers. That's why you see so much more stability in sort of the marketing and the marketing sort of and the and leaning into the growth that you see on the card side. So as when you think about the last few years. So we've certainly had in the last five or six years, tremendous growth and traction in the auto business. And we -- our strategy was so powered by our technology that we've invested in the business, the data, the underwriting capabilities and the very deep relationships that we've been building with dealers. Over the last couple of years, we were concerned at what was happening with margins as they were pressured by interest rate increases in 2022 and early 2023, some competitors were slow to adjust their pricing. Now more recently, industry lending margins have largely normalized as interest rates have stabilized and many players, including late movers have continued to increase pricing. The other thing, of course, was watching very closely the credit side of the business. And we -- just as we did in the card business, probably actually more proactively and more significantly in auto, we trimmed back around the edges in anticipation of certain worsening and with concerns about score drift in, with respect to the data [indiscernible] from consumers. So that has -- and you've seen the data that where Capital One has pulled back quite a bit. Our outstandings have been shrinking a little bit. You also have seen the striking credit performance we've had and the stability now that is at least two quarters long in terms of what we're seeing on various credit metrics. So seeing the good metrics and seeing the marketplace, we're certainly on the lookout for opportunities, but I'm not here to predict an acceleration, but we certainly do like the performance of both our front book and our back book at this point. Sanjay, we're not going to be giving out guidance on -- at this point on where operating efficiency goes. We certainly are pleased with the progress that we've made over time in operating efficiency ratio even as we've continued to really invest in the business and we're starting to see -- we have these two competing things going on inside Capital One, both a real investment in technology and also at the same time, generating a bunch of benefits and efficiencies from that technology. So the net result of these two things has been -- we've been able to really make tremendous strides forward in technology and also get some efficiencies along the way. I wouldn't put too much reliance on any one quarter, you know these numbers kind of bounce around. But certainly, you probably noticed that in our guidance, we had guidance of flat to modestly down with respect to our efficiency ratio for full year 2023, and we took the flat part out, and we're now just at modestly down. So we continue to believe, over the long term that our technology transformation offers a lot of promise for operating efficiencies and delivering operating efficiency is an important part of, I think, the value creation equation for investors. I do want to say, though, at the same time, we continue to really see great opportunities in the business. We continue to still invest in technology to capitalize on even greater opportunities over time. And that's the story of our operating efficiency ratio. Yeah. Thank you. So we are finding traction across the spectrum really. So -- and we're leaning in across the spectrum. One thing I do want to say about growth, the outstandings growth if we really think about just the strength of loan growth -- for a while, the striking loan growth for Capital One and the industry was -- we all said, well, this is just reversing the pullbacks from the pandemic. But I think for us and for a lot of players in the industry, these loan numbers have blown past prior levels. And let's just reflect a little bit on what has sustained this. My view is, well, there's the Capital One effect. We continue to have significant new account growth, and that obviously powers a lot of overtime loan growth. Payment rates are coming down. Interestingly, they have come down quite a bit. But as a general statement, they're not down to where they were before. Part of that mix effect at Capital One because we've had a lot of traction on the spending side. But even within segments, if I were to generalize, payment rates, the payment rates are still higher than they were pre-pandemic. So again, inside that, there's partly a Capital One effect, but I think also sort of a strength of the consumer effect. However, the payment rates have come down and that somewhat and that has powered growth. And I think likely no one's going to be able to prove this, but I think there are inflation effects underneath the surface. When things cost more as long as consumer incomes stay up to where inflation is, you generally have some natural, I think, inflation effects that drive some of this growth as well. So we see a lot of strength there. And some of those are Capital One specific comments, I'm making and several of those are really kind of industry points.\nA \u2013 Jeff Norris: Next question please. Well, I don't want to make a precise prediction on that. I want to first of all, pull up and say, when we -- the thing that we tell everybody to look at is, what we say is, what we look at is delinquencies because that is the first indicator, that's why we have been talking not just quarterly but really even looking at the last couple of months and seeing the sort of more stabilization on the credit card side, which is very encouraging. Delinquency basically customers go delinquent and ultimately charge off six months later. And so there is -- but sometimes they go faster, sometimes they go slower. And of course, lots of times they make their payments. But we're talking about these things being measured in over a couple of quarters. The relationship between the delinquencies and the charge-offs . Yeah. So Erika, thanks for your question. Let me say a few things. So let's -- first of all, one of the things that makes this already challenging business for everyone studying it, including those of us who live it every day, is the seasonality -- in the volatility, which a big element of that is seasonality. So let's just let's -- talk just a little bit about seasonality. Card and auto delinquencies tend to improve each year around the tax refund season and then they worsen gradually over the rest of the year. The second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for card delinquencies and Q4 is the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies. So they tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. And now in the third quarter, so our domestic card delinquencies increased. So it's kind of interesting that we're talking about sort of a leveling -- a stabilizing kind of direction when we're actually looking at delinquencies for the quarter that went up 57 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. And that's versus a typical seasonal expectation of kind of -- sort of somewhere in the neighborhood of like 37 basis points. But -- so you can even see for the quarter that most of the increase that we observed was seasonal. But then that's where we've said. If you zoom in the month -- the months of August and September, the month-over-month movement is getting really close to just the normal seasonal trend. And so this is one of the early indications that the trend of normalization we've been seeing may be stabilizing. Now one thing I want to say, obviously, you hear bullish man in my commentary, I'm not here to just wave my arms and declare a turn. We have a couple of months of very encouraging data. We'd love to see more data where we have seen a couple of quarters where we've seen a longer stretch of data is in the -- more on the lower end of the card business, interestingly, as I talked about, and in the auto business. So that's where things have really kind of appear to have stabilized. Our upmarket card business is getting there a little bit not quite as -- not quite there yet. So I start by saying, we'd love to see a little more data to be fully confident of what we're seeing. The second thing, I want to say with -- then now to your question about charge-offs, first of all, what we see, especially in the months of August and September, you're not going to see that show up with stabilized charge-offs as soon as the fourth quarter because it really is a couple of quarters that -- to the earlier question that was asked, it's really a couple of quarters before the charge-offs performed sort of in line with the delinquencies. So we're not going to make predictions here, and I don't -- I just I always -- we're always very kind of try to be as clear as we can on what we see. We happen to see some pretty positive things here, but they can also be ahead fake and a head fake and not be as good as they appear. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Bill. So the CFPB's late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately 75%. And while the CFPB's proposal has not yet been finalized, we expect the CFPB to publish a proposal soon, probably before the end of the year. Now once the CFPB publishes its final rule, we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of this rule. And this litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of 2024 and maybe longer. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our P&L in the near term. However, we have a set of mitigating actions that we're working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect. These choices include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect many will come after the rule change takes effect. Yes, we can Dominick."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion, or $4.45 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.5 billion were up 7% compared to the second quarter and 17% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our domestic card business. Period end deposits increased 1% in the quarter, while average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits ended the quarter at 80% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 4%, driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income. Non-interest expense increased 1% in the quarter, as higher marketing expense was partially offset by lower operating expense. Provision expense was $2.3 billion with $2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $322 million. Turning to Slide 4. I'll cover the allowance balance in greater detail. The $322 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $15 billion as of September 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.75%, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. Relative to last quarter's assumptions underlying the allowance, the baseline forecast in this quarter for most key economic variables improved. However, we continue to assume several key economic variables worsened from today's levels. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $349 million. The coverage ratio was largely flat at 7.79%. The predominant driver of the increased allowance was the growth in loans. The positive impact from the modestly improved economic outlook was largely offset by the impact of replacing the lost content of the third quarter of 2023 with a 12-month reasonable and supportable period that now includes the third quarter of 2024. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $136 million. The improved economic outlook and a decline in loan balances drove the release. And in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $97 million. The build reflected the impact of rising interest rates and other factors on certain commercial real estate and corporate borrowers, including our commercial office portfolio. On Slide 17 in the appendix, we have included additional details on the office portfolio. I'll also note that in the third quarter, we completed the sale of approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio that were previously marked as held for sale. The commercial -- the coverage ratio in the Commercial business increased by 12 basis points and now stands at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 155%, up from 150% last quarter and 139% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter were largely flat at $118 billion. Higher cash balances were offset by a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, up about $3 billion from the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 21 basis points higher than last quarter and 11 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by higher card yields, a continued mix shift towards card loans and one additional day in the quarter, partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13%, approximately 30 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases we completed in the quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure, Ryan. So to your economic assumption point, I'll focus on unemployment rate, although recall that a whole lot more is considered a whole bunch more variables, but we are now assuming the unemployment rate moves into the mid-4s by the middle of '24 and basically hold there for a period of time. But it's not just the absolute level of unemployment, as we've talked about before, it's also the change that influences underlying credit performance. How that then plays through the allowance, though, like a number of factors are going into the allowance calculation. As Rich said, the projected loss rates are going to be by far the biggest driver. And as we've talked about many times, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of credit performance, particularly over the next couple of quarters. And I won't go through the reasonable and supportable and reversion process elements that we've discussed previously, but I will say beyond the credit forecast, it is worth noting that the allowance framework considers a range of outcomes and uncertainties, which are generally wider in periods of either worsening or improving transitions. So at the core of your question, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters may be lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release. We could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined, at least in the near term as we incorporate the related uncertainty into the allowance. And so we'll go through our process as we do every year to take all of those factors into account and roll forward the allowance each quarter. Yeah. With respect to beta, as we've discussed in previous calls, there's really a couple of key factors that are impacting betas. The first is product mix. Sort of the rotation of customers across products. And then, the second is competitive pricing. And within that, I would include the notion of just deposit pricing lags that we've talked about. And so for us, the quarter-over-quarter beta with that lag effect was something like 160%. Our cumulative beta now stands at $57 million. And so that getting factored into NIM as we look ahead on that dimension, particularly assuming if rates do stay higher for longer, I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be some upward pressure on beta at least in the near term, driven by those factors that I described, the pricing and product mix piece. So beyond that then, in the NIM, we have seen spreads widen a bit here and wholesale funding costs are up a bit. And I think Rich talked about suppression in card, but depending on the path of credit, there's the potential at least for increased revenue suppression. So I would lump all of those three things together as potential headwinds. But from a tailwind perspective, we can continue to see growth in card and particularly revolving card balances as a percent of the balance sheet like you saw this quarter. And then the other thing that I would note, even though cash balances remain elevated relative to historical standards, I think we will see it settle out at a level that's higher than pre-pandemic, but ultimately lower than where we are today as you look ahead over multiple quarters. So those are really the primary factors that I would say are at play with respect to NIM. Yeah. So part of it, Arren, is just said, if you're looking at yield as opposed to margin is you get a tailwind just from the Fed rate changes, but the other primary and larger factor than the Fed changes is, I would say, largely seasonality which does -- we typically see revolve rates in the third quarter just naturally be higher than they are throughout the year. And we also tend to see a bit more on the late fee piece there. So there is a seasonality dimension in terms of where we are with revolve rates going forward, I'll let Rich talk a little bit about the trends that we're seeing in the portfolio. Yeah, I'm going to come back, Dominick, because the last half of your question. I wasn't sure I followed it. But in terms of unused lines, one of our long-standing strategies has been to start people with smaller lines and allow them to grow. And so, I would say, I wouldn't expect a meaningful shift in that strategy solely in the service of risk-weighted assets. So overall, though, as you look at the risk weightings that have come out in the end game proposal. For us, in aggregate, recall, we're not in mortgage or trading. So looking at the net of retail and commercial, inclusive of the gold plating, those are largely fighting to a draw in terms of overall risk-weighting impact, specifically on the asset side. Like everyone else, of course, we're going to have an impact from the operational risk RWA. But I didn't quite follow the second half of your question around ROTCEs. Could you just repeat that for me? Got it. Yeah, sorry, I didn't quite follow the second half of it. That was what I was trying to explain in my answer is, the net of all of that ultimately ends up being a wash, the part where we will be holding more capital on the denominator side, strictly for the risk-weighting assets again, I should highlight that it's in a comment period, a lot of industry focus on it and well, particularly as it relates to the opt risk calculation, there could be material impacts on the final outcome relative to what's proposed. But taking what is currently proposed, the asset side specifically outside of the operational risk ends up being roughly a draw for us, and it's really just the operational risk that's going to require us to hold more capital. Yeah, Dominick. I can't remember who asked it earlier, but just reiterating some of those points, I think you largely answered your own question, which is there is seasonality that in part is -- or is a function of the revolve rates driven by some of the dynamics, Rich talked about over the course of the year, we did see the Fed move. And then we also saw a bit of late fees, which I would lump into the seasonality dimension. And then finally, we had one more day in the third quarter, so day count in an absolute sense, not necessarily relative to peers, which I think was the nature of the question earlier, but at least in an absolute sense. Those are the big drivers of what drove the quarter-over-quarter yield."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead. \nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Amy, and welcome, everybody, to Capital One's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we are webcasting live over the internet. To access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. \n In addition to the press release and the financials, we have included a presentation summarizing our second quarter 2023 results. \n With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through the presentation.

Andrew? \nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.2 billion were up 7% compared to the first quarter and 16% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by tax-related outflows. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew 1% to end the quarter at 79% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. \n Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense was $2.5 billion, with $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $318 million. \n Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $318 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.6 billion as of June 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.7%, up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. \n In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $544 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 12 basis points to 7.78%. Three factors impacted the allowance in the quarter. The predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about $5 billion in the quarter. The second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of 2024 as part of our 12-month reasonable and supportable period. These 2 factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook, which still assumes a worsening from today's level. but less so than our outlook a quarter ago. \n In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $20 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio was essentially flat at 2.83%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance decreased by $218 million. In the quarter, we moved approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk. With that move, we recognized charge-offs that were already largely reflected in our allowance, which was the primary factor driving this quarter's decrease. The decrease in allowance from moving these loans to HFS was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio. We have provided additional details on our Commercial Office portfolio in the appendix of tonight's presentation. The coverage ratio in the Commercial business decreased by 20 basis points and now stands at 1.62%. \n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 150%, up from 148% last quarter and 144% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $9 billion to $118 billion, driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at $42 billion, down about $5 billion from the prior quarter. We are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter. The preliminary average quarterly NSFR for both the first and second quarters was 134%, well above the 100% regulatory minimum. \n Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.48%, 12 basis points lower than last quarter, and 6 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields. That impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.7%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the $150 million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter. \n At the end of the second quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $7.6 billion. If we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.4%. \n During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 4.8%, resulting in a total Fed capital requirement of 9.3%. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? \nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. The Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 7% from the second quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $21 billion or about 18% year-over-year. And second quarter revenue was also up 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 40 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 17.76%. \n The decline was driven by 2 factors: first, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate. \n The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 212 basis points year-over-year to 4.38%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 139 basis points from the prior year to 3.74% and is now above its June 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't quite caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we expect the monthly charge-off rate will reach 2019 levels in the third quarter. \n Noninterest expense was up 8% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was down about 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $886 million. In most years, marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. In 2022, that pattern was less pronounced. In 2023, our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern. \n Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing, and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. And as always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. \n We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in Domestic Card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business, and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. \n Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, auto originations declined 31% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $4.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 1%. We posted another quarter of strong year-over-year retail deposit growth. Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $30 billion or 12% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were down about 2%, largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. \n Consumer Banking revenue was up 8% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was down about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.40%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.38%, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. \n Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were down 2%. Average loans were down 1%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that Andrew discussed. \n Ending deposits were down 4% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 5%. We saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business-as-usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selective, less attractive commercial deposit balances. \n Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about 9% from the linked quarter. Second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the Commercial Office portfolio, inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate increased to 1.62% in the second quarter. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.73%, down 58 basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 10 basis points to 0.89%. \n In closing, we continued to deliver top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient Domestic Card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank. And we continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. \n Pulling way up, Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. \n Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? \nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session [Operator Instructions]. Amy, please start the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: Maybe to start on the margin, Andrew, where we saw some pressure. Can you maybe just talk about how to think about the margin from here? You talked about card loan run faster, which is a tailwind. But there's obviously -- rising deposit cost has been headwind. So when you put it all together, what do you see the trajectory of the margin shaking out? And embedded within that, what are your most updated expectations for deposit betas at this point? And I have a follow-up question. \nAndrew Young: Sure. So why don't I start with the deposit beta speech Ryan, since that will feed into the NIM. As we talked about last quarter and you see playing out in the marketplace at this point, there's just a number of factors that are impacting beta between product mix and the competitive dynamics on pricing, just how quickly the Fed has moved over the last 5 quarters. All of this happening under the backdrop of QT. And so we put that on top of our view for deposits all of the needs that we have, our desire to grow customer relationships and the like. And so those forces, coupled with the fact that at this point in the cycle, deposit pricing just tends to lag yields. \n And so you've seen our betas continue to rise over the last few quarters. I talked about the last cycle us being in the low 40s. And a quarter ago, I said you should expect us to kind of move up from where we were. We are now in the 52% range. I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be upward pressure on beta from here given all of the factors that I just described. \n So why don't I then start on your question about NIM with headwinds That, of course, would be one, the beta lag as well as what we're seeing in the wholesale funding market, spreads are a little bit wider. So just overall funding costs, I think, would probably be a headwind. And then we're also seeing credit continue to normalize. Rich touched in his talking points around card margin. So revenue suppression would be another headwind, all else equal. But we do see at least a few tailwinds, one being the level of revolve rate in card in the second quarter tends to be seasonally lower. And just on a longer-term basis, the current run rate has been lower over the last couple of years. So both of those factors could be driving card margin up. \n I also think that when you look at our cash position, cash is likely to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This quarter, we saw ending cash come down. Average cash was largely flat since we had built up, cash over the course of the first quarter. But I think you should expect that cash will remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic but over time, it probably will come down at least modestly from here. And then the last thing is in the back half of the year, we'll have an extra day in the quarter. So as we move into Q3, that will be a definitive tailwind. \n So those are what I would enumerate as the primary forces at play. And so one of the big ones that's going to drive the trajectory is really what ends up happening to beta. \nRyan Nash: Got it. And then Rich, maybe as my follow-up, maybe just an update on what you're seeing with the consumer. When I look in the credit -- in the card book, delinquencies in the past 4 months have been rising, let's call it, 130, 140 basis points per year. And given all the growth that has come on to the books in the past 24 months, can you give us a sense for how to think about how far past 2024 level -- 2019 levels, we could be going on losses and maybe, Andrew tie in, what this all can mean for the allowance over time? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So just to put some numbers behind your comments. So the Domestic Card delinquencies in the second quarter were about 10% higher than the same quarter of 2019. Our charge-offs are still a bit below their 2019 levels. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back there in the next few months. \n So when you interpret our credit metrics, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. There is one effect that is increasing our loss rate that is probably more pronounced for Capital One, at least for a time, which is related to our recovery. Past charge-offs are the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than for most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they tend to come in over time, not all at once, which happens in a debt sale. \n Also, we have to remember that the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented. So we believe there's some catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. So we call this sort of the deferred charge-off effect. It's something that really can't be measured. We won't even be able to measure it in hindsight, how big this effect is, but it's intuitively sort of the reverse of the effect we saw in the Global Financial Crisis, which in many ways, just pulled forward charge-offs for lots of folks that were in a vulnerable position. And then what we saw in the aftermath of that for those that -- and weathered that, we just saw strikingly low charge-offs. \n So I think really what -- kind of what's going on with this whole sort of normalization in the context of such extraordinarily low unemployment rates, I think an important part here is sort of this deferred charge-off effect. And so that's the dynamic we see going on in our business. We continue to feel very good about the credit performance. We're not giving guidance on predicting the level, but we continue to lean into our growth opportunities because the metrics we see are very solid. \nAndrew Young: And then with respect to the allowance, Ryan, I know I've talked a lot about the mechanics in recent calls, so I'll spare all of you the tutorial. But the first thing with respect to the allowance will obviously be allowing for future growth is an obvious contributor to where the allowance goes from here. But then it's really all about the outlook for losses and in particular, what we're projecting for loss rates a year out. So Rich just described a lot of the dynamics that are at play with our outlook for [ client ] losses. So depending on how all those factors play out, that's really going to have the biggest impact, especially as you look out well into '24. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Shane with JPMorgan. \nRichard Shane: Rich, I would describe that I think one of the hallmarks of Capital One over the decades as almost a strategic optimism. When you look at opportunities right now and where your peers are deploying capital, where is your greatest strategic optimism? \nRichard Fairbank: My greatest strategic optimism, Richard, is in the card business. We've -- first of all, we've always been a big fan of the card business starting from the beginning of the company. It's not an accident that we chose the card business because we love the industry structure. We love the opportunity to leverage kind of strategies that we wanted to put in place, the information-based, technology-based strategies. And while that is something one can apply across all of financial services, it certainly has tremendous leverage in a business like the card business. So we've always loved the business. \n As you know, kind of, you've followed us for a long time, Richard, we -- just because we love a business, doesn't mean we constantly have our foot on the accelerator. So we very much look at the industry structure and then look at the marketplace and make our choices. We -- often, we end up zigging while others zag, as you have seen in the past. \n We feel very good about the opportunities in the card business for several reasons. I think, well, first of all, just the health of the consumer, just consumer credit is in a very good place. The consumer is in an exceptionally strong place. And I think that gives a foundation of strength even in the context of an economy that's got some concerning aspects to it. Then we look at the competitive environment, I think the competition is intense in card, but it is rational. We see people making credit choices. And just when we look at the competition, and this isn't always true in banking, but I think we see a rational industry making rational choices. And so I think the credit that is being delivered to the consumer is balance to the appetite, and so we feel good about the competitive environment. \n We look at margins and where they are. They are strong. The credit environment, as we talked about in my answer to Ryan Nash, credit losses are increasing. I think there's a catch-up sort of delayed charge-off effect. But when we look at the metrics, the metrics on recent originations, the metrics on our back book with respect to performance of existing accounts, credit line increases, we just see strength across the board. So we feel very good about that and we look at our marketing programs, and they continue to generate a lot of new accounts. And so pulling way up on that, we like the metrics, we like the results of our programs, and we like the marketplace in credit. \n And if I cross-calibrate to other parts of the marketplace. The auto business, even while we've been leaning into card, we have been -- had more of our foot on the brake over the last 18 months in the auto business for a number of factors, but probably the biggest one being what was happening on the pricing side and the difficulty in passing through increases in cost of funds. That aspect has normalized mostly in the market. The auto business has still some unique aspects to it that we got to keep an eye on used car prices, and they've been elevated. They're likely to fall over time. And so -- but all in all, we see opportunity maybe expanding a little bit in the auto space, but we'll have to keep an eye on that. But in the very recent sort of months, we've seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more. \n And then on the commercial side of the business, obviously, our biggest focus has been on the office portfolio and Capital One, again, tends to take a different path than a lot of companies do. But we -- I think for a lot of banks, they tend to -- when they look at the credit environment when they see credit that is worsening in a particular sector, they tend to pull back on originations, which makes a lot of sense. We often see one more notch on the continuum, which is to look at the assets that we have and look from time to time at, in fact, selling those. We have -- over the last few years, we have actually unloaded something like -- this is -- well, something like $6 billion of loans. That's not an official -- Andrew is the one who gives the precise numbers. What I'm saying is several billion dollars of sort of exiting that we have done. Now in this particular case, we look at the market and see a lot of sustained stress in that market and feel that when we have an opportunity to relieve some of the higher stress aspects of that business, we took that opportunity. \n So pulling way up, you see at Capital One, we -- for some of our business, we have our foot on the brake and for other parts of the company, our foot is on the gas. But where I would leave you, the net impression I would lead you it is really on the card side, that we're really leaning in the hardest. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to start maybe with expenses. It has come in a little bit better than I think what we were expecting, they were down quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned -- you talked a little bit about returning to normal in your prepared remarks. And I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Was there a decision like to slow down on growth investments, pullback? Like, I guess, what changed just in terms of the expenses or the cadence of expenses through the year? \nAndrew Young: Typically, Mihir, I'll take that one if you're talking just Q1 to Q2. In the first quarter, we typically have seasonal effects to compensation when bonuses are paid, payroll tax issues. You see that in the ST&B, Salary Tax and Benefit line there. So that's really the largest single factor, not necessarily a fundamental shift in any trajectory. \nMihir Bhatia: Okay. And then maybe just going back to the NIM conversation. I think you talked about some of the puts and takes in the near term. But I was curious just about company-wide NIM or compared to historical, right, I mean, it wasn't atypical for Capital One's NIM to be closer to 7%, high 6s. Do you expect you'll get back there? Or have something fundamentally changed in the business, whether it's the growth in the high balance transactors or something else where you wouldn't get back there? \nAndrew Young: Well, I don't think there's anything fundamentally different in the business, Mihir. I think there's a lot of question around what happens to consumer behavior when we talked about revolve rate in card and other things. And then also on the funding side, partially dependent on what the Fed ends up doing over an extended period of time where rates eventually settle out. I think those are all factors that could ultimately impact where the final resting place is for NIM, but there's nothing that is really fundamentally different across our book from where it was years ago. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck: So I know, Rich, you mentioned marketing following the typical seasonality this year, and still expecting it to ramp up in the back half, which makes a lot of sense. And I'm just wondering, when you think about where you want to spend those dollars, is it more on new account acquisition, spurring outstanding loan utilization, is travel a relatively easier one to pull at this stage? And I guess what I'm just wondering is, is there an opportunity to even get more return for your marketing dollars now versus maybe what you've had over the past couple of quarters given the need for people to borrow perhaps more than they had to a year ago? So just those are some of the questions that I had. \nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Betsy. Let me talk about the marketing, yes, thanks for commenting about the seasonality. I mean every year is different in terms of the quarterly patterns. But we pointed out this year is, it seems like a more normal year with the back half, with the more common back half, higher back half than we've had in some of the anomalous times during the pandemic. The marketing was flat compared -- in this quarter, was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 12% year-over-year. But I wouldn't draw really strong conclusions from that because as I already talked about, we're leaning into the marketing. It's just from a timing point of view of some of our marketing, it was just didn't happen to fall as much in this quarter. \n And let me talk about the opportunities that we see and why we're investing heavily in marketing, really, first of all, we just see attractive growth opportunities across our business. Particularly in the card business, we've continued to expand our products and our marketing channels. We're seeing very good traction. These opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation that enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and provide customized solutions that continues to just generate very good performance, and we're leaning in to capitalize on that. So sort of category one is just the good opportunities that we see. \n The second thing that's behind our marketing levels is something we've been talking about for a long time, which is our ongoing focus on heavy spenders. And it was really back in 2010 that we declared a strategic push for heavy spenders. And we knew in looking at the business that, that's not a thing that we can go lean in one year, pull back another year. This is a whole part of the marketplace, which is about commitment. It's about building exceptional experiences, great products and the brand. \n So starting really with the venture launch way back in 2010, we've been leaning in hard there. But of course, it hasn't just been about flagship cards. It's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and investing across really the digital experience, the servicing experience, the lifestyle and product experiences as well. And what's been nice about this is that we've and you've seen in our purchase volume growth, a lot of growth of purchase volume, but another strong manifestation of this is the rate of growth year after year has been higher at the higher end than the average. So we continue to get increased traction going up and up in the pursuit of heavy spenders. \n Now, of course, heavy spenders have much higher upfront cost of marketing, promotions, brand building. And hence, it's a big factor in why the marketing levels at Capital One, if you compare back to many years ago, they're sort of structurally higher but that's in pursuit of this really, I think, company transforming benefits that we're getting there. \n A third factor driving our marketing levels, Betsy, is our continuing investment in building our national retail bank. As you know, we have only a modest presence in terms of physical distribution. And so to get there, we lean heavily on our modern technology and a compelling digital experience and along with that, a sustained investment in marketing. So that's a bit about what's behind our marketing levels that you're seeing and the opportunities we see. And if we really look across those 3 sort of buckets, just the growth opportunities we see, the opportunities in building the heavy spender franchise and then the building of the national bank being sort of the one bank that's building a full-service bank without trying to do it via a branch on every corner, all of this marketing is the engine behind this, and we continue to lean into it and be very pleased with the performance. \nBetsy Graseck: And its growth rate expectations should be following similar patterns to the pre-COVID environment? \nRichard Fairbank: Well, let me comment for a second. Well, let me first say, we're not really giving growth outlook. The thing I really want to say about marketing is marketing drives the origination of accounts. The real growth of our card business comes really from balanced growth and also from purchase volume growth, of course. But those are not one-for-one things. But what we have been focused on since the founding of the company is building a company that has an organic growth engine focused on originations and leveraging the technology and analytical capabilities that we built. And so our -- when you see our leaning in hard to marketing. Think about that is the engine that's driving new accounts. And over time, those accounts really are, to your point, even though the timing is not one-for-one, those accounts are really the foundation for the continued outstandings and revenue growth of the company. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Andrew, I hate to do this, but I want to go back to the allowance coverage trends going forward. If we zoom into that complex calculation of removing previous and adding future quarters of net charge-offs. In your current forecast, do you have losses sort of rising through the end of next year? And maybe you could just touch on the new macro baseline and what the unemployment rate assumption is? \nAndrew Young: Yes. So the baseline assumption and our outlook focusing, I imagine you're looking mostly for unemployment rate. So we have it increasing from the 3.6% it is today to 4.3% at the end of this year and then moving higher in the 4s, but staying in the 4s through 2024. That compares to our assumption last quarter of, I believe, it was 5.1%. But remember that our models tend to use the change in unemployment rates or the rate of job creation, which we're forecasting to come down to nearly 0, rather than the level of unemployment. And so it's not just about those factors, too, in our allowance. We're also considering downside scenarios that are much more severe than that baseline. \n So when you take that into account to your first question around what are we assuming, I'm not going to give specific forecast. Rich listed out kind of the factors that we believe will create upward pressure on our loss rates in the near term, at least. And so we did assume that there's higher losses in the second quarter of next year than the quarter that we just left sort of mechanically, as I described this quarter's allowance. But where that goes from here is just so heavily assumption-laden focused on the back half of the year, I'd really focus your attention much more to delinquencies as the leading indicator to charge-offs, especially in the near term because that's where the economics ultimately are felt as opposed to the allowance that is going to move quarter-to-quarter based on assumptions looking many quarters into the future. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Rich, I asked this question to one of your competitors earlier. But can you just pinpoint what's exactly attractive about the growth you're seeing in card today versus in the past? They are also growing at a pretty rapid rate. And obviously, you guys have been very successful at growing this business over time, but the market remains competitive. You talked about the credit normalization. There's obviously a potential for economic challenges. I'm just trying to think through the risks. \nRichard Fairbank: So Sanjay, there certainly are things to be worried about. The economy is unusual and has aspects of a lot of strength and a lot of concern. The credit normalization, we all see it. And so I'm going to make the worry case just slightly here for a second, the credit normalization has -- credit is still at very attractive levels, but it still has an upward slope to it, and nobody -- well, we certainly don't feel in a position to predict exactly where that settles out. And so we'll have to keep that very much front and center. And the market is very competitive, absolutely. \n So at a time like this, we -- so -- well, on the strong side, I start with the health of the consumer. So let's just think about this because the U.S. consumer is a real source of relative strength in this uncertain economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year. And there are signs of cooling, but so far, they're playing out gradually without abrupt or severe job losses that we see in severe downturns. \n Another striking thing, the debt servicing burdens remain low by historical standards despite rising interest rates. Home prices have started to tick back up after falling for a while and we've talked a lot about consumers and their excess savings that they built up through the pandemic. And they still have some excess savings, although that buffer is shrinking. And for many consumers, I think it's been fully consumed by higher prices. \n The big negative, back to negatives, the big negative out there has been inflation and real wages have been pushed down since really over the last couple of years and consumer confidence, that's been pretty shaky. \n But on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape. So then we also believe when the -- we have believed for quite a while, you remember in our conversations, even as the losses are rising these days, because we do believe that the deferred charge-off phenomenon is something that is very natural to occur, we're not alarmed to buy where losses are going. Then we look at our own metrics and if we -- obviously, we've talked about delinquencies. We've talked about charge-offs. We also look at payment rates and revolve rates. And I just want to make a comment about payment rates. I'm struck by the strength in payment rates. Throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increase, not only for us but across the industry. And more recently, very naturally, payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs but -- and you can see in our trust metrics, the pretty whopping payment rates that's still there. \n I guess what I'm struck by is that payment rates not only overall for Capital One, which could definitely has a mix shift toward heavy spenders as potentially driving that. But even when we look by segment, we're struck by the continuing relative strength in payment rates. So that's a good guy. \n And probably the biggest factor that we look at is the recent originations, the vintage curve performance. And the overall level of risk that we're seeing so far in our new originations is consistent with -- certainly consistent with our expectations, but also on a comparative basis. When we look at the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of originations, we see performance that is consistent with pre-pandemic risk levels in each of our major segments. And vintage over vintage, we're also seeing relatively stable risk levels over time. \n Now one thing I want to say, and Sanjay, you remember, we've talked about this. There's 2 ways you can -- this can happen. One is the sort of unmanaged and the other is the managed way. My favorite way is when vintage performance with the same credit policies as several years ago, when that is on top of the old things, the old originations from years ago, that's actually not the case on what we call a like-for-like basis. The recent originations have worse credit than they had years ago. Again, not surprising at all to us. We all along the way, have been managing reactively and proactively around the edges where we either see or would expect maybe performance to be not as good. And the -- and so we have trimmed around the edges in our originations. And so on a net basis, it is sort of just happens to be that originations these days are on top of where they were several years ago. \n So pulling way up and based on, for me, more than 3 decades of experience of doing this in the card business, the opportunities that we see and enhanced by a lot of technology innovations and things like that, we see it as a good time to keep leaning in. We have a very watchful eye on all those negatives that you and I talked about. But on a calibration basis, I would -- I like the opportunity. \n I just want to say one more thing, which you are right. A lot of times, we have leaned in when others are pulling back. As a general observation, most of the industry is leaning in. That gets our attention. It's not as sustainable often when that's the case. So we're going to watch it carefully. But that gave you a little window into how we're looking at this and the optimism that we feel at this moment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. \nDonald Fandetti: Yes. Rich, can you talk about what you're seeing on credit card spend growth rates recently in terms of the like-for-like account basis, I know it was sort of flat to down last quarter. And do you think that we'll continue to see moderation? \nRichard Fairbank: So let's pull up, first of all, our Domestic Card purchase volume was up 7% year-over-year. But that's -- to your question, Don, that's really powered by the growth in our customer base. When you look at spend per customer, this has moderated and is now generally flat from a year ago. And the moderation in spending appears to be broad-based. We've observed it across income bands and card segments. We've also seen it across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. \n By the way, it's not surprising at all that this would sort of level out. The consumer pulled way back in the pandemic, just an unprecedented amount of pullback and now -- and sort of has come roaring back on the other side. But I think for the individual customer, things are sort of settling out. So I think when we ask what would we wish for, I think this is a sensible -- like so often, I always say that's the most sensible constituency in all of the marketplace tends to yet again be the consumer. \n But overall, we think that spend moderation is the sign of a rational and healthy behavior on the part of the consumer. And then we match it with the payment rates, and those are, look, those are normalizing somewhat. The revolve rates are normalizing somewhat, but both the payment rate and the revolve rates on a segment-by-segment basis are still not there. They're not at the pre-pandemic levels yet, which indicates an underlying strength, at least on average, even when maybe at the margin, you're seeing some of these deferred charge-offs that are driving up credit losses. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. \n Our last question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. \nDominick Gabriele: Rich, I was just thinking about turns in the credit cycle. What are some of the mistakes that you think card issuers make and even lenders in general? And where do you look for the weakness in the overall space of lending to give you caution when you start to see that turns in the credit cycle? And I also have a follow-up. \nRichard Fairbank: So yes, it's -- I really appreciate the question, Dominick, because I've often said, we're not in a position, I wouldn't have any of you put any more stock or stake. I guess you investors put stock in, but I wouldn't put any particular stake in our ability to predict the economy. But the credit cycle and the economy are not the same thing. They're correlated, but I think that the credit cycle is the thing that we really focus a lot on because I think a lot of elements of it are pretty predictable. Obviously, it is influenced by and influences the economy. \n So let's sort of pull way up. We were in this extraordinary period no one has ever seen before in terms of the credit quality during the pandemic. And we enjoyed and our investors enjoyed the high returns that we made in that time. But some of you may remember my saying, be careful what you wish for, because with every passing month that this cycle is abnormally good, we will pay the price later on the other side of that causally because what -- and so if you get into the behavior, and it really links not so much at all to the behavior of consumers, it's really about kind of to your question, what happens to lenders, providers of credit in -- at this part of the cycle, especially in an extreme thing. \n And we saw alarming things happening during the most extreme periods during the pandemic. The most striking one to me was the absolute surge in FinTech lending, how much of it there was, who knows, because most of them aren't reporting to the credit bureaus so it's just a matter of trying to infer what's going on. But -- so there was a big surge in supply, particularly to subprime, which is where almost all FinTechs go after. And that was alarming to us. And we felt with every month that, that supply keeps coming, as I said earlier, there's a price to be paid. \n Then you look -- then we look at the context of overlay on top of that, the -- to your question about the common mistakes, what the FinTechs almost by definition were doing because I'm not sure what else they would do, is they were leveraging technology building models in a lot of cases, but the rearview mirror that they were looking into the data set their models had were the greatest credit economy in the history of lending. \n So that's a dangerous kind of data set for the models. It was exacerbated by credit scores that had drifted dramatically more, a lot of subprime customers moving into prime just by sort of the way scoring works and what was happening as a result of the savings rates going up for consumers. \n So the -- so with FinTechs, particularly but for all the players in the business, the danger of the rearview mirror, the danger of the misreading the credit risk of customers because they were artificially, their scores would be artificially good. By the way, in our case, we pretty much just intervened in our own modeling and created a way to assume worse than the data says. We also, in our case, put heavy reliance on data and modeling from way back in the last few decades that allows us to sort of get past that. \n So that -- it's primarily the overexuberance of lenders in the environment of a combination of a great rearview mirror and frankly, a lot of extra earnings, and feeling the ability to deploy a bunch of that into marketing. \n Now what's happened since then? I think this sort of great normalization has been a very healthy thing. It would be shocking if it didn't happen. But from a health of the industry point of view, I think it's a very good thing. \n Obviously, the FinTechs -- FinTech lending has gone way. Most of it is retreated significantly. I am struck -- my earlier comment as we watch very carefully the credit card industry, I think the major players seem to be pretty rational about the credit choices they make. And now for everybody with charge-offs rising and without leveling necessarily manifesting itself, I think it's bringing back the appropriate cautions in time for a softer landing here than might otherwise have been there. \n So those are some of the thoughts that we have and those are things to keep an eye on. One other thing that I just sort of seize a moment here on things that are on our mind because I always try -- to my goal here is to always give you a window into how we're thinking and what net impression do I want folks to come away with, as we look at opportunities and a thing that's very much on our mind is the CFPB efforts on late fees. And I just want to just comment on that because that it's a very important thing that's going on. \n The CFPB late fee proposal effectively reduces late fees by approximately 75%. And the CFPB is going after the fee that we believe is the most important fee in consumer credit business. Late fees provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid becoming delinquent and damaging their credit records. And a small late fee may not have that deterrent effect. Late fees are also a way that issuers can partially price for risk, and this enables greater access -- for consumers, greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average. \n A reduction in late fees is almost certain to reduce credit access to certain parts of the population. And the CFPB proposal is, of course, not yet finalized, and it could be subject to delays or changes due to litigation. But we have to plan for the potential of this becoming law early next year. And Capital One has pursued a strategy of offering very simple credit card products with limited fees and complexity. And ironically, the late fee has been an important part of our product structure because of the reasons that I cited earlier. \n If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our revenue, gradually resolving over time. And there are ways to mitigate the impact, but as a practical matter, those solutions will take several years to work their way through the portfolio. \n So as we pull up and I share with you how we're thinking of the business, we really like the opportunities in the card marketplace we -- for all the reasons that I've talked about, but we also need to really stare at this proposal that may become the rule of the land and I just wanted to share with you how we're thinking about that. And that's an important focus of Capital One. And our solutions to that will be very focused on finding solutions that are consistent with maintaining a winning customer franchise, and that's a thing that takes time to work its way in. \n Do you have another question, Dominick, you wanted to ask? \nDominick Gabriele: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I can't agree with you more on the late fee comments as well, especially access to credit, makes perfect sense. This one is not as interesting. I guess I was just looking for some help on the model. When you look at professional fees or professional service expense, it was down pretty big year-over-year while the salaries were maybe a little elevated versus seasonality. I was wondering if you brought some of those folks in-house or how to think about the professional services given that is some of the debt collection piece, I believe. And then was there a gain in the other noninterest income from the sold portfolio? Any help there would be great. And thanks for everything and the comments. \nAndrew Young: Sure. So I think you've got it right in terms of looking at salaries and benefits in professional services in conjunction with one another as we were making substantial investments in technology we were supplementing that with some third-party resources. We brought that down as we've been able to use our brand -- our recruiting brand to bring incredible talent into the organization. And so it's really looking in some ways at those 2 lines in conjunction with one another to get a sense for the kind of underlying overall labor trend. And then in other noninterest income, no, it's -- well, not specifically a sale, one of the biggest things in that creates some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is agency income in our commercial business. So it's a little bit lumpy, but we saw some real strength in the quarter, and so that's what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase there. \nJeff Norris: Well, that concludes our Q&A session and our call for this evening. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. The Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer further questions you may have. Have a good night, everybody. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. The Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 7% from the second quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $21 billion or about 18% year-over-year. And second quarter revenue was also up 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 40 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 17.76%. \n The decline was driven by 2 factors: first, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate. \n The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 212 basis points year-over-year to 4.38%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 139 basis points from the prior year to 3.74% and is now above its June 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't quite caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we expect the monthly charge-off rate will reach 2019 levels in the third quarter. \n Noninterest expense was up 8% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was down about 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $886 million. In most years, marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. In 2022, that pattern was less pronounced. In 2023, our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern. \n Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing, and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. And as always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. \n We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in Domestic Card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business, and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. \n Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, auto originations declined 31% year-over-year. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $4.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 1%. We posted another quarter of strong year-over-year retail deposit growth. Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $30 billion or 12% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were down about 2%, largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. \n Consumer Banking revenue was up 8% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was down about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.40%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.38%, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. \n Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were down 2%. Average loans were down 1%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that Andrew discussed. \n Ending deposits were down 4% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 5%. We saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business-as-usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selective, less attractive commercial deposit balances. \n Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about 9% from the linked quarter. Second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the Commercial Office portfolio, inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate increased to 1.62% in the second quarter. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.73%, down 58 basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 10 basis points to 0.89%. \n In closing, we continued to deliver top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient Domestic Card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank. And we continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. \n Pulling way up, Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. \n Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So just to put some numbers behind your comments. So the Domestic Card delinquencies in the second quarter were about 10% higher than the same quarter of 2019. Our charge-offs are still a bit below their 2019 levels. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back there in the next few months. \n So when you interpret our credit metrics, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. There is one effect that is increasing our loss rate that is probably more pronounced for Capital One, at least for a time, which is related to our recovery. Past charge-offs are the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than for most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they tend to come in over time, not all at once, which happens in a debt sale. \n Also, we have to remember that the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented. So we believe there's some catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. So we call this sort of the deferred charge-off effect. It's something that really can't be measured. We won't even be able to measure it in hindsight, how big this effect is, but it's intuitively sort of the reverse of the effect we saw in the Global Financial Crisis, which in many ways, just pulled forward charge-offs for lots of folks that were in a vulnerable position. And then what we saw in the aftermath of that for those that -- and weathered that, we just saw strikingly low charge-offs. \n So I think really what -- kind of what's going on with this whole sort of normalization in the context of such extraordinarily low unemployment rates, I think an important part here is sort of this deferred charge-off effect. And so that's the dynamic we see going on in our business. We continue to feel very good about the credit performance. We're not giving guidance on predicting the level, but we continue to lean into our growth opportunities because the metrics we see are very solid. My greatest strategic optimism, Richard, is in the card business. We've -- first of all, we've always been a big fan of the card business starting from the beginning of the company. It's not an accident that we chose the card business because we love the industry structure. We love the opportunity to leverage kind of strategies that we wanted to put in place, the information-based, technology-based strategies. And while that is something one can apply across all of financial services, it certainly has tremendous leverage in a business like the card business. So we've always loved the business. \n As you know, kind of, you've followed us for a long time, Richard, we -- just because we love a business, doesn't mean we constantly have our foot on the accelerator. So we very much look at the industry structure and then look at the marketplace and make our choices. We -- often, we end up zigging while others zag, as you have seen in the past. \n We feel very good about the opportunities in the card business for several reasons. I think, well, first of all, just the health of the consumer, just consumer credit is in a very good place. The consumer is in an exceptionally strong place. And I think that gives a foundation of strength even in the context of an economy that's got some concerning aspects to it. Then we look at the competitive environment, I think the competition is intense in card, but it is rational. We see people making credit choices. And just when we look at the competition, and this isn't always true in banking, but I think we see a rational industry making rational choices. And so I think the credit that is being delivered to the consumer is balance to the appetite, and so we feel good about the competitive environment. \n We look at margins and where they are. They are strong. The credit environment, as we talked about in my answer to Ryan Nash, credit losses are increasing. I think there's a catch-up sort of delayed charge-off effect. But when we look at the metrics, the metrics on recent originations, the metrics on our back book with respect to performance of existing accounts, credit line increases, we just see strength across the board. So we feel very good about that and we look at our marketing programs, and they continue to generate a lot of new accounts. And so pulling way up on that, we like the metrics, we like the results of our programs, and we like the marketplace in credit. \n And if I cross-calibrate to other parts of the marketplace. The auto business, even while we've been leaning into card, we have been -- had more of our foot on the brake over the last 18 months in the auto business for a number of factors, but probably the biggest one being what was happening on the pricing side and the difficulty in passing through increases in cost of funds. That aspect has normalized mostly in the market. The auto business has still some unique aspects to it that we got to keep an eye on used car prices, and they've been elevated. They're likely to fall over time. And so -- but all in all, we see opportunity maybe expanding a little bit in the auto space, but we'll have to keep an eye on that. But in the very recent sort of months, we've seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more. \n And then on the commercial side of the business, obviously, our biggest focus has been on the office portfolio and Capital One, again, tends to take a different path than a lot of companies do. But we -- I think for a lot of banks, they tend to -- when they look at the credit environment when they see credit that is worsening in a particular sector, they tend to pull back on originations, which makes a lot of sense. We often see one more notch on the continuum, which is to look at the assets that we have and look from time to time at, in fact, selling those. We have -- over the last few years, we have actually unloaded something like -- this is -- well, something like $6 billion of loans. That's not an official -- Andrew is the one who gives the precise numbers. What I'm saying is several billion dollars of sort of exiting that we have done. Now in this particular case, we look at the market and see a lot of sustained stress in that market and feel that when we have an opportunity to relieve some of the higher stress aspects of that business, we took that opportunity. \n So pulling way up, you see at Capital One, we -- for some of our business, we have our foot on the brake and for other parts of the company, our foot is on the gas. But where I would leave you, the net impression I would lead you it is really on the card side, that we're really leaning in the hardest. Thanks, Betsy. Let me talk about the marketing, yes, thanks for commenting about the seasonality. I mean every year is different in terms of the quarterly patterns. But we pointed out this year is, it seems like a more normal year with the back half, with the more common back half, higher back half than we've had in some of the anomalous times during the pandemic. The marketing was flat compared -- in this quarter, was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 12% year-over-year. But I wouldn't draw really strong conclusions from that because as I already talked about, we're leaning into the marketing. It's just from a timing point of view of some of our marketing, it was just didn't happen to fall as much in this quarter. \n And let me talk about the opportunities that we see and why we're investing heavily in marketing, really, first of all, we just see attractive growth opportunities across our business. Particularly in the card business, we've continued to expand our products and our marketing channels. We're seeing very good traction. These opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation that enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and provide customized solutions that continues to just generate very good performance, and we're leaning in to capitalize on that. So sort of category one is just the good opportunities that we see. \n The second thing that's behind our marketing levels is something we've been talking about for a long time, which is our ongoing focus on heavy spenders. And it was really back in 2010 that we declared a strategic push for heavy spenders. And we knew in looking at the business that, that's not a thing that we can go lean in one year, pull back another year. This is a whole part of the marketplace, which is about commitment. It's about building exceptional experiences, great products and the brand. \n So starting really with the venture launch way back in 2010, we've been leaning in hard there. But of course, it hasn't just been about flagship cards. It's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and investing across really the digital experience, the servicing experience, the lifestyle and product experiences as well. And what's been nice about this is that we've and you've seen in our purchase volume growth, a lot of growth of purchase volume, but another strong manifestation of this is the rate of growth year after year has been higher at the higher end than the average. So we continue to get increased traction going up and up in the pursuit of heavy spenders. \n Now, of course, heavy spenders have much higher upfront cost of marketing, promotions, brand building. And hence, it's a big factor in why the marketing levels at Capital One, if you compare back to many years ago, they're sort of structurally higher but that's in pursuit of this really, I think, company transforming benefits that we're getting there. \n A third factor driving our marketing levels, Betsy, is our continuing investment in building our national retail bank. As you know, we have only a modest presence in terms of physical distribution. And so to get there, we lean heavily on our modern technology and a compelling digital experience and along with that, a sustained investment in marketing. So that's a bit about what's behind our marketing levels that you're seeing and the opportunities we see. And if we really look across those 3 sort of buckets, just the growth opportunities we see, the opportunities in building the heavy spender franchise and then the building of the national bank being sort of the one bank that's building a full-service bank without trying to do it via a branch on every corner, all of this marketing is the engine behind this, and we continue to lean into it and be very pleased with the performance. Well, let me comment for a second. Well, let me first say, we're not really giving growth outlook. The thing I really want to say about marketing is marketing drives the origination of accounts. The real growth of our card business comes really from balanced growth and also from purchase volume growth, of course. But those are not one-for-one things. But what we have been focused on since the founding of the company is building a company that has an organic growth engine focused on originations and leveraging the technology and analytical capabilities that we built. And so our -- when you see our leaning in hard to marketing. Think about that is the engine that's driving new accounts. And over time, those accounts really are, to your point, even though the timing is not one-for-one, those accounts are really the foundation for the continued outstandings and revenue growth of the company. So Sanjay, there certainly are things to be worried about. The economy is unusual and has aspects of a lot of strength and a lot of concern. The credit normalization, we all see it. And so I'm going to make the worry case just slightly here for a second, the credit normalization has -- credit is still at very attractive levels, but it still has an upward slope to it, and nobody -- well, we certainly don't feel in a position to predict exactly where that settles out. And so we'll have to keep that very much front and center. And the market is very competitive, absolutely. \n So at a time like this, we -- so -- well, on the strong side, I start with the health of the consumer. So let's just think about this because the U.S. consumer is a real source of relative strength in this uncertain economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year. And there are signs of cooling, but so far, they're playing out gradually without abrupt or severe job losses that we see in severe downturns. \n Another striking thing, the debt servicing burdens remain low by historical standards despite rising interest rates. Home prices have started to tick back up after falling for a while and we've talked a lot about consumers and their excess savings that they built up through the pandemic. And they still have some excess savings, although that buffer is shrinking. And for many consumers, I think it's been fully consumed by higher prices. \n The big negative, back to negatives, the big negative out there has been inflation and real wages have been pushed down since really over the last couple of years and consumer confidence, that's been pretty shaky. \n But on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape. So then we also believe when the -- we have believed for quite a while, you remember in our conversations, even as the losses are rising these days, because we do believe that the deferred charge-off phenomenon is something that is very natural to occur, we're not alarmed to buy where losses are going. Then we look at our own metrics and if we -- obviously, we've talked about delinquencies. We've talked about charge-offs. We also look at payment rates and revolve rates. And I just want to make a comment about payment rates. I'm struck by the strength in payment rates. Throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increase, not only for us but across the industry. And more recently, very naturally, payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs but -- and you can see in our trust metrics, the pretty whopping payment rates that's still there. \n I guess what I'm struck by is that payment rates not only overall for Capital One, which could definitely has a mix shift toward heavy spenders as potentially driving that. But even when we look by segment, we're struck by the continuing relative strength in payment rates. So that's a good guy. \n And probably the biggest factor that we look at is the recent originations, the vintage curve performance. And the overall level of risk that we're seeing so far in our new originations is consistent with -- certainly consistent with our expectations, but also on a comparative basis. When we look at the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of originations, we see performance that is consistent with pre-pandemic risk levels in each of our major segments. And vintage over vintage, we're also seeing relatively stable risk levels over time. \n Now one thing I want to say, and Sanjay, you remember, we've talked about this. There's 2 ways you can -- this can happen. One is the sort of unmanaged and the other is the managed way. My favorite way is when vintage performance with the same credit policies as several years ago, when that is on top of the old things, the old originations from years ago, that's actually not the case on what we call a like-for-like basis. The recent originations have worse credit than they had years ago. Again, not surprising at all to us. We all along the way, have been managing reactively and proactively around the edges where we either see or would expect maybe performance to be not as good. And the -- and so we have trimmed around the edges in our originations. And so on a net basis, it is sort of just happens to be that originations these days are on top of where they were several years ago. \n So pulling way up and based on, for me, more than 3 decades of experience of doing this in the card business, the opportunities that we see and enhanced by a lot of technology innovations and things like that, we see it as a good time to keep leaning in. We have a very watchful eye on all those negatives that you and I talked about. But on a calibration basis, I would -- I like the opportunity. \n I just want to say one more thing, which you are right. A lot of times, we have leaned in when others are pulling back. As a general observation, most of the industry is leaning in. That gets our attention. It's not as sustainable often when that's the case. So we're going to watch it carefully. But that gave you a little window into how we're looking at this and the optimism that we feel at this moment. So let's pull up, first of all, our Domestic Card purchase volume was up 7% year-over-year. But that's -- to your question, Don, that's really powered by the growth in our customer base. When you look at spend per customer, this has moderated and is now generally flat from a year ago. And the moderation in spending appears to be broad-based. We've observed it across income bands and card segments. We've also seen it across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. \n By the way, it's not surprising at all that this would sort of level out. The consumer pulled way back in the pandemic, just an unprecedented amount of pullback and now -- and sort of has come roaring back on the other side. But I think for the individual customer, things are sort of settling out. So I think when we ask what would we wish for, I think this is a sensible -- like so often, I always say that's the most sensible constituency in all of the marketplace tends to yet again be the consumer. \n But overall, we think that spend moderation is the sign of a rational and healthy behavior on the part of the consumer. And then we match it with the payment rates, and those are, look, those are normalizing somewhat. The revolve rates are normalizing somewhat, but both the payment rate and the revolve rates on a segment-by-segment basis are still not there. They're not at the pre-pandemic levels yet, which indicates an underlying strength, at least on average, even when maybe at the margin, you're seeing some of these deferred charge-offs that are driving up credit losses. So yes, it's -- I really appreciate the question, Dominick, because I've often said, we're not in a position, I wouldn't have any of you put any more stock or stake. I guess you investors put stock in, but I wouldn't put any particular stake in our ability to predict the economy. But the credit cycle and the economy are not the same thing. They're correlated, but I think that the credit cycle is the thing that we really focus a lot on because I think a lot of elements of it are pretty predictable. Obviously, it is influenced by and influences the economy. \n So let's sort of pull way up. We were in this extraordinary period no one has ever seen before in terms of the credit quality during the pandemic. And we enjoyed and our investors enjoyed the high returns that we made in that time. But some of you may remember my saying, be careful what you wish for, because with every passing month that this cycle is abnormally good, we will pay the price later on the other side of that causally because what -- and so if you get into the behavior, and it really links not so much at all to the behavior of consumers, it's really about kind of to your question, what happens to lenders, providers of credit in -- at this part of the cycle, especially in an extreme thing. \n And we saw alarming things happening during the most extreme periods during the pandemic. The most striking one to me was the absolute surge in FinTech lending, how much of it there was, who knows, because most of them aren't reporting to the credit bureaus so it's just a matter of trying to infer what's going on. But -- so there was a big surge in supply, particularly to subprime, which is where almost all FinTechs go after. And that was alarming to us. And we felt with every month that, that supply keeps coming, as I said earlier, there's a price to be paid. \n Then you look -- then we look at the context of overlay on top of that, the -- to your question about the common mistakes, what the FinTechs almost by definition were doing because I'm not sure what else they would do, is they were leveraging technology building models in a lot of cases, but the rearview mirror that they were looking into the data set their models had were the greatest credit economy in the history of lending. \n So that's a dangerous kind of data set for the models. It was exacerbated by credit scores that had drifted dramatically more, a lot of subprime customers moving into prime just by sort of the way scoring works and what was happening as a result of the savings rates going up for consumers. \n So the -- so with FinTechs, particularly but for all the players in the business, the danger of the rearview mirror, the danger of the misreading the credit risk of customers because they were artificially, their scores would be artificially good. By the way, in our case, we pretty much just intervened in our own modeling and created a way to assume worse than the data says. We also, in our case, put heavy reliance on data and modeling from way back in the last few decades that allows us to sort of get past that. \n So that -- it's primarily the overexuberance of lenders in the environment of a combination of a great rearview mirror and frankly, a lot of extra earnings, and feeling the ability to deploy a bunch of that into marketing. \n Now what's happened since then? I think this sort of great normalization has been a very healthy thing. It would be shocking if it didn't happen. But from a health of the industry point of view, I think it's a very good thing. \n Obviously, the FinTechs -- FinTech lending has gone way. Most of it is retreated significantly. I am struck -- my earlier comment as we watch very carefully the credit card industry, I think the major players seem to be pretty rational about the credit choices they make. And now for everybody with charge-offs rising and without leveling necessarily manifesting itself, I think it's bringing back the appropriate cautions in time for a softer landing here than might otherwise have been there. \n So those are some of the thoughts that we have and those are things to keep an eye on. One other thing that I just sort of seize a moment here on things that are on our mind because I always try -- to my goal here is to always give you a window into how we're thinking and what net impression do I want folks to come away with, as we look at opportunities and a thing that's very much on our mind is the CFPB efforts on late fees. And I just want to just comment on that because that it's a very important thing that's going on. \n The CFPB late fee proposal effectively reduces late fees by approximately 75%. And the CFPB is going after the fee that we believe is the most important fee in consumer credit business. Late fees provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid becoming delinquent and damaging their credit records. And a small late fee may not have that deterrent effect. Late fees are also a way that issuers can partially price for risk, and this enables greater access -- for consumers, greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average. \n A reduction in late fees is almost certain to reduce credit access to certain parts of the population. And the CFPB proposal is, of course, not yet finalized, and it could be subject to delays or changes due to litigation. But we have to plan for the potential of this becoming law early next year. And Capital One has pursued a strategy of offering very simple credit card products with limited fees and complexity. And ironically, the late fee has been an important part of our product structure because of the reasons that I cited earlier. \n If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our revenue, gradually resolving over time. And there are ways to mitigate the impact, but as a practical matter, those solutions will take several years to work their way through the portfolio. \n So as we pull up and I share with you how we're thinking of the business, we really like the opportunities in the card marketplace we -- for all the reasons that I've talked about, but we also need to really stare at this proposal that may become the rule of the land and I just wanted to share with you how we're thinking about that. And that's an important focus of Capital One. And our solutions to that will be very focused on finding solutions that are consistent with maintaining a winning customer franchise, and that's a thing that takes time to work its way in. \n Do you have another question, Dominick, you wanted to ask?"

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.2 billion were up 7% compared to the first quarter and 16% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by tax-related outflows. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew 1% to end the quarter at 79% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. \n Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense was $2.5 billion, with $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $318 million. \n Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $318 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.6 billion as of June 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.7%, up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. \n In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $544 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 12 basis points to 7.78%. Three factors impacted the allowance in the quarter. The predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about $5 billion in the quarter. The second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of 2024 as part of our 12-month reasonable and supportable period. These 2 factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook, which still assumes a worsening from today's level. but less so than our outlook a quarter ago. \n In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $20 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio was essentially flat at 2.83%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance decreased by $218 million. In the quarter, we moved approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk. With that move, we recognized charge-offs that were already largely reflected in our allowance, which was the primary factor driving this quarter's decrease. The decrease in allowance from moving these loans to HFS was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio. We have provided additional details on our Commercial Office portfolio in the appendix of tonight's presentation. The coverage ratio in the Commercial business decreased by 20 basis points and now stands at 1.62%. \n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 150%, up from 148% last quarter and 144% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $9 billion to $118 billion, driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at $42 billion, down about $5 billion from the prior quarter. We are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter. The preliminary average quarterly NSFR for both the first and second quarters was 134%, well above the 100% regulatory minimum. \n Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.48%, 12 basis points lower than last quarter, and 6 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields. That impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter. \n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.7%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the $150 million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter. \n At the end of the second quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $7.6 billion. If we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.4%. \n During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 4.8%, resulting in a total Fed capital requirement of 9.3%. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure. So why don't I start with the deposit beta speech Ryan, since that will feed into the NIM. As we talked about last quarter and you see playing out in the marketplace at this point, there's just a number of factors that are impacting beta between product mix and the competitive dynamics on pricing, just how quickly the Fed has moved over the last 5 quarters. All of this happening under the backdrop of QT. And so we put that on top of our view for deposits all of the needs that we have, our desire to grow customer relationships and the like. And so those forces, coupled with the fact that at this point in the cycle, deposit pricing just tends to lag yields. \n And so you've seen our betas continue to rise over the last few quarters. I talked about the last cycle us being in the low 40s. And a quarter ago, I said you should expect us to kind of move up from where we were. We are now in the 52% range. I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be upward pressure on beta from here given all of the factors that I just described. \n So why don't I then start on your question about NIM with headwinds That, of course, would be one, the beta lag as well as what we're seeing in the wholesale funding market, spreads are a little bit wider. So just overall funding costs, I think, would probably be a headwind. And then we're also seeing credit continue to normalize. Rich touched in his talking points around card margin. So revenue suppression would be another headwind, all else equal. But we do see at least a few tailwinds, one being the level of revolve rate in card in the second quarter tends to be seasonally lower. And just on a longer-term basis, the current run rate has been lower over the last couple of years. So both of those factors could be driving card margin up. \n I also think that when you look at our cash position, cash is likely to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This quarter, we saw ending cash come down. Average cash was largely flat since we had built up, cash over the course of the first quarter. But I think you should expect that cash will remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic but over time, it probably will come down at least modestly from here. And then the last thing is in the back half of the year, we'll have an extra day in the quarter. So as we move into Q3, that will be a definitive tailwind. \n So those are what I would enumerate as the primary forces at play. And so one of the big ones that's going to drive the trajectory is really what ends up happening to beta. And then with respect to the allowance, Ryan, I know I've talked a lot about the mechanics in recent calls, so I'll spare all of you the tutorial. But the first thing with respect to the allowance will obviously be allowing for future growth is an obvious contributor to where the allowance goes from here. But then it's really all about the outlook for losses and in particular, what we're projecting for loss rates a year out. So Rich just described a lot of the dynamics that are at play with our outlook for [ client ] losses. So depending on how all those factors play out, that's really going to have the biggest impact, especially as you look out well into '24. Typically, Mihir, I'll take that one if you're talking just Q1 to Q2. In the first quarter, we typically have seasonal effects to compensation when bonuses are paid, payroll tax issues. You see that in the ST&B, Salary Tax and Benefit line there. So that's really the largest single factor, not necessarily a fundamental shift in any trajectory. Well, I don't think there's anything fundamentally different in the business, Mihir. I think there's a lot of question around what happens to consumer behavior when we talked about revolve rate in card and other things. And then also on the funding side, partially dependent on what the Fed ends up doing over an extended period of time where rates eventually settle out. I think those are all factors that could ultimately impact where the final resting place is for NIM, but there's nothing that is really fundamentally different across our book from where it was years ago. Yes. So the baseline assumption and our outlook focusing, I imagine you're looking mostly for unemployment rate. So we have it increasing from the 3.6% it is today to 4.3% at the end of this year and then moving higher in the 4s, but staying in the 4s through 2024. That compares to our assumption last quarter of, I believe, it was 5.1%. But remember that our models tend to use the change in unemployment rates or the rate of job creation, which we're forecasting to come down to nearly 0, rather than the level of unemployment. And so it's not just about those factors, too, in our allowance. We're also considering downside scenarios that are much more severe than that baseline. \n So when you take that into account to your first question around what are we assuming, I'm not going to give specific forecast. Rich listed out kind of the factors that we believe will create upward pressure on our loss rates in the near term, at least. And so we did assume that there's higher losses in the second quarter of next year than the quarter that we just left sort of mechanically, as I described this quarter's allowance. But where that goes from here is just so heavily assumption-laden focused on the back half of the year, I'd really focus your attention much more to delinquencies as the leading indicator to charge-offs, especially in the near term because that's where the economics ultimately are felt as opposed to the allowance that is going to move quarter-to-quarter based on assumptions looking many quarters into the future. Sure. So I think you've got it right in terms of looking at salaries and benefits in professional services in conjunction with one another as we were making substantial investments in technology we were supplementing that with some third-party resources. We brought that down as we've been able to use our brand -- our recruiting brand to bring incredible talent into the organization. And so it's really looking in some ways at those 2 lines in conjunction with one another to get a sense for the kind of underlying overall labor trend. And then in other noninterest income, no, it's -- well, not specifically a sale, one of the biggest things in that creates some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is agency income in our commercial business. So it's a little bit lumpy, but we saw some real strength in the quarter, and so that's what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase there."

In the first quarter, Capital One earned $960 million or $2.31 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4 billion were flat to the fourth quarter and up 3% relative to the fourth quarter net of adjustments. Period-end loans held for investment declined 1% and average loans were flat. Total deposits grew throughout the quarter, increasing 4% on average and 5% on an ending basis. The increase in deposits was driven by strong retail deposit inflows, which was slightly offset by a decline in our commercial deposits. Our strong retail deposit growth drove our percentage of FDIC insured deposits, up 2% to end the quarter at 78% of total deposits. \n We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower noninterest income while net interest income was largely flat. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by a decline in marketing from the seasonally higher fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up about 2% on a GAAP basis and roughly flat net of the fourth quarter adjusting items. Provision expense was $2.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.7 billion and an allowance build of $1.1 billion.\n Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1.1 billion increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.3 billion as of March 31st. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.64%, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. In our allowance, our assumptions for key economic variables remain similar to those of last quarter. We continue to assume economic worsening from today's levels on most measures. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $867 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 69 basis points to 7.66%. Our build in the quarter was primarily driven by 3 factors: the first factor is the impact of underlying growth in the quarter, which replaced seasonal balances from the fourth quarter for which we held minimal allowance.\n The second factor is the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the first quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the first quarter of 2024. Recall that our allowance methodology uses a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, before it begins to revert to our historical loss average with additional consideration of qualitative factors. \n And finally, the third factor in our allowance build was the impact of acquiring the BJ's portfolio in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $32 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio increased by 2 basis points and now stands at 2.82%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $245 million. \n The coverage ratio increased by 28 basis points and now stands at 1.82%. The allowance increase was driven by a $262 million reserve build related to our $3.6 billion commercial office portfolio. The coverage on the commercial office portfolio increased about 770 basis points and now stands at 13.9%. We have provided additional details on this portfolio on Slide 17 of the presentation.\n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 148%, up from 143% last quarter and 140% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $20 billion to $127 billion, primarily driven by increased levels of cash. Our cash position ended the quarter at $47 billion, up $16 million from the prior quarter. This increase in our cash position was primarily driven by the strong consumer deposit growth I referenced earlier.\n We expect average cash balances in the near term to be elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. In addition to the higher cash, the market value of our AFS securities portfolio grew $5 billion to $82 billion at the end of the quarter. \n Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 24 basis points lower than last quarter and 11 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The 24 basis point quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by 2 factors: first, 15 basis points of the decline was a result of having 2 fewer days in the quarter; and second, the mix impact of the elevated cash balances that I previously described pressured NIM by approximately 11 basis points. Outside of these 2 effects, higher asset yields roughly offset higher funding costs.\n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.5%, flat to the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets were offset by common and preferred dividends, the $150 million of share repurchase we completed in the quarter and a 17 basis point impact from the phase-in of the CECL transition. At the end of the first quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $6.7 billion. \n If we were to include the impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.5%, and we continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. \n Rich? \nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. \n I'll begin on Slide 10 with first quarter results in our credit card business. Year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volume drove an increase in revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the first quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 10% from the first quarter of 2022, ending loan balances increased $23 billion or about 21% year-over-year and revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 58 basis points from the prior year quarter and remains strong at 17.7%. \n Revenue margin continues to benefit from growth in the high-margin segments of our card business. In the first quarter, that benefit was more than offset by 2 factors: first, loans are currently growing at a faster rate than purchase volume and net interchange revenue. That dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. \n And second, as charge-offs increase, we're reversing more finance charge and fee revenue. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 192 basis points year-over-year to 4.04%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 3.66% and is now essentially at its March 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think the monthly charge-off rate we'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of this year. Noninterest expense was up 11% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $897 million in the first quarter. \n Our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. First quarter marketing was down about 2% from the year ago quarter and down about 20% from the fourth quarter of 2022 as the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for domestic card marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, and we're leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We are seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum and our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. \n Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, auto originations declined 47% year-over-year and 6% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased $2.2 billion or 3% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another quarter of strong retail deposit growth. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up almost $33 billion or 13% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year and up 6% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. \n Consumer Banking revenue was up 12% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.53%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.0%, up 115 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 62 basis points. The linked quarter trends were consistent with expected seasonal patterns. \n Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, first quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were down 2%. The decline is the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as higher customer paydowns in the quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 7% decline. We saw normal outflows throughout the first quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\n First quarter revenue was up 10% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the prior quarter was unusually low, driven by a company neutral move in internal funds transfer pricing. Excluding this prior quarter impact, first quarter commercial revenue would have been down 10%, driven by a decline in noninterest income from our capital markets and agency businesses. Noninterest expense was down 5% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. Criticized loan balances increased primarily in our commercial real estate business. The criticized performing loan rate increased 60 basis points from the linked quarter to 7.31% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 5 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.79%. \n In closing, once again, we delivered strong growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We continue to see opportunities for resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities, and we continue to lean into marketing. And as always, we're closely monitoring and assessing competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. In our Consumer Banking business, loans declined modestly and consumer deposits grew in the quarter. Our national digital-first consumer banking strategy continued to grow and gain traction, and we're leaning into marketing to grow our consumer deposit franchise. \n In our commercial bank, ending loans and deposits were down compared to linked quarter, reflecting our cautious stance in the commercial banking marketplace. Our commercial bank continues to focus on winning through deep industry specialization. And across our businesses, credit trends continued to normalize in the quarter, and we reached or we're approaching pre-pandemic levels at quarter end. We continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. And our balance sheet demonstrated its strength through the recent period of turmoil in the banking industry. In the first quarter, we built additional balance sheet strength as we increased allowance for credit losses, grew retail deposits and maintained or increased strong levels of capital and liquidity. \n Pulling way up, the future of everything in banking is digital. And with each passing quarter, banking is accelerating toward its inevitable destination. Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to truly transform technology and put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating and expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. We are transforming the customer experience in banking. And our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. \n Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? \nJeff Norris: [Operator Instructions] \n If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n And our first question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. \nKevin Barker: I just want to follow up on the reserve build within the card portfolio. You said it in the slide presentation worsening credit trends and domestic credit cards. But at the same time, your prepared remarks said this is more of a normalization than anything else and you continue to grow. So what gives you confidence that this reserve build and the fairly rapid increase in delinquency and net charge-offs is truly a normalization as opposed to signs of further deterioration that's likely to occur. \nRichard Fairbank: Kevin, thanks for your question there. Yes, let me just talk about this. Look, I think as we -- as things get back to where they were pre-pandemic, at some point, the word normalization, we'll need to retire that because things get pretty normal. So let's just talk just a little bit about what we're seeing and what's inherent and how we're in our outlook. \n So at this point, many of our credit metrics have returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Others have not yet, but they're headed there. And we have -- we've particularly pointed as probably the best single metric to look at is delinquencies and delinquencies in the first quarter were at 3.66%, which is essentially back to 2019 levels, excuse me. Now our charge-offs haven't caught up yet, but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of the year -- of the year, excuse me.\n And our credit metrics tend to move what I've seen just over the many years, probably a quarter or 2 ahead of the industry in both directions. We saw that in the global financial crisis, and we saw it again in the pandemic, and we're probably seeing it again here. So first of all, just relative to our outlook and how we think about in terms of forecasting our losses going forward. There is one effect that's more of a Capital One effect. It's an effect that exists for everyone. I think it's more pronounced for Capital One relative to our loss rates, which is related to recovery. So let me just pause and explain that 1 for a minute. \n Past charge-offs are, of course, the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work -- most of our recoveries we tend to work them on our own as opposed to selling them. So the recoveries come in over time and not all at once as would be the case in a debt sale. So that's just a Capital One effect that we've been talking about for a while, and that is inherent in sort of the math of how our charge-offs are working and will work over time. \n The other effect is the economy. And we are assuming material worsening of labor markets with the unemployment rate rising from today's very low levels to above 5% by the end of 2023. We are also assuming adverse effect from inflation and some further worsening of consumer profiles from the sort of the flip side of their extraordinary outperformance in the earlier period during the pandemic. So that's just a comment about how we create outlooks. We continue to feel very good about the business. We are leaning into our growth opportunities, our originations are coming in consistently solid, and we like the opportunities we see out there.\n We underwrite -- we always have underwritten for worsening scenario. So as the economy -- and sort of as credit performance normalizes, which we've expected for a long period of time, we are just continuing right on the path we have been on for quite some time. Every quarter, we trim a little bit around the edges where we see or where we anticipate an effect where customers might be a little bit more vulnerable. \n We're also struck by the continued expansion of opportunities that are very resilient, and we're leaning into those. So we -- this business is built to anticipate volatility in losses and higher loss rates. And what we're doing is consistent with things that we have expected and we continue to really feel good about the opportunities. \nKevin Barker: Okay. And then in the past, you made comments that the new growth -- the flow rates were relatively normal on a lot of your newer business. Do you continue to see that? And then also in the near term, are you still seeing the type of traction from your marketing spend, I guess, in the first quarter as you did in 2022? \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So on your question about flow rates. Let me just -- why don't I just seize the moment a little bit and just talk about a bunch of our credit metrics and where they are. So we've talked about delinquencies we've talked about losses. Our individual flow rates have normalized and if we look at very early entry flow rates and a couple of delinquency buckets. In some cases, they're just a tick higher than they were in the way back at 2019 levels, but things are basically back. \n Our payment rates have -- payment rates are a striking thing because you saw just the electrifying -- well, sorry, if you look at the trust data, the electrifying increase. The whole industry's flow rates increased pretty dramatically. Capital One's increased the most. And that was a striking effect driven really by 2 different things. One is the flip side of the -- or a manifestation of the extraordinary credit performance of the consumer where they just were in such a good position. They just were paying the card off at high levels. And it was also a manifestation of the continuing mix shift towards the top of the market and the traction we were getting in heavy spenders. \n So payment rates have declined from the very high levels. They're not even close to where they were originally. But because of these 2 effects, if we separate them out and sort of look segment by segment, we see that payment rates are declining in every segment, but not yet back to where they were pre-pandemic. So that's something to keep an eye on there. Our revolve rate is roughly flat to last year and remains below pre-pandemic levels. But I think, again, there's a growth in transacting balances effect there. So we'll have to sort of adjust for that. And then a very important one is new originations. \n Let's talk about that. So we see early performance that is consistent with our expectations, the earliest delinquencies, so we, of course, look very carefully at the early delinquencies on our most recent vintages that would be some months ago because they have to have a few months where we can start reading them. But the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of origination are consistent with pre-pandemic originations as we compare 1 segment at a time on current originations versus several years ago. \n And then vintage over vintage month over month for recent vintages, we're seeing pretty stable risk levels. So we feel very good about that. One thing that I've commented on over time is we have continued to -- in anticipation of market changes trim a little bit around the edges so that our -- the fact that our originations are performing on top of -- sort of where they were several years ago is also the result of some active anticipatory management. And so probably it offset some underlying worsening that's happened in the marketplace. \n So if we pull up on that set of metrics, we are -- we continue to feel very good about the choices we're making, as I said before, the -- this is -- puts us in a position to continue to lean into the marketing. We enter our originations, anticipate worsening as just a matter of underwriting anyway. And so we're leaning into the marketing even as we continue to trim a little bit around the edges here or there. And so in some ways, our message here is just very, very similar with the feel of how this has been for really quite a few quarters now. \nOperator: Next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck: So just want to make sure I understand on the reserve ratio. I know you already spoke a lot about it. So I just want to make sure I understand you just say yes or no. Is it fair to assume that the reserve ratio should go up every quarter where the macro stays in the current situation that we've got right now because the book that's rolling on is worse quality than the book that's rolling off. Is that fair? \nAndrew Young: I don't want to limit myself to a yes or no, Betsy, given the framing of your question. The short answer is no. And I will spare you from the allowance tutorial answer that I provided a quarter ago. But really, the mechanics are -- we have assumed for the losses or reserved for the losses that based on the current balances, that were on the books at the end of the quarter, what we assume we will experience over the next 12 months. And so if you're just replacing loan for loan with similar characteristics, you wouldn't otherwise have a build. I'm getting -- if I'm interpreting the nature of your question correctly. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then the follow-up question is just on a slightly different topic, which has to do with the expense ratio. I know you mentioned that you're looking for the operating efficiency to be flat to down this year on a year-on-year basis. I'm just wondering how to square that with what you mentioned on the marketing side where it sounds like you see a lot of opportunities in card and you are planning on leaning into the marketing side. So I just wanted to square those 2 things up. \nAndrew Young: Well, Betsy, let me just clarify, and then I'll turn it over to Rich. When our guidance for efficiency relates to operating expenses, it is not a total efficiency point. And so it would exclude whatever choices we make in marketing from that calculation. But I'll turn it to Rich to respond to the broader question. \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, I was going to say the same thing. So our guidance is with respect to operating efficiency ratio to be flat to modestly down relative to 2022. And we continue to put a lot of energy into that, of course. The total efficiency ratio includes also the marketing side of the business, as we've talked about. That's not part of our specific guidance. Our marketing choices are very dependent on the opportunity that we see, and Betsy -- you and most of the people on this call have known Capital One for a long time. And when we see opportunities, we really lean in on them. And so we can talk about marketing maybe on another question, but that's the efficiency point there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Rich, you had mentioned that you expected the card charge-offs to kind of reach 2019 levels by the middle of the year. You also talked a little bit about assuming higher unemployment over time. I guess, what's the -- what should we think about as the trajectory, I guess, in other words, which is 2019 a stopping point? Or is -- if your expected unemployment levels are reached, then we would expect to see those losses go up even higher. \nRichard Fairbank: Moshe, just with respect to unemployment rate. I want to make a comment on that. All companies, including Capital One, try to look into limited historical data. And the thing I often call trying to model on 2 humps of the camel because it's only been a small number of times in the history of the card business that various economic metrics have gone up and gone down. So limited to the camel hump point, we all do our best to try to look at the drivers of -- and the correlations with respect to credit losses. \n A striking thing all along in our journey has been the -- sort of parallel movement of unemployment rates and credit losses. So the -- it turns out from a modeling point of view, while often in the standard way people talk about things is to focus on the level of unemployment, in many of our models, actually, the rate of change is what matters most either as a measure like monthly job creation or is the change to the unemployment rate. \n So an increase in the unemployment rate from the 3s to the 5s is pretty material worsening. But that's more of a window into the -- well, we would be cautious about even though historically, card losses almost strikingly to the number of average industry card losses. They've been pretty close to the unemployment rate over those 2 humps of a camel in the past. But I think that -- I think we lean a little harder into the effects that happened when unemployment rate changes. And therefore, that just happens to be a bigger element in our own models. \n I do want to just make a couple of other points, just intuitive points about the economy. So we start with a consumer that's in a very strong place. We know that. And the consumer excess savings on average is, of course, winding down, but it's still there. But of course, credit losses play out at the margin, not just on average. But there are just a couple of effects that none of us will know until sort of after the fact one of the two, I'm going to talk about will never know, but I just want to comment on those because those affect our outlook of where credit losses can be.\n One, of course, is inflation. And none of us really have historical data in the card business to understand or predict the effects of significant increases and levels of inflation, but we are expecting inflation to impact consumer credit by compressing real incomes and as kind of a separate effect from an unemployment effect. And we -- since we haven't seen sustained inflation for more than 40 years, we can't really model this effect directly, but we make informed assumptions in our outlook to sort of account for this effect. So for example, a way to think about this is if there is a decline in real income that happens with this, we can look at our history and our cross-sectional evaluation of how people do as a function of different income levels, and then we can sort of extrapolate from those credit effects and proxy how something like inflation can have an effect there.\n So it's sort of using proxies, but it matches off to an intuitive assumption that high levels of inflation are going to be challenging for people. And finally, the other effect is, as I intuitively think about the marketplace, over all the years of sort of my journey in this, we've tended to see that periods of abnormally good credit are followed by periods of worse credit and vice versa. And the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented.\n So there's -- what maybe we could call a catching-up effect that happens on the other side of that for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. And sort of the reverse of this effect happened in the global financial crisis, where charge-offs were accelerated and then it was kind of followed by a period of strikingly benign credit. This is an effect, I intuitively believe, we can't measure it. We won't even in hindsight, be able to measure it, but I just think it's part of the intuition that we bring into the business. \n So when we pull kind of way up on things, we share with you the credit metrics that we see. And pretty much what you see is all that we see. So now we're all in the business of saying, where does this go from here? I shared with you some intuitive views that would lead to higher charge-off levels over time. And when we look at those, when we look at our card how we underwrite in card, we both can believe effects like this or -- will happen over time and also how strong the opportunity in card continues to be. \n So that's just a little window into how we think about that. And then that's sort of me talking, but then, of course, Andrew leads the whole process relative to -- and our Head of Credit, the whole process relative to the allowance build. But anyway, those are some thoughts about credit and how the kind of factors that may play out over time. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Maybe just switching gears a little bit. You mentioned the capital ratio and then the capital ratio if the AOCI were excluded or included. When you think about capital return over the next year, which one of those are you using as your base? \nAndrew Young: Yes, Moshe, it's Andrew. We look at a number of things as we are considering our capital actions. And so I've been saying for a couple of quarters now, we've seen an increased level of uncertainty in the economic environment, wide ranges around growth opportunities and everything that's happened over the last 1.5 months has increased that level of uncertainty. And so we continue to believe that it's prudent to operate above our 11% long-term target, both until we have more clarity, both not only on the economic front, but to the potential regulatory changes that may be coming down the pike, which could very well include treatment of AOCI in capital. \n But of course, we don't know that yet. And so for now, we're continuing to operate above that long-term target. But suffice it to say, we have substantial capital generation capacity, and we regularly evaluate our plans in light of the economic changes in light of regulatory changes, we have the ability to pivot quickly in our deployment and certainly we'll do so when we feel like the time is right. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Shane with JPMorgan. \nRichard Shane: Andrew, I'd like to talk a little bit about the impact of the surge in deposits. When we look at the impact, it appears that it primarily runs through the corporate and other line in terms of where the NIM impact is. But the other change that I think we see is that it looks like the transfer pricing on deposits went down modestly. When we think about things going forward, should we assume that there's a continued drag at the corporate line from the elevated deposits and that because the reinvestment rate is lower, that the transfer pricing is going to be a little bit lower as well. \nAndrew Young: Well, Rick, let me just clarify first. And I'm assuming you're just looking at the net interest income trends in other, which does serve as a clearing house for FTPs, but happy to talk to you offline in more detail about this. But the basic tenets of the FTP process or there's an arm's length transaction between corporate and other and deposits. And so they're getting a prevailing rate, which shows up in the revenue of either the Consumer Banking segment or the commercial banking segment. And so there isn't a subsidy or drag going on there. There's just a number of other clearing factors that happen in other. \nRichard Shane: Understood. But actually, we've figured out a way over the years to calculate the NII on the transferred deposits through the consumer bank and it looks like they were down, and it's been very accurate over a long time. It looks like the transfer deposit rate was down about 8 basis points -- so at the consumer bank. So I'm curious, it looks like there was a drag in terms of corporate and other and actually the benefit of the bank was a little bit less attractive from an NII perspective as well. \nJeff Norris: Rick, it's Jeff. I don't think we can comment on a calculation that you're doing that we don't fully understand. Why don't you and I take that offline? \nRichard Shane: Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. \nArren Cyganovich: Maybe talk a little bit about credit card purchase volumes look like they inched up a little bit during the quarter. We've heard that from others that they're seeing slowdown in purchase volume in March and into April. What are you seeing within your portfolio? And are there kind of any differences between different income demographics that you're seeing within your customers? \nRichard Fairbank: So Aaron, yes. Let's just talk about purchase volume. So -- in Q1, our card purchase volume was up 10% year-over-year. And this grows while it's very solid, has decreased from the first part of 2022. But I think it's striking to separate out spend per active account and then like the growth of accounts and some of the benefits of our recent origination efforts. So if we look at spend per active account, now it was sort of -- it just really surge from the doldrums of the deep pandemic, then it really surged into the levels it was a year ago. \n We see spend per active account is pretty flat to a year ago. And it is -- and we can watch it on a typically, over the last few months, it has been sort of declining on that coming down to basically a sort of net result of being flat for a year ago or I think maybe it's actually in the last couple of months a little bit under where it was a year ago, if I remember the graph that I was looking at. \n Now initially, it's a funny thing how so often we see effects that start on the lower income, lower credit score side and then make their way up. I mean, pretty much the whole way credit has played out both on the improving side in the pandemic and then on the normalizing side, that's happened. But on spend, this slowing down happened in lower income segments first, but now it's more broad-based across income bands and really segments of our card business. So we, of course, are having very nice growth in accounts, and that's continuing to power purchase volume even as the spend sort of levels out. \n Now in the spirit of what are we rooting for, it seems to me to be a pretty rational thing for consumers to sort of level off this pretty strong spend that they have had. So I think what we see, we're pretty pleased with -- and then when we look at things like discretionary and nondiscretionary spending, both of them have slowed significantly over the last year. Well -- no, the growth rates have slowed significantly, but the category mix of spend, the more things change, the more they stay the same because basically pretty much across all the categories, things have returned to the pre-pandemic level. \nArren Cyganovich: And just following up. I appreciate the commercial office disclosures you put in your slide deck. It looks relatively small comparative to the overall commercial and overall loan portfolio total together. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about your commercial real estate business. Is this -- I know you acquired several kind of smaller banks, North Fork and Hibernia and Chevy Chase. Are these predominantly portfolios from around those regions? Or do you also have a national lending business that deals in larger commercial real estate as well? \nAndrew Young: Yes. Let me start by talking about kind of what isn't in the disclosure that we provided because I know there's differences across various organizations. I mean as you know, Arren, that it's a little less than $4 billion and represents about 1% of our total loans, but this is our commercial office space. It is excluding, as you probably saw in the footnote, medical office and REIT and REIF medical office just has very different characteristics and so 2 does that's REIT and REIF. \n So in terms of the commercial office portfolio on our books, it's roughly 2/3 concentrated in New York, D.C. and San Francisco. It is roughly 60% B, C and obviously, 40% Class A. And so it has been accumulated over time, but it also was a business that up until a few years ago, we were active in, but we haven't had any new originations for the past few quarters and reduced our exposure to this segment over the past year by a little north of I think it's 10%. But given right now just the uncertainty that we see with office vacancies being elevated and utilization rates significantly below pre-pandemic levels and increasing debt service burdens despite the fact that we are getting 100% payment on principal and interest just in light of the continued uncertainty that I described just in terms of utilization and other factors. We decided to increase the coverage ratio quite a bit this quarter, and that's what you see in the disclosure in the back. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: Maybe I know there's been a lot of questions on credit, but maybe just to follow up on another one, Rich. So can you maybe just talk about where the credit performance was worse or where it deteriorated. And also I'm surprised by the comment that you're reaching normal levels despite continued elevated payment rates and lower revolve rate. So how do you think about from here balancing growth versus the risk of credit continuing to not only normalize but get worse? \nRichard Fairbank: So yes, Ryan, I think the best net impression despite the fact that when we look at all our credit metrics, the -- some of them, like half of them aren't sort of back to pre-pandemic levels, and half of them are. My gut feel is it's a better net impression to view them as back. And I just think the underlying effects of continuing to lean into spenders, not only at the very top of the market, but within our segments and just the emphasis that we put on spend and some of the products, the marketing, the way we manage accounts, the kind of -- the people we raise lines to, et cetera. I just think there's been a subtle shift a little more towards the spending side. So I think that might explain why a few of these metrics are behind, but behind in terms of the -- but I think I walk around with the perception that things are pretty much at the levels of where they were a few years ago.\n So now we feel very comfortable with respect to the choices that we're making, and let's just talk about why that is. I've already said, we underwrite to assumed worsening. So let's go back to back when the behavior of the consumer was at levels we've never seen in the whole history of the company. The credit performance was so good. We just assumed that was unsustainable. We underwrote to much higher levels of losses. So as things normalize, that's not really sort of changing anything at Capital One. So we -- but at the same time, you see the noise all over the place on the horizon. So we obsessively look for -- we not only use all of our modern and machine learning-based monitoring tools to identify little pockets that might be gapping out from expected performance or prior performance or anything like that.\n And by the way, we have seen that in some pockets and then we dialed that back. We also hunt around and think about where would most intuitively the vulnerabilities be to where the economy is going. And we even anticipatorily kind of dial back around the edges there. But as I said earlier, I'm kind of struck by the number of new opportunities that are originating in terms of driven by the tech transformation of the company, new channels, new ways to succeed with customers that for kind of -- for every dial back that's happened, we seem to have had opportunities open up, and so we lean into those. \n And so it leads to my sitting in here and saying with respect to the card business, we feel, and I want you to walk away with that same net impression, the same level of optimism about our growth opportunities and our marketing and really the opportunity to create value in this part of the -- where we are in the cycle with card to be very strong. Now even as that happens, just to -- it's always striking to talk about the fact that the sibling of the card business, which is our auto business has been in a striking pullback mode over the very same period that we've been leaning in here and I partly point that out just to say that we don't at the top of the house, say there's just a green light out there.\n This is all very much one part of the business at a time, 1 segment, 1 business area, but that pullback in auto has been a minority of the pullback, but still an important part of the pullback has been credit driven in the sense of looking at things in the card business and trying to get ahead of any effects that we think might happen from a credit point of view, but the majority of the effects have been margin related, as we've talked about with the some of the marketplace not passing through into their pricing, the higher interest rates. And so the -- and so we have dialed back quite a bit in auto. But given that most of that dial back or certainly the majority of it is really more margin related and not so much credit related. We -- if things change and normalize a little bit more on the pricing side, we might be able to open up more opportunity in auto. \n But what I'm pleased about is the combination of the -- walking around with an intuitive model about how the marketplace works. And as I shared in the earlier answer, thinking about the ways customers -- credit can worsen and customers can do perform not as well as it might appear as we obsess about that, that informs our choices and then by monitoring at the margin and incredibly granularly to look for effects and then having the technology to move so quickly with respect to the identification, the diagnosis of what's going on, the root causes of it and then taking the action, which is a cycle that's way faster than it used to be before our tech transformation. \n All of these contribute to the ability to be able to move with confidence in a changing environment and probably has contributed to why the vintage curves sort of keep coming back -- coming in on top of each other despite a changing environment. And all of that finally leads to why we feel confident about our opportunities to lean into growth because every opportunity has a limited window, and we're the company that when we see those opportunities, we go after them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. \nBill Carcache: As a follow-up for you, Andrew, on your allowance commentary, just to make sure I have the mechanics right. If macro conditions do indeed worsen from here as you expect? And each new quarter, that comes on reflects the worse outlook than each old quarter that rolls off. Is it reasonable to expect that your reserve rate would drift higher in future quarters given that dynamic? \nAndrew Young: It would, Bill. I was responding to what I interpreted to be Betsy's question of just individual vintages being the same, similar to what Rich just described. That in and of itself if you have a consistent growth rate wouldn't add to allowance. But if we're updating our assumptions a quarter from now and our economic view changes that will likely change our estimation of the loss content of the portfolio at that time. \nBill Carcache: Understood. That's super helpful. And then separately, Rich, I wanted to ask you about the CFPB [ lengthy ] proposal. We know it's less significant for you than it is for others who are more deeply involved in the partnership business. But as we try to think through how this may play out across the industry, can you give any perspective on the extent to which you'd expect some merchants to possibly push back against efforts by their issuing partners to renegotiate economic terms following the proposed reduction in late fees, particularly in cases where merchants expect their sales to come under pressure? \nRichard Fairbank: So Bill, I don't really -- I don't really have a -- I don't have a prediction about what exactly happens in the partnership business relative to merchant -- partnership agreements and then something as significant as the change in late fees comes and therefore, what do the collective -- the merchant and the issuer sort of do about that, I don't really have a prediction on that one. I just -- I wouldn't want to let your opening comment go just when you say, well, it's obviously much more probably for the people with partnerships than others because this -- where this legislation to come into effect, it has a significant impact on Capital One. So now there's a lot of miles to go before maybe everything works out. But just to comment on this for a second. \n First of all, with respect to the proposal, it's not final, and we -- the CFPBs will get lots of public comments. And we'll have to see how the rule-making process plays out. Late fees play in a very important role in the system because they provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid running into delinquency. And it's also a way that issuers can sort of price for risk, and all this leads to greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average.\n So we certainly have a point of view on this one. A change in -- a significant change in late fees could affect consumer payment behavior and delinquencies, it could affect access to certain parts of the population. So there's kind of a lot at stake. But what I wanted to say for Capital One, this is -- it's an important revenue source for Capital One. And we obviously are working on thinking about those impacts, what might be mitigating measures. And so we're early into our thinking about it, but I think not only for partnership-based companies. But for Capital One and maybe some other players as well, this is an important development that we're going to all have to take very seriously. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. \nJohn Hecht: Actually, all my questions have been asked and answered, but something came up to me and Rich, I apologize, it's somewhat nebulous. But in the past, you've given us some good metaphors to think about the environment. I think during the pandemic and stimulus zone, you talked about it, you're boring through a mountain because of stimulus, which helped avoid some level of loss content. We're in this unique world where we have inflation. Many of us haven't really lived or at least analyzed the equity markets in a period like this.\n And then we've got a lot of other factors going on as well, both good and bad. I'm wondering whether it's a metaphor or not, you -- with stepping back, how do you describe the overall environment? You're advancing in certain categories, pulling back and others. Is there some context you can give us or a comparison to a previous time or how you think about it in comparison to previous times? \nRichard Fairbank: Well, thank you, John. I'd forgotten all about. I know you've been around me for quite a while. I love metaphors, and sometimes metaphors, I think, can be pretty striking ways to think about things that otherwise are complex to talk about. But going back to the boring through the mountain. Remember, we were talking back then each quarter, we'd say, well, we're in -- what could be very whopping losses that come from the tremendous upheaval of the pandemic every quarter, we are boring through the mountain and with the government stimulus and so on. \n If we think back, we got all the way through the mountain to the other side. And it was better from a credit point of view than anything that we can kind of imagine. So if I pull up and just say, where am I just -- how do I feel about where we are. When I think about the health of the consumer, the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in an uncertain economy. \n The savings accumulated over the pandemic remain a positive for many consumers, that servicing burdens remain low by historical standards. The labor market, which is usually the most important economic driver of consumer credit performance remains strikingly strong, although we have seen some indications of some softening. \n Now you -- on the other hand, home prices have been falling a little bit. Inflation, I really believe none of us know really the effects of inflation, so we're going to be needing to manage intuitively here. We can't pull out PhDs to figure this one out. But -- so we assume the inflation is going to -- here's an interesting thought on inflation versus unemployment, John. \n Unemployment affects a small number of people terribly. Inflation affects all of us somewhat. And so from a credit point of view, I believe the reason unemployment has been the biggest driver is that because charge-offs happen at the tail of the distribution and the tail moves when the economy moves, so what is the effect of all of us losing a little bit of our purchasing power. My gut feel is it's just something that is slow in its effect. It's cumulative. It doesn't have the sort of precipitous effects that the unemployment does. But I still believe on little cat feet, there's another metaphor for you, John. \n I think it will play out. The other one, and it's almost -- I want to go back. I don't have a perfect metaphor for it, but I do want to say, again, I -- I've been around this business long enough to kind of know that extreme effects with respect to credit for a period of time, create the opposite effect on the other side, just -- it does with respect to markets and competition, but that's not even what I'm talking about here. I just -- I believe in life, let's just say there's always a certain percentage of consumers that are living on the edge, they're vulnerable and they don't have much of a buffer to absorb shock. \n So then when the global financial crisis came along, it was like a tsunami wave coming in and everyone who was -- I feel just so many people that were in a somewhat vulnerable situation got sort of washed over from that, that it was followed by this period where we had trouble keeping up with our own forecast of the losses. We -- in a good way in the sense that we finally said, this is the survivorship effect. The Great Recession accelerated so many charge-offs that at some point were statistically probably going to happen that we had a survivorship effect going on that anybody can survive that probably not charging off anytime soon, and that's why you sort of had there for the reverse of that effect.\n And I believe intuitively, I have no way to prove it and we'll never be able to quantify it, but just intuitively thinking about it when there were still vulnerable people all during the period of the pandemic, so many of them got lifelines that I think you can -- it doesn't mean there are lives necessarily changed. And I think you have sort of the reverse survivorship effect or maybe the sort of the catching-up effect from very, very low losses. And this is something that I believe is a real effect. And so if I pull up, I think the consumer is in a great shape. You're going to have sort of on little cat feet, the inflation effect and the catching-up effect and then you have a wildcard of a quite uncertain economy that creates greater volatility than usual in terms of where things might go. \n But in the context of all of that, and the opportunities we see -- one of the things -- sorry, it's a long answer to your question. But one of the things that you may remember my saying back when the credit was just unsustainably good a couple of years ago. I remember saying that there will be real consequences in the competitive marketplace if this abnormal environment continues for too low. And we really already saw it happen in the period of the extraordinary credit. What you saw is a tremendous inflow of FinTechs, you saw a huge expansion of credit, primarily in the subprime and even below sort of where we play in that space. \n We were worried that the underwriting that any of them were doing would be -- it's based on data, would definitionally not have a rear view, it would have a rearview mirror that is extremely unreliable. So I think when I would pull back this sort of great normalization that's happening even with some cat feet effects that are still probably going to play out is a very healthy thing to happen in terms of credit environment, competitive environments in the marketplace over time. So all in all, I feel really good about where we are. And if you detect optimism in my voice, you're getting the right read there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. \nDominick Gabriele: Almost to piggyback on that last question a little bit. There have been a lot of new card issuers and types of cards and payment types like P2P, debit rewards, FedNow is coming out. Could you talk about the evolving of both debit and credit card space? And how you expect the competition and offerings could change over time, not just versus, let's say, Discover Synchrony or American Express, but other payment types and how Capital One is positioned as payment preferences among consumers might change. \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, the -- we've seen a lot of innovation over the last number of years. I'd add one to your list, one that really was quite a made quite a flash, which is buy-now pay-later that came into the marketplace. \n Let me really sort of start with that one. With buy-now pay-later came out, I remember having sort of saying this is kind of ironic because the original and still extraordinary buy-now pay-later product is called the credit card. So what is this new one that says, you can buy-now and pay-later. But anyway, it was riding on the back of some very, very clever technology sort of modern tech stacks and really good merchant relationships that made quite an impact on there. Now it was hailed as a revolution in payments from everything that we saw early on. I think it was, by the way, a very clever payment -- a very clever innovation, but it turned out to be more of a credit access play than necessarily. I'm not saying it isn't a revolution.\n Well, I'm saying that when we look at who flop there, it was a credit from looking at our bank customers and card customers, everything else, it was a credit access play and I think it's running into some challenges with respect to merchant discount rates and some credit challenges and other things, but it was certainly quite innovation. If you look at debit cards, anyone innovating in the debit card space that has access to the differential interchange that came from the law that created, tried to advantage smaller players versus bigger and networks other than -- well, different choices for different networks and different sized players. \n Anyone who has the fortune to ride on the back of that. I think that's a promising opportunity for them. And so payments -- the payment space will continue to evolve. One other thing about payments that when you look pull way up and say in what areas have FinTechs or major tech companies have the biggest impact on banking. It was -- we, of course, worried that all aspects of banking would get affected. But the biggest -- I think the biggest single area that has really been impacted is payments itself which -- when you think about it, that it's kind of the holy grail from a tech company's point of view because it's where the money is, and it's a real-time kind of customer experience activity. \n And importantly, it's not heavily regulated. For what it's worth the other play that I think the tech companies enduringly have had the greatest impact is in the platforms space, either payments platforms or other kind of platforms, building on modern tech stack. So those are some thoughts in the marketplace. But -- so just a reminder, Capital One has got to stay on the forefront of innovation or we can be yesterday's news. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I've got some follow-up questions for Andrew and some of the comments. Maybe just first on the 11 basis points drag from the excess cash. Does that persist over the course of the year? Or does that go away at some point? \nAndrew Young: Well, as I said in my talking points, Sanjay, I think that is something that we do expect to remain at least elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. So yes, I would -- that's probably where I would leave that. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then secondly, just the comments on capital levels and capital return. Should we assume like you're going to maintain CET1 inclusive of sort of AOCI or work your way up to that level and then consider any moves with capital return? Or maybe you can just help us think through how we should read into some of your comments there. And then -- at what rate does AOCI accrete over the course of the year? Just would love to get some color on that. \nAndrew Young: Yes. Why don't I start with the second one first, which is -- if you look at our AFS AOCI, about 40% of that will pull to par between now and the end of '24. In terms of capital targets, I absolutely would not say it's a mechanical linkage that we are thinking about our capital targets inclusive of AOCI. There's a lot of uncertainty of regulatory treatment. It is not included in our regulatory ratios at this point. I just referenced that, that is one thing that we look at in addition to a number of other factors inclusive of just economic uncertainty and our growth opportunities. And so for now, we've been operating above our target. We're going to keep an eye on those things. And as we have more certainty of the future, we have a lot of flexibility with how we return capital to shareholders, if that's appropriate. \nOperator: Our final question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. \nJohn Pancari: On the net interest margin front, I wanted to see if you could possibly give us some color on how you see the margin trajectory here from the 660 level just given what you said about cash balances likely to remain elevated? And then maybe how deposit pricing plays into that and how you're thinking about through cycle deposit beta at this point. \nAndrew Young: Well, I'll go in reverse order on that one, too, because the beta will feed into the NIM response there. I'll remind you of my comments from a quarter ago, where I talked about cumulative deposit beta for the overall company could be somewhat higher than the last rate cycle, which was 41%. \n I think a quarter ago, our cumulative beta was in the mid-30s, where we sit today, it's 44. It is hard to predict how much further deposit betas will increase from here. There's a number of unique factors, especially following the events of the last month that makes predicting betas a challenge. Everything from product mix to the market in competitive pricing, if there's really intense competition from more insured deposits and just the sheer magnitude and pace of Fed fund hikes is unprecedented and what happens to on the other side when the Fed eventually starts lowering rates, and all of this is happening in the context of a Fed that's executing QT. \n So where we go from here is going to be impacted by a number of factors, customers' appetite for different deposit products, our focus on customer relationships, industry competition, funding needs. But I will say, given deposit pricing tends to lag asset yield resets. I wouldn't be surprised if there's at least some upward pressure on beta from where we were in the first quarter. So as I then pull that into thinking about NIM over time, that is likely a potential headwind for us, particularly in the near term given the lag of deposit pricing, where wholesale funding costs go could also be a headwind. And as credit continues to normalize, we could continue to see revenue suppression.\n So those are a few things that will potentially provide a headwind to NIM from where we sit today. But on the other hand, there's definitely some tailwinds even though my response to Sanjay's question in the real near term, I would think our average cash position will stay elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, not necessarily relative to what we saw in the first quarter. But over a longer period of time, that will almost assuredly come back down and eventually be a tailwind for NIM. We also could see a growing percentage of revolving card balances and in the immediate term, keep in mind, we'll have one more day in the second quarter.\n So I know that that's a lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but just wanted to give you a sense of all of the forces that play there. \nJohn Pancari: That's very helpful. And then just secondly, we've seen some headlines regarding the Walmart partnership. And I don't know if you can provide a little bit of color there and where that stands, maybe can you confirm the discussions, the timing of when any change could be? And then lastly, if you can update us on any other upcoming negotiations or maturities of other types of partnerships on that front? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thank you, John. So -- we are, of course, in the middle of litigation. So there's only so much -- I'm going to share in an earnings call about the various legal arguments being made by each side. But at a high level, Walmart has sued us trying to terminate the deal early, and we deny that they have a contractual right to an early termination. Walmart points to some service failures that we cured in 2022 and which had no impact on the value of the portfolio. Now in the meantime, we are committed to meeting our contractual commitments while we defend ourselves in court. And we will keep you updated on the litigation in our periodic SEC filings.\n With respect to timing of any potential impacts there are a lot of unknowns. There's the -- of course, the question of whether Walmart will win their litigation seeking early termination. And if so, when that will occur. We, of course, deny that they have a right to terminate early. Then there's a question of how long it will take for Walmart to transfer the portfolio to a new issue. We currently expect that the transfer of the Walmart portfolio to a new issuer would occur no earlier than January 2025, even if they win their litigation. So we will keep you updated if our timing expectation changes. \nJeff Norris: Well, that concludes the earnings call for this evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call, and thank you for your interest in Capital One. The IR team will be here later this evening to answer any questions that may remain. Have a good night, everybody. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Fairbank",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. \n I'll begin on Slide 10 with first quarter results in our credit card business. Year-over-year growth in loans and purchase volume drove an increase in revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the first quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the first quarter was up 10% from the first quarter of 2022, ending loan balances increased $23 billion or about 21% year-over-year and revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 58 basis points from the prior year quarter and remains strong at 17.7%. \n Revenue margin continues to benefit from growth in the high-margin segments of our card business. In the first quarter, that benefit was more than offset by 2 factors: first, loans are currently growing at a faster rate than purchase volume and net interchange revenue. That dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. \n And second, as charge-offs increase, we're reversing more finance charge and fee revenue. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 192 basis points year-over-year to 4.04%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 134 basis points from the prior year to 3.66% and is now essentially at its March 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think the monthly charge-off rate we'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of this year. Noninterest expense was up 11% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was $897 million in the first quarter. \n Our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing. First quarter marketing was down about 2% from the year ago quarter and down about 20% from the fourth quarter of 2022 as the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for domestic card marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, and we're leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We are seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum and our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. \n Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, auto originations declined 47% year-over-year and 6% from the linked quarter. Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased $2.2 billion or 3% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. We posted another quarter of strong retail deposit growth. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up almost $33 billion or 13% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year and up 6% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. \n Consumer Banking revenue was up 12% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.53%, up 87 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.0%, up 115 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 62 basis points. The linked quarter trends were consistent with expected seasonal patterns. \n Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, first quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were down 2%. The decline is the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as higher customer paydowns in the quarter. Ending deposits were down 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 7% decline. We saw normal outflows throughout the first quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.\n First quarter revenue was up 10% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the prior quarter was unusually low, driven by a company neutral move in internal funds transfer pricing. Excluding this prior quarter impact, first quarter commercial revenue would have been down 10%, driven by a decline in noninterest income from our capital markets and agency businesses. Noninterest expense was down 5% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. Criticized loan balances increased primarily in our commercial real estate business. The criticized performing loan rate increased 60 basis points from the linked quarter to 7.31% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 5 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.79%. \n In closing, once again, we delivered strong growth in domestic card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the first quarter. We continue to see opportunities for resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities, and we continue to lean into marketing. And as always, we're closely monitoring and assessing competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. In our Consumer Banking business, loans declined modestly and consumer deposits grew in the quarter. Our national digital-first consumer banking strategy continued to grow and gain traction, and we're leaning into marketing to grow our consumer deposit franchise. \n In our commercial bank, ending loans and deposits were down compared to linked quarter, reflecting our cautious stance in the commercial banking marketplace. Our commercial bank continues to focus on winning through deep industry specialization. And across our businesses, credit trends continued to normalize in the quarter, and we reached or we're approaching pre-pandemic levels at quarter end. We continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. And our balance sheet demonstrated its strength through the recent period of turmoil in the banking industry. In the first quarter, we built additional balance sheet strength as we increased allowance for credit losses, grew retail deposits and maintained or increased strong levels of capital and liquidity. \n Pulling way up, the future of everything in banking is digital. And with each passing quarter, banking is accelerating toward its inevitable destination. Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to truly transform technology and put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating and expanding set of opportunities across our businesses. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale. We are transforming the customer experience in banking. And our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. \n Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Kevin, thanks for your question there. Yes, let me just talk about this. Look, I think as we -- as things get back to where they were pre-pandemic, at some point, the word normalization, we'll need to retire that because things get pretty normal. So let's just talk just a little bit about what we're seeing and what's inherent and how we're in our outlook. \n So at this point, many of our credit metrics have returned to their pre-pandemic levels. Others have not yet, but they're headed there. And we have -- we've particularly pointed as probably the best single metric to look at is delinquencies and delinquencies in the first quarter were at 3.66%, which is essentially back to 2019 levels, excuse me. Now our charge-offs haven't caught up yet, but based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back to 2019 levels around the middle of the year -- of the year, excuse me.\n And our credit metrics tend to move what I've seen just over the many years, probably a quarter or 2 ahead of the industry in both directions. We saw that in the global financial crisis, and we saw it again in the pandemic, and we're probably seeing it again here. So first of all, just relative to our outlook and how we think about in terms of forecasting our losses going forward. There is one effect that's more of a Capital One effect. It's an effect that exists for everyone. I think it's more pronounced for Capital One relative to our loss rates, which is related to recovery. So let me just pause and explain that 1 for a minute. \n Past charge-offs are, of course, the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work -- most of our recoveries we tend to work them on our own as opposed to selling them. So the recoveries come in over time and not all at once as would be the case in a debt sale. So that's just a Capital One effect that we've been talking about for a while, and that is inherent in sort of the math of how our charge-offs are working and will work over time. \n The other effect is the economy. And we are assuming material worsening of labor markets with the unemployment rate rising from today's very low levels to above 5% by the end of 2023. We are also assuming adverse effect from inflation and some further worsening of consumer profiles from the sort of the flip side of their extraordinary outperformance in the earlier period during the pandemic. So that's just a comment about how we create outlooks. We continue to feel very good about the business. We are leaning into our growth opportunities, our originations are coming in consistently solid, and we like the opportunities we see out there.\n We underwrite -- we always have underwritten for worsening scenario. So as the economy -- and sort of as credit performance normalizes, which we've expected for a long period of time, we are just continuing right on the path we have been on for quite some time. Every quarter, we trim a little bit around the edges where we see or where we anticipate an effect where customers might be a little bit more vulnerable. \n We're also struck by the continued expansion of opportunities that are very resilient, and we're leaning into those. So we -- this business is built to anticipate volatility in losses and higher loss rates. And what we're doing is consistent with things that we have expected and we continue to really feel good about the opportunities. Yes. So on your question about flow rates. Let me just -- why don't I just seize the moment a little bit and just talk about a bunch of our credit metrics and where they are. So we've talked about delinquencies we've talked about losses. Our individual flow rates have normalized and if we look at very early entry flow rates and a couple of delinquency buckets. In some cases, they're just a tick higher than they were in the way back at 2019 levels, but things are basically back. \n Our payment rates have -- payment rates are a striking thing because you saw just the electrifying -- well, sorry, if you look at the trust data, the electrifying increase. The whole industry's flow rates increased pretty dramatically. Capital One's increased the most. And that was a striking effect driven really by 2 different things. One is the flip side of the -- or a manifestation of the extraordinary credit performance of the consumer where they just were in such a good position. They just were paying the card off at high levels. And it was also a manifestation of the continuing mix shift towards the top of the market and the traction we were getting in heavy spenders. \n So payment rates have declined from the very high levels. They're not even close to where they were originally. But because of these 2 effects, if we separate them out and sort of look segment by segment, we see that payment rates are declining in every segment, but not yet back to where they were pre-pandemic. So that's something to keep an eye on there. Our revolve rate is roughly flat to last year and remains below pre-pandemic levels. But I think, again, there's a growth in transacting balances effect there. So we'll have to sort of adjust for that. And then a very important one is new originations. \n Let's talk about that. So we see early performance that is consistent with our expectations, the earliest delinquencies, so we, of course, look very carefully at the early delinquencies on our most recent vintages that would be some months ago because they have to have a few months where we can start reading them. But the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of origination are consistent with pre-pandemic originations as we compare 1 segment at a time on current originations versus several years ago. \n And then vintage over vintage month over month for recent vintages, we're seeing pretty stable risk levels. So we feel very good about that. One thing that I've commented on over time is we have continued to -- in anticipation of market changes trim a little bit around the edges so that our -- the fact that our originations are performing on top of -- sort of where they were several years ago is also the result of some active anticipatory management. And so probably it offset some underlying worsening that's happened in the marketplace. \n So if we pull up on that set of metrics, we are -- we continue to feel very good about the choices we're making, as I said before, the -- this is -- puts us in a position to continue to lean into the marketing. We enter our originations, anticipate worsening as just a matter of underwriting anyway. And so we're leaning into the marketing even as we continue to trim a little bit around the edges here or there. And so in some ways, our message here is just very, very similar with the feel of how this has been for really quite a few quarters now. Yes. Well, I was going to say the same thing. So our guidance is with respect to operating efficiency ratio to be flat to modestly down relative to 2022. And we continue to put a lot of energy into that, of course. The total efficiency ratio includes also the marketing side of the business, as we've talked about. That's not part of our specific guidance. Our marketing choices are very dependent on the opportunity that we see, and Betsy -- you and most of the people on this call have known Capital One for a long time. And when we see opportunities, we really lean in on them. And so we can talk about marketing maybe on another question, but that's the efficiency point there. Moshe, just with respect to unemployment rate. I want to make a comment on that. All companies, including Capital One, try to look into limited historical data. And the thing I often call trying to model on 2 humps of the camel because it's only been a small number of times in the history of the card business that various economic metrics have gone up and gone down. So limited to the camel hump point, we all do our best to try to look at the drivers of -- and the correlations with respect to credit losses. \n A striking thing all along in our journey has been the -- sort of parallel movement of unemployment rates and credit losses. So the -- it turns out from a modeling point of view, while often in the standard way people talk about things is to focus on the level of unemployment, in many of our models, actually, the rate of change is what matters most either as a measure like monthly job creation or is the change to the unemployment rate. \n So an increase in the unemployment rate from the 3s to the 5s is pretty material worsening. But that's more of a window into the -- well, we would be cautious about even though historically, card losses almost strikingly to the number of average industry card losses. They've been pretty close to the unemployment rate over those 2 humps of a camel in the past. But I think that -- I think we lean a little harder into the effects that happened when unemployment rate changes. And therefore, that just happens to be a bigger element in our own models. \n I do want to just make a couple of other points, just intuitive points about the economy. So we start with a consumer that's in a very strong place. We know that. And the consumer excess savings on average is, of course, winding down, but it's still there. But of course, credit losses play out at the margin, not just on average. But there are just a couple of effects that none of us will know until sort of after the fact one of the two, I'm going to talk about will never know, but I just want to comment on those because those affect our outlook of where credit losses can be.\n One, of course, is inflation. And none of us really have historical data in the card business to understand or predict the effects of significant increases and levels of inflation, but we are expecting inflation to impact consumer credit by compressing real incomes and as kind of a separate effect from an unemployment effect. And we -- since we haven't seen sustained inflation for more than 40 years, we can't really model this effect directly, but we make informed assumptions in our outlook to sort of account for this effect. So for example, a way to think about this is if there is a decline in real income that happens with this, we can look at our history and our cross-sectional evaluation of how people do as a function of different income levels, and then we can sort of extrapolate from those credit effects and proxy how something like inflation can have an effect there.\n So it's sort of using proxies, but it matches off to an intuitive assumption that high levels of inflation are going to be challenging for people. And finally, the other effect is, as I intuitively think about the marketplace, over all the years of sort of my journey in this, we've tended to see that periods of abnormally good credit are followed by periods of worse credit and vice versa. And the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented.\n So there's -- what maybe we could call a catching-up effect that happens on the other side of that for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. And sort of the reverse of this effect happened in the global financial crisis, where charge-offs were accelerated and then it was kind of followed by a period of strikingly benign credit. This is an effect, I intuitively believe, we can't measure it. We won't even in hindsight, be able to measure it, but I just think it's part of the intuition that we bring into the business. \n So when we pull kind of way up on things, we share with you the credit metrics that we see. And pretty much what you see is all that we see. So now we're all in the business of saying, where does this go from here? I shared with you some intuitive views that would lead to higher charge-off levels over time. And when we look at those, when we look at our card how we underwrite in card, we both can believe effects like this or -- will happen over time and also how strong the opportunity in card continues to be. \n So that's just a little window into how we think about that. And then that's sort of me talking, but then, of course, Andrew leads the whole process relative to -- and our Head of Credit, the whole process relative to the allowance build. But anyway, those are some thoughts about credit and how the kind of factors that may play out over time. So Aaron, yes. Let's just talk about purchase volume. So -- in Q1, our card purchase volume was up 10% year-over-year. And this grows while it's very solid, has decreased from the first part of 2022. But I think it's striking to separate out spend per active account and then like the growth of accounts and some of the benefits of our recent origination efforts. So if we look at spend per active account, now it was sort of -- it just really surge from the doldrums of the deep pandemic, then it really surged into the levels it was a year ago. \n We see spend per active account is pretty flat to a year ago. And it is -- and we can watch it on a typically, over the last few months, it has been sort of declining on that coming down to basically a sort of net result of being flat for a year ago or I think maybe it's actually in the last couple of months a little bit under where it was a year ago, if I remember the graph that I was looking at. \n Now initially, it's a funny thing how so often we see effects that start on the lower income, lower credit score side and then make their way up. I mean, pretty much the whole way credit has played out both on the improving side in the pandemic and then on the normalizing side, that's happened. But on spend, this slowing down happened in lower income segments first, but now it's more broad-based across income bands and really segments of our card business. So we, of course, are having very nice growth in accounts, and that's continuing to power purchase volume even as the spend sort of levels out. \n Now in the spirit of what are we rooting for, it seems to me to be a pretty rational thing for consumers to sort of level off this pretty strong spend that they have had. So I think what we see, we're pretty pleased with -- and then when we look at things like discretionary and nondiscretionary spending, both of them have slowed significantly over the last year. Well -- no, the growth rates have slowed significantly, but the category mix of spend, the more things change, the more they stay the same because basically pretty much across all the categories, things have returned to the pre-pandemic level. So yes, Ryan, I think the best net impression despite the fact that when we look at all our credit metrics, the -- some of them, like half of them aren't sort of back to pre-pandemic levels, and half of them are. My gut feel is it's a better net impression to view them as back. And I just think the underlying effects of continuing to lean into spenders, not only at the very top of the market, but within our segments and just the emphasis that we put on spend and some of the products, the marketing, the way we manage accounts, the kind of -- the people we raise lines to, et cetera. I just think there's been a subtle shift a little more towards the spending side. So I think that might explain why a few of these metrics are behind, but behind in terms of the -- but I think I walk around with the perception that things are pretty much at the levels of where they were a few years ago.\n So now we feel very comfortable with respect to the choices that we're making, and let's just talk about why that is. I've already said, we underwrite to assumed worsening. So let's go back to back when the behavior of the consumer was at levels we've never seen in the whole history of the company. The credit performance was so good. We just assumed that was unsustainable. We underwrote to much higher levels of losses. So as things normalize, that's not really sort of changing anything at Capital One. So we -- but at the same time, you see the noise all over the place on the horizon. So we obsessively look for -- we not only use all of our modern and machine learning-based monitoring tools to identify little pockets that might be gapping out from expected performance or prior performance or anything like that.\n And by the way, we have seen that in some pockets and then we dialed that back. We also hunt around and think about where would most intuitively the vulnerabilities be to where the economy is going. And we even anticipatorily kind of dial back around the edges there. But as I said earlier, I'm kind of struck by the number of new opportunities that are originating in terms of driven by the tech transformation of the company, new channels, new ways to succeed with customers that for kind of -- for every dial back that's happened, we seem to have had opportunities open up, and so we lean into those. \n And so it leads to my sitting in here and saying with respect to the card business, we feel, and I want you to walk away with that same net impression, the same level of optimism about our growth opportunities and our marketing and really the opportunity to create value in this part of the -- where we are in the cycle with card to be very strong. Now even as that happens, just to -- it's always striking to talk about the fact that the sibling of the card business, which is our auto business has been in a striking pullback mode over the very same period that we've been leaning in here and I partly point that out just to say that we don't at the top of the house, say there's just a green light out there.\n This is all very much one part of the business at a time, 1 segment, 1 business area, but that pullback in auto has been a minority of the pullback, but still an important part of the pullback has been credit driven in the sense of looking at things in the card business and trying to get ahead of any effects that we think might happen from a credit point of view, but the majority of the effects have been margin related, as we've talked about with the some of the marketplace not passing through into their pricing, the higher interest rates. And so the -- and so we have dialed back quite a bit in auto. But given that most of that dial back or certainly the majority of it is really more margin related and not so much credit related. We -- if things change and normalize a little bit more on the pricing side, we might be able to open up more opportunity in auto. \n But what I'm pleased about is the combination of the -- walking around with an intuitive model about how the marketplace works. And as I shared in the earlier answer, thinking about the ways customers -- credit can worsen and customers can do perform not as well as it might appear as we obsess about that, that informs our choices and then by monitoring at the margin and incredibly granularly to look for effects and then having the technology to move so quickly with respect to the identification, the diagnosis of what's going on, the root causes of it and then taking the action, which is a cycle that's way faster than it used to be before our tech transformation. \n All of these contribute to the ability to be able to move with confidence in a changing environment and probably has contributed to why the vintage curves sort of keep coming back -- coming in on top of each other despite a changing environment. And all of that finally leads to why we feel confident about our opportunities to lean into growth because every opportunity has a limited window, and we're the company that when we see those opportunities, we go after them. So Bill, I don't really -- I don't really have a -- I don't have a prediction about what exactly happens in the partnership business relative to merchant -- partnership agreements and then something as significant as the change in late fees comes and therefore, what do the collective -- the merchant and the issuer sort of do about that, I don't really have a prediction on that one. I just -- I wouldn't want to let your opening comment go just when you say, well, it's obviously much more probably for the people with partnerships than others because this -- where this legislation to come into effect, it has a significant impact on Capital One. So now there's a lot of miles to go before maybe everything works out. But just to comment on this for a second. \n First of all, with respect to the proposal, it's not final, and we -- the CFPBs will get lots of public comments. And we'll have to see how the rule-making process plays out. Late fees play in a very important role in the system because they provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid running into delinquency. And it's also a way that issuers can sort of price for risk, and all this leads to greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average.\n So we certainly have a point of view on this one. A change in -- a significant change in late fees could affect consumer payment behavior and delinquencies, it could affect access to certain parts of the population. So there's kind of a lot at stake. But what I wanted to say for Capital One, this is -- it's an important revenue source for Capital One. And we obviously are working on thinking about those impacts, what might be mitigating measures. And so we're early into our thinking about it, but I think not only for partnership-based companies. But for Capital One and maybe some other players as well, this is an important development that we're going to all have to take very seriously. Well, thank you, John. I'd forgotten all about. I know you've been around me for quite a while. I love metaphors, and sometimes metaphors, I think, can be pretty striking ways to think about things that otherwise are complex to talk about. But going back to the boring through the mountain. Remember, we were talking back then each quarter, we'd say, well, we're in -- what could be very whopping losses that come from the tremendous upheaval of the pandemic every quarter, we are boring through the mountain and with the government stimulus and so on. \n If we think back, we got all the way through the mountain to the other side. And it was better from a credit point of view than anything that we can kind of imagine. So if I pull up and just say, where am I just -- how do I feel about where we are. When I think about the health of the consumer, the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in an uncertain economy. \n The savings accumulated over the pandemic remain a positive for many consumers, that servicing burdens remain low by historical standards. The labor market, which is usually the most important economic driver of consumer credit performance remains strikingly strong, although we have seen some indications of some softening. \n Now you -- on the other hand, home prices have been falling a little bit. Inflation, I really believe none of us know really the effects of inflation, so we're going to be needing to manage intuitively here. We can't pull out PhDs to figure this one out. But -- so we assume the inflation is going to -- here's an interesting thought on inflation versus unemployment, John. \n Unemployment affects a small number of people terribly. Inflation affects all of us somewhat. And so from a credit point of view, I believe the reason unemployment has been the biggest driver is that because charge-offs happen at the tail of the distribution and the tail moves when the economy moves, so what is the effect of all of us losing a little bit of our purchasing power. My gut feel is it's just something that is slow in its effect. It's cumulative. It doesn't have the sort of precipitous effects that the unemployment does. But I still believe on little cat feet, there's another metaphor for you, John. \n I think it will play out. The other one, and it's almost -- I want to go back. I don't have a perfect metaphor for it, but I do want to say, again, I -- I've been around this business long enough to kind of know that extreme effects with respect to credit for a period of time, create the opposite effect on the other side, just -- it does with respect to markets and competition, but that's not even what I'm talking about here. I just -- I believe in life, let's just say there's always a certain percentage of consumers that are living on the edge, they're vulnerable and they don't have much of a buffer to absorb shock. \n So then when the global financial crisis came along, it was like a tsunami wave coming in and everyone who was -- I feel just so many people that were in a somewhat vulnerable situation got sort of washed over from that, that it was followed by this period where we had trouble keeping up with our own forecast of the losses. We -- in a good way in the sense that we finally said, this is the survivorship effect. The Great Recession accelerated so many charge-offs that at some point were statistically probably going to happen that we had a survivorship effect going on that anybody can survive that probably not charging off anytime soon, and that's why you sort of had there for the reverse of that effect.\n And I believe intuitively, I have no way to prove it and we'll never be able to quantify it, but just intuitively thinking about it when there were still vulnerable people all during the period of the pandemic, so many of them got lifelines that I think you can -- it doesn't mean there are lives necessarily changed. And I think you have sort of the reverse survivorship effect or maybe the sort of the catching-up effect from very, very low losses. And this is something that I believe is a real effect. And so if I pull up, I think the consumer is in a great shape. You're going to have sort of on little cat feet, the inflation effect and the catching-up effect and then you have a wildcard of a quite uncertain economy that creates greater volatility than usual in terms of where things might go. \n But in the context of all of that, and the opportunities we see -- one of the things -- sorry, it's a long answer to your question. But one of the things that you may remember my saying back when the credit was just unsustainably good a couple of years ago. I remember saying that there will be real consequences in the competitive marketplace if this abnormal environment continues for too low. And we really already saw it happen in the period of the extraordinary credit. What you saw is a tremendous inflow of FinTechs, you saw a huge expansion of credit, primarily in the subprime and even below sort of where we play in that space. \n We were worried that the underwriting that any of them were doing would be -- it's based on data, would definitionally not have a rear view, it would have a rearview mirror that is extremely unreliable. So I think when I would pull back this sort of great normalization that's happening even with some cat feet effects that are still probably going to play out is a very healthy thing to happen in terms of credit environment, competitive environments in the marketplace over time. So all in all, I feel really good about where we are. And if you detect optimism in my voice, you're getting the right read there. Yes. Well, the -- we've seen a lot of innovation over the last number of years. I'd add one to your list, one that really was quite a made quite a flash, which is buy-now pay-later that came into the marketplace. \n Let me really sort of start with that one. With buy-now pay-later came out, I remember having sort of saying this is kind of ironic because the original and still extraordinary buy-now pay-later product is called the credit card. So what is this new one that says, you can buy-now and pay-later. But anyway, it was riding on the back of some very, very clever technology sort of modern tech stacks and really good merchant relationships that made quite an impact on there. Now it was hailed as a revolution in payments from everything that we saw early on. I think it was, by the way, a very clever payment -- a very clever innovation, but it turned out to be more of a credit access play than necessarily. I'm not saying it isn't a revolution.\n Well, I'm saying that when we look at who flop there, it was a credit from looking at our bank customers and card customers, everything else, it was a credit access play and I think it's running into some challenges with respect to merchant discount rates and some credit challenges and other things, but it was certainly quite innovation. If you look at debit cards, anyone innovating in the debit card space that has access to the differential interchange that came from the law that created, tried to advantage smaller players versus bigger and networks other than -- well, different choices for different networks and different sized players. \n Anyone who has the fortune to ride on the back of that. I think that's a promising opportunity for them. And so payments -- the payment space will continue to evolve. One other thing about payments that when you look pull way up and say in what areas have FinTechs or major tech companies have the biggest impact on banking. It was -- we, of course, worried that all aspects of banking would get affected. But the biggest -- I think the biggest single area that has really been impacted is payments itself which -- when you think about it, that it's kind of the holy grail from a tech company's point of view because it's where the money is, and it's a real-time kind of customer experience activity. \n And importantly, it's not heavily regulated. For what it's worth the other play that I think the tech companies enduringly have had the greatest impact is in the platforms space, either payments platforms or other kind of platforms, building on modern tech stack. So those are some thoughts in the marketplace. But -- so just a reminder, Capital One has got to stay on the forefront of innovation or we can be yesterday's news. Okay. Thank you, John. So -- we are, of course, in the middle of litigation. So there's only so much -- I'm going to share in an earnings call about the various legal arguments being made by each side. But at a high level, Walmart has sued us trying to terminate the deal early, and we deny that they have a contractual right to an early termination. Walmart points to some service failures that we cured in 2022 and which had no impact on the value of the portfolio. Now in the meantime, we are committed to meeting our contractual commitments while we defend ourselves in court. And we will keep you updated on the litigation in our periodic SEC filings.\n With respect to timing of any potential impacts there are a lot of unknowns. There's the -- of course, the question of whether Walmart will win their litigation seeking early termination. And if so, when that will occur. We, of course, deny that they have a right to terminate early. Then there's a question of how long it will take for Walmart to transfer the portfolio to a new issue. We currently expect that the transfer of the Walmart portfolio to a new issuer would occur no earlier than January 2025, even if they win their litigation. So we will keep you updated if our timing expectation changes."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. \n I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $960 million or $2.31 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4 billion were flat to the fourth quarter and up 3% relative to the fourth quarter net of adjustments. Period-end loans held for investment declined 1% and average loans were flat. Total deposits grew throughout the quarter, increasing 4% on average and 5% on an ending basis. The increase in deposits was driven by strong retail deposit inflows, which was slightly offset by a decline in our commercial deposits. Our strong retail deposit growth drove our percentage of FDIC insured deposits, up 2% to end the quarter at 78% of total deposits. \n We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower noninterest income while net interest income was largely flat. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by a decline in marketing from the seasonally higher fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up about 2% on a GAAP basis and roughly flat net of the fourth quarter adjusting items. Provision expense was $2.8 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.7 billion and an allowance build of $1.1 billion.\n Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1.1 billion increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.3 billion as of March 31st. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.64%, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. In our allowance, our assumptions for key economic variables remain similar to those of last quarter. We continue to assume economic worsening from today's levels on most measures. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $867 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 69 basis points to 7.66%. Our build in the quarter was primarily driven by 3 factors: the first factor is the impact of underlying growth in the quarter, which replaced seasonal balances from the fourth quarter for which we held minimal allowance.\n The second factor is the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the first quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the first quarter of 2024. Recall that our allowance methodology uses a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, before it begins to revert to our historical loss average with additional consideration of qualitative factors. \n And finally, the third factor in our allowance build was the impact of acquiring the BJ's portfolio in the quarter. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $32 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio increased by 2 basis points and now stands at 2.82%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance increased by $245 million. \n The coverage ratio increased by 28 basis points and now stands at 1.82%. The allowance increase was driven by a $262 million reserve build related to our $3.6 billion commercial office portfolio. The coverage on the commercial office portfolio increased about 770 basis points and now stands at 13.9%. We have provided additional details on this portfolio on Slide 17 of the presentation.\n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 148%, up from 143% last quarter and 140% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by $20 billion to $127 billion, primarily driven by increased levels of cash. Our cash position ended the quarter at $47 billion, up $16 million from the prior quarter. This increase in our cash position was primarily driven by the strong consumer deposit growth I referenced earlier.\n We expect average cash balances in the near term to be elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. In addition to the higher cash, the market value of our AFS securities portfolio grew $5 billion to $82 billion at the end of the quarter. \n Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.6%, 24 basis points lower than last quarter and 11 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The 24 basis point quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by 2 factors: first, 15 basis points of the decline was a result of having 2 fewer days in the quarter; and second, the mix impact of the elevated cash balances that I previously described pressured NIM by approximately 11 basis points. Outside of these 2 effects, higher asset yields roughly offset higher funding costs.\n Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.5%, flat to the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets were offset by common and preferred dividends, the $150 million of share repurchase we completed in the quarter and a 17 basis point impact from the phase-in of the CECL transition. At the end of the first quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $6.7 billion. \n If we were to include the impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.5%, and we continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. \n Rich? I don't want to limit myself to a yes or no, Betsy, given the framing of your question. The short answer is no. And I will spare you from the allowance tutorial answer that I provided a quarter ago. But really, the mechanics are -- we have assumed for the losses or reserved for the losses that based on the current balances, that were on the books at the end of the quarter, what we assume we will experience over the next 12 months. And so if you're just replacing loan for loan with similar characteristics, you wouldn't otherwise have a build. I'm getting -- if I'm interpreting the nature of your question correctly. Well, Betsy, let me just clarify, and then I'll turn it over to Rich. When our guidance for efficiency relates to operating expenses, it is not a total efficiency point. And so it would exclude whatever choices we make in marketing from that calculation. But I'll turn it to Rich to respond to the broader question. Yes, Moshe, it's Andrew. We look at a number of things as we are considering our capital actions. And so I've been saying for a couple of quarters now, we've seen an increased level of uncertainty in the economic environment, wide ranges around growth opportunities and everything that's happened over the last 1.5 months has increased that level of uncertainty. And so we continue to believe that it's prudent to operate above our 11% long-term target, both until we have more clarity, both not only on the economic front, but to the potential regulatory changes that may be coming down the pike, which could very well include treatment of AOCI in capital. \n But of course, we don't know that yet. And so for now, we're continuing to operate above that long-term target. But suffice it to say, we have substantial capital generation capacity, and we regularly evaluate our plans in light of the economic changes in light of regulatory changes, we have the ability to pivot quickly in our deployment and certainly we'll do so when we feel like the time is right. Well, Rick, let me just clarify first. And I'm assuming you're just looking at the net interest income trends in other, which does serve as a clearing house for FTPs, but happy to talk to you offline in more detail about this. But the basic tenets of the FTP process or there's an arm's length transaction between corporate and other and deposits. And so they're getting a prevailing rate, which shows up in the revenue of either the Consumer Banking segment or the commercial banking segment. And so there isn't a subsidy or drag going on there. There's just a number of other clearing factors that happen in other. Yes. Let me start by talking about kind of what isn't in the disclosure that we provided because I know there's differences across various organizations. I mean as you know, Arren, that it's a little less than $4 billion and represents about 1% of our total loans, but this is our commercial office space. It is excluding, as you probably saw in the footnote, medical office and REIT and REIF medical office just has very different characteristics and so 2 does that's REIT and REIF. \n So in terms of the commercial office portfolio on our books, it's roughly 2/3 concentrated in New York, D.C. and San Francisco. It is roughly 60% B, C and obviously, 40% Class A. And so it has been accumulated over time, but it also was a business that up until a few years ago, we were active in, but we haven't had any new originations for the past few quarters and reduced our exposure to this segment over the past year by a little north of I think it's 10%. But given right now just the uncertainty that we see with office vacancies being elevated and utilization rates significantly below pre-pandemic levels and increasing debt service burdens despite the fact that we are getting 100% payment on principal and interest just in light of the continued uncertainty that I described just in terms of utilization and other factors. We decided to increase the coverage ratio quite a bit this quarter, and that's what you see in the disclosure in the back. It would, Bill. I was responding to what I interpreted to be Betsy's question of just individual vintages being the same, similar to what Rich just described. That in and of itself if you have a consistent growth rate wouldn't add to allowance. But if we're updating our assumptions a quarter from now and our economic view changes that will likely change our estimation of the loss content of the portfolio at that time. Well, as I said in my talking points, Sanjay, I think that is something that we do expect to remain at least elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. So yes, I would -- that's probably where I would leave that. Yes. Why don't I start with the second one first, which is -- if you look at our AFS AOCI, about 40% of that will pull to par between now and the end of '24. In terms of capital targets, I absolutely would not say it's a mechanical linkage that we are thinking about our capital targets inclusive of AOCI. There's a lot of uncertainty of regulatory treatment. It is not included in our regulatory ratios at this point. I just referenced that, that is one thing that we look at in addition to a number of other factors inclusive of just economic uncertainty and our growth opportunities. And so for now, we've been operating above our target. We're going to keep an eye on those things. And as we have more certainty of the future, we have a lot of flexibility with how we return capital to shareholders, if that's appropriate. Well, I'll go in reverse order on that one, too, because the beta will feed into the NIM response there. I'll remind you of my comments from a quarter ago, where I talked about cumulative deposit beta for the overall company could be somewhat higher than the last rate cycle, which was 41%. \n I think a quarter ago, our cumulative beta was in the mid-30s, where we sit today, it's 44. It is hard to predict how much further deposit betas will increase from here. There's a number of unique factors, especially following the events of the last month that makes predicting betas a challenge. Everything from product mix to the market in competitive pricing, if there's really intense competition from more insured deposits and just the sheer magnitude and pace of Fed fund hikes is unprecedented and what happens to on the other side when the Fed eventually starts lowering rates, and all of this is happening in the context of a Fed that's executing QT. \n So where we go from here is going to be impacted by a number of factors, customers' appetite for different deposit products, our focus on customer relationships, industry competition, funding needs. But I will say, given deposit pricing tends to lag asset yield resets. I wouldn't be surprised if there's at least some upward pressure on beta from where we were in the first quarter. So as I then pull that into thinking about NIM over time, that is likely a potential headwind for us, particularly in the near term given the lag of deposit pricing, where wholesale funding costs go could also be a headwind. And as credit continues to normalize, we could continue to see revenue suppression.\n So those are a few things that will potentially provide a headwind to NIM from where we sit today. But on the other hand, there's definitely some tailwinds even though my response to Sanjay's question in the real near term, I would think our average cash position will stay elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, not necessarily relative to what we saw in the first quarter. But over a longer period of time, that will almost assuredly come back down and eventually be a tailwind for NIM. We also could see a growing percentage of revolving card balances and in the immediate term, keep in mind, we'll have one more day in the second quarter.\n So I know that that's a lot of headwinds and tailwinds, but just wanted to give you a sense of all of the forces that play there."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norris, Senior Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norris: Thanks very much, Josh, and welcome, everyone. We're webcasting live over the Internet as usual. And to access the call on the Internet, please log on to Capital One's website at capitalone.com and follow the links from there. In addition to the press release and financials, we've included a presentation summarizing our third quarter 2024 results. With me today are Mr. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Andrew Young, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer. Rich and Andrew will walk you through this presentation.

And for more information on these factors, please see the section titled forward-looking Information in the earnings release presentation and the Risk Factors section of our annual and quarterly reports accessible at Capital One's website and filed with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion or $4.41 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to Discover integration costs and a small downward revision to our FDIC special assessment estimate. Net of these adjusting items, third quarter earnings per share were $4.51. Pre-provision earnings in the third quarter increased 3% from the second quarter to $4.7 billion. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 5%, driven by higher net interest income. Non-interest expense increased 7%, driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion in the quarter, down $1.4 billion relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the second quarter's one-time allowance build for the termination of the Walmart partnership, a decline in the coverage ratio in card and a $40 million decrease in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $134 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.5 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 7 basis points to 5.16%. The decrease in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by allowance releases in our Card and Consumer Banking segments. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, we released $66 million of allowance, which decreased coverage by 18 basis points to 8.36%. Our credit outlook has improved slightly as our confidence in the stability of underlying credit trends has grown, driving a modest release in allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, we released $50 million in allowance, resulting in a 10-basis point decrease to our coverage ratio. The release was driven by strong credit performance and increasing recoveries in our auto business. And finally, our commercial banking allowance decreased by $14 million, resulting in the coverage ratio remaining essentially flat at 1.76%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased about $9 billion to approximately $132 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $49 billion, up about $4 billion from the prior quarter, driven primarily by continued strong deposit growth. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 163%, up from 155% in the second quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 7.11%, 41 basis points higher than last quarter and 42 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The sequential increase in NIM was largely the result of three factors. First, we had higher card and auto yields. As a reminder, the card yield benefited from a full quarter impact of the termination of the revenue-sharing agreement with Walmart. The removal of revenue sharing increased the total company NIM by 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 22 basis points relative to the year ago quarter. Second, there was one additional day in the third quarter. And finally, we had a higher mix of card loans on the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.6%, 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Higher net income in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of dividends, loan growth and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, our Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of top-line growth, strong margins and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $9.1 billion or about 6% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 7% and third quarter revenue was up 10%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 43 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. The full quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement drove a 51-basis point year-over-year increase. Excluding this impact, the revenue margin would have been about 18.2%. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.61%. The full quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 38 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.23%, up 83 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.53%, up 22 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on the delinquency rate. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the third quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate, excluding the Walmart impact was down 63 basis points and the 30+ delinquency rate was up 39 basis points. Both sequential quarter trends are consistent with seasonal expectations. Domestic Card non-interest expense was up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, Domestic Card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the market, higher media spend and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows third quarter results in our Consumer Banking business. Auto originations were up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our stable credit performance, which is the result of choices we've made over the past couple of years, puts us in a strong position to lean into current origination opportunities in the marketplace. Consumer Banking ending loans were essentially flat year-over-year and average loans were down 1%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans and average loans were both up 1%. Compared to the year ago quarter, both ending and average consumer deposits were up about 6%. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 3% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 5% compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven largely by continued technology investments and increased auto originations. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.05%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate was 5.61%, down 3 basis points year-over-year, largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 2%. Average loans were down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were up about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 1%. We continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 1% from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was up by about 2%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the third quarter increased 7 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.22%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 7.66%, down 96 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 9 basis points to 1.55%. In closing, we continued to post strong results in the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of top-line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume and revenue. In the auto business, we saw year-over-year growth in originations for the third consecutive quarter and consumer credit trends remained stable. Our year-to-date operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments through September was 41.7%. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to the 43.5% we posted in 2023. Our view included the positive impact from the end of the revenue sharing related to the Walmart partnership and assumed the CFPB late fee rule would take effect in October. Looking forward, we now expect the full year 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be in the low 42s. We expect a sequential quarter increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter, that will be roughly in line with historical patterns as we continue to invest in our technology transformation. And we are no longer assuming that the CFPB late fee rule will be implemented in 2024, given ongoing uncertainty around industry litigation. Our view of 2024 marketing has not changed. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the Domestic Card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels. In Consumer Banking, we're leaning into marketing to grow our digital first national banking franchise. We continue to expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than in the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year and that includes the much higher marketing levels that we typically see in the fourth quarter. And turning to the Discover acquisition, we're working closely with the regulators as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process. Separately, Discover mentioned in their press release and on their earnings call last week that they continue to work in parallel with the SEC to resolve comments regarding their accounting approach for their card mis-classification matter. As soon as that process wraps up, we expect to mail out a joint proxy and a schedule -- and to schedule a shareholder vote most likely early next year. We remain well positioned to get shareholder and regulatory approvals and we expect to be in a position to complete the acquisition early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We will now start the Q&A session. Remember, as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any further questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nRyan Nash: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nRichard Fairbank: Hi, Ryan.\nAndrew Young: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So Rich, maybe to just start on credit. You obviously have lot -- you can see lots of different parts of the consumer market, high end consumer, subprime, prime, private label, different parts of auto. And you guys seem to be bucking the trend with really solid credit results, so I think some others aren't. So maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing across consumer and some of these different cohorts? And maybe what do you think it means for where losses could be headed in some of your main asset classes? Thanks. I have a follow-up.\nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thank you, Ryan. So let me just pull up and just talk first about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in the overall economy. You know, think about this. The labor market remains strong. You know we saw -- we saw signs of softening in the first half of 2024 and the unemployment rate picked up a bit, but the most recent data points on unemployment and job creation have actually shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing in real terms and last month, we saw a significant upward revision of the savings rate. Consumer debt servicing burdens are stable relative to pre-pandemic levels and consumers have higher average bank account balances than before the pandemic. Now we see some pockets of pressure related to sort of the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates. And we are almost certainly still seeing a thing that we've been calling out for years, even really before it happened saying we think it inevitably will happen and but we won't fully be able to measure that. We won't be able to measure that along the way, but that is delayed charge-offs from the pandemic period. We should remember that millions of consumers who would have charged off under normal circumstances in 2020, 2021 and 2022 avoided defaulting, thanks to unprecedented stimulus and forbearance. And these consumers were on the edge, and they got a lifeline. But for some of them, their underlying vulnerability remains. So I believe that what we're seeing today is some catching up from that period of historically low charge-offs. So I'd say consumers on the whole are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks, but I do think there's some pockets of pressure that will persist until we fully work through this cycle essentially of inflation and elevated interest rates and of course for an un-measurable period of time, the -- there will be, I think this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. So that's a comment, Ryan, sort of on the consumer generally. You said you had another question. Of course, I can get into Capital One's individual credit as well. But why don't I hear where you want to take this?\nRyan Nash: Yes. And it would be helpful if you can comment on Capital One specifically, but maybe I'll throw another question for Andrew and you guys can handle both of them. So Andrew, obviously, there was a big beat on the net interest margin and the Fed has begun easing. I'm just curious if you could maybe just talk about the drivers and expectations from the margin -- for the margin from here. And just given you've historically operated in this kind of 6.8% or 6.9% range. But given the balance sheet -- the changing balance sheet dynamics, do you think we've sort of broken out of that range? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Yes, Ryan. Look, as I think about the NIM in the near term, I enumerated the driving forces of what led to the increase this quarter. But in the near term outside of seasonal effects, we have one modest likely headwind, which as you can see in our disclosures, is that we're asset sensitive and so that will put a bit of pressure on NIM in the immediate term, but we also have one potential tailwind, I'll call it, and that is the pace of card growth relative to the rest of the balance sheet. And you've seen the tailwind to NIM all else equal over the last few quarters. Longer term, I think there's a few headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwind being again card even beyond the next few quarters, we've seen strong growth, particularly relative to the rest of our balance sheet. And I've highlighted in the past that our current levels of cash are likely above where we think they will eventually settle out. And if we were to see a steepening of the yield curve, that's also a good guide to us, all else equal. On the headwind side, I think there's a question of where betas go from here and there's a possibility that they could be slower or lower depending on a host of factors. We could maintain cash levels for some period of time at least, especially in light of the strong deposit growth we're seeing. And then always there's a little bit of a wildcard of the path of credit, right? And so if for some reason it stays elevated, the potential revenue suppression could be a headwind. But overall, I would say taking all of those factors into account, you've kind of seen the stability over the last few quarters prior to this one and the step-up here in the third quarter. And so I'll let you kind of weigh all of the headwinds and tailwinds that I just laid out for you.\nRyan Nash: Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: So, Ryan, let me just -- I talk generally about the consumer. Let me talk a little bit about Capital One, specifically what we see, and this is of course, partly because of what I just said about the consumer and some Capital One specific things as well. So in the Card business, we -- you know our delinquencies and charge-offs are consistent with normal seasonality now, and it's clear that our card credit has settled out. It's also clear that it settled out above pre-pandemic levels. And sort of there's three main reasons for this. First, we still have relatively lower recoveries compared to before the pandemic as a result of historically low charge-offs in the rearview mirror and therefore in our charge-off inventory. So our recovery rate per dollar of charge-offs has been stable, if anything, in fact a bit better than before the pandemic, but just the inventory remains below pre-pandemic levels. But it's rising, it's heading toward returning to the pre-pandemic levels. So this effect will diminish over the next few quarters, we would expect. Secondly, that we believe the cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates are creating affordability pressures for some consumers, particularly those whose incomes have not kept pace with inflation or have higher debt servicing burden. So we think that's a factor. And you know, to your point, I'm actually not making a point about the low end of the market, whether measured by income or credit score. Generally speaking, we've seen stronger relative income growth at the lower end of the distribution since 2020. And you know, customers with the highest debt servicing burdens tend to skew more prime than subprime. So -- and then, of course, the other factor, you know that we would point at as to why charge-offs are settling out above the pre-pandemic levels is the delayed charge-off effect that we think is still playing through. But just back -- if I could just throw in an industry point just for a second, I should have mentioned this probably earlier because this isn't really a Capital One effect. But I think that what we see in industry data is that post pandemic origination vintages are running at higher risk level than pre-pandemic vintages, probably because of inflated credit scores during the pandemic. And that's an industry point, not a Capital One point because and then here, Ryan, is when you mentioned that you're seeing Capital One credit, in some cases move differently from some of the industry trends. At Capital One, we anticipated these effects, related to some of the unusual things going on during the pandemic and particularly the -- what we might say is the great inflation of credit scores. So we tightened our underwriting back in 2020 and '21, when credit was the best we've ever seen. And as credit normalized, we continued to make adjustments where we saw pockets of rising risk, what I was saying along the way where we kept trimming around the edges. The result for Capital One has been relatively stable performance on our recent originations now for a long time, which are really running at similar levels of risk to pre-pandemic vintages. But I do think there is some underlying worsening in the marketplace that may be showing up elsewhere that some of our choices were able to offset. So pulling way up our credit results, we feel are strong and stable, driven by the choices that we've made through the pandemic and the post-pandemic period. And we feel very good about where we are and it's an important reason that we are leaning in, as you can see in terms of our originations in the business. I can talk about auto at some point, but maybe I'll wait for another question on that.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good evening. Just following up on credit, sorry. Just Rich, you had mentioned, maybe it was last quarter or the quarter before that we should start to see the credit, the delinquency improvements do better than seasonality. And I guess stabilized as you know, it's moving along with seasonality. Is some of that related to the stuff you were just talking about or do you still expect the improvement to be better than seasonality at some point?\nRichard Fairbank: Well, at some point, of course, you know, it can be a long time. But no, let me just say that I don't recall saying that we expected credit to be better than seasonality. I think what we have been saying over the last number of months is for a long time, we said credit is normalizing. We are on the absolute lookout for the very early signs of credit normalizing, which it should, where exactly it will normalize, who knows till we actually get there. And so way back to more than a year ago, starting interestingly in the lower end of the market, we were pointing out that we see the signs of credit stabilizing, of course, we all went down that ski slope of second derivative and that continues to, you know to be a strong effect. But these are all things, Sanjay, that are going on related to credit stabilizing. And we have not declared that we think, credit is in fact headed down from here. At some point, we can in another question, go through the potential, you know, case for that. I want to say one other thing though, you mentioned seasonality and I put a marker down last quarter about a potential seasonality, a change in seasonality patterns. And I'd like to just kind of seize the moment and comment on this because I think all of you that are watching the credit patterns on a monthly basis, it's really important that we talk about the seasonality benchmark to which to compare that. So let's talk for a moment about how seasonality works. Our portfolio in fact, tends to have more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. The second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and the fourth quarter tends to be the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we have always thought and still do that tax refunds are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February-March time period, which flows through to lower delinquencies in April, May and then to lower charge-offs in the August-September timeframe. Tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. Now a few years ago, the tax withholding rules changed leading to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. And the IRS was paying certain refunds later than before because of fraud-related issues that they had seen. Now, so we were watching all this, but there was so much noise in the payment data due to the pandemic that we were unsure to what extent credit seasonality patterns had changed. So in the first half of this year, as credit metrics settled out, we flagged that the combined effect of lower and later tax refunds as the more it settles out, the more we can sort of see these underlying patterns that we flag that this combined effect was likely affecting our near-term credit performance by delaying and muting the usual seasonal improvement that we see in the second quarter. But we didn't want to go to the highest mountaintop and declare that because we wanted to make sure we weren't explaining away credit numbers that in fact looked worse than seasonally what you would expect. We also at the time, you know, believed that we would see more muted seasonal increases in delinquencies in the third quarter on the other side of that effect. And we've now had several quarters to look at this and that experience has been confirmatory. And now that you know, we're in a sense, credit is coming in better than the old seasonal patterns. So we've seen both the worst side and the better side. I think we can pull up and really sort of declare this effect really seems to be happening. 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. So what we're basically seeing and pulling way up is that seasonality, which has we believe is driven predominantly by tax refunds, as tax refunds become less of an effect, not surprisingly, in fact, we're seeing seasonality that has less amplitude to it. So that's, I think, the seasonality that we observe now and when we've done sort of a -- an adjusted look at last year, we definitely think that we see the new trend. By the way on the auto side, all of this happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster and more concentrated way. So I think I just wanted to share that with you. But I think what we've really been declaring here, Sanjay, is that it's -- there's just such a confirmation that, that credit is really settling out here.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I mean my follow-up question would be the question you were looking for later. What's the path to normalization? And I guess for credit as well as the reserve rate, we're well above the levels we were in 2019, maybe you and Andrew can tag team on that one. Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: So why don't I start, Andrew. So the -- we're really, really pleased with how card credit has settled out after, quite a period of normalization. So looking ahead, while we're not giving guidance on future credit, I just want to point out a number of forces that play out. So the one force, of course is this thing that we believe so strongly is there, but we can't measure it is the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs. If you kind of look at the area under the curve of all the charge-offs that sort of didn't happen, now we don't believe all of that area will play out over time. But if you look at the area below the curve and compare it to the area in a sense above the curve now, one can see that conceptually there could be still quite a bit of, in a sense delayed inventory that could happen. I just want to flag that effect. I think it's going to moderate at some point, but I think that effect will be with us from -- for some time. Another factor is the recoveries inventory that continues to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then the moderating of inflation, I think, is a good guy for card credit, but still high interest rates are probably a source of pressure at the tails for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. And of course, the economy will be a factor too, but those are just some of the forces I think are going to be at work as credit plays out here, Sanjay.\nAndrew Young: And then with respect to allowance, Sanjay, obviously, we'll be allowing for growth. So that's the starting point on a dollar basis. I suspect you are more focused on coverage. So let me talk in coverage terms. First, and just very tactically, as a reminder near term, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonally higher balances, and those balances just have lower coverage because of the high levels of expected payments. So all else equal, and I stress that point, but that would put downward pressure on coverage in the fourth quarter. But I -- in hearing your question, I think you're looking for a longer-term view. So first, the coverage over time is going to primarily be driven by our loss forecast and our confidence in those estimates. And so Rich just kind of shared, the things that we'll be looking for and what will ultimately be driving those forecasts. But how the allowance then plays out relative to that, I think it's important to note that even if we find ourselves in future quarters where our projected losses are lower than the projected losses in the current quarter's forecast, we might see only modest declines in coverage as we incorporate uncertainties related to those projections. But eventually the -- that lower loss forecast if and when it comes through theoretically flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And so the direction of travel in that scenario would be down. The pace and timing would obviously depend on a variety of factors. Because you mentioned though CECL Day 1, I guess I'll end, Sanjay, just as a reminder, one other call out using CECL Day 1 as a rough proxy for a through-the-cycle coverage assumption, it's important to note that embedded in CECL Day 1 was a law-sharing agreement with Walmart. And so with the termination of that agreement, the roughly 50-basis point impact to allowance coverage that we recognized last quarter, I just want to make sure that as you're thinking about CECL Day 1 excluding the Walmart effect that 6.5% roughly percent is actually more like 7%. Hopefully, that gives you though a sense of the direction of travel.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Ma with Barclays. You may proceed.\nTerry Ma: Oh, thank you. Good evening. I wanted to touch on the auto business and ask kind of what you're seeing in a competitive environment and how you're thinking about growth going forward. You called out originations have been positive the last three quarters and it looks like loan growth is going to turn positive. I know you're still mindful of used-car prices. So should we expect more measured growth in auto going forward?\nRichard Fairbank: So yes, thank you, Terry. You know, our auto originations, as you say, they've been -- they've been growing now, I guess it's the last three quarters. And as we stated in our prior calls, in 2022 and in early 2023, we had anticipated risk and pullback on our originations. And even as the vehicle values have been declining, the credit performance on both our front book and our back book remains very strong. So additionally, just talking about some industry factors. Some of the headwinds that the industry has been facing with high interest rates and high vehicle prices are now easing as the interest rates have started to come down and vehicle values are down from their peak, although both of these remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. So interest margins are on our -- also very important, interest margins on our front book have increased and credit has stabilized and we're seeing opportunities to grow in a resilient way. So our strategy is to lean into areas that we like and that is supported by our very sophisticated underwriting and technology infrastructure, our data-driven decisioning as well as deep relationships with our dealer network. So looking ahead, we feel good about our auto business, and we feel we are well positioned to grow in a disciplined way targeting particularly what we think is the very resilient business.\nTerry Ma: Great. Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed. Bill, your line is now open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on your NIM commentary, Andrew, if credit continues to trend in line or potentially better than normal seasonality from here, is it reasonable to expect revenue suppression would begin to serve as more of a NIM tailwind that would arguably overwhelm some of the NIM headwinds that you described in your earlier response?\nAndrew Young: Outside of seasonality, Bill, which is an important qualifier to that, but yes, to the extent that credit is coming down in an absolute sense, suppression is highly correlated with loss rates. So over a period of time, that's what we would expect to see.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. And then also another follow-up for you, Andrew, on your reserve commentary. In prior quarters, qualitative overlays, it seems -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like it had the effect of preventing you from releasing reserves. Is it fair to conclude that this quarter's reserve release suggests you expect consumer credit conditions to continue to gradually improve from here to the point where, you know, that would support peak losses likely being -- or sorry, peak reserve rates likely being behind us at this point?\nAndrew Young: It's hard to think about the qualitative factors in isolation, Bill, because we look at the totality of the forecast and the economic backdrop. And that's just one albeit important but component of thinking about the allowance overall. So really the release this quarter was driven by the stability of underlying credit trends and just our confidence in those trends. So that's really the driver that led to this quarter's release.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my questions.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, Rich, on the Discover merger, do you still feel like owning a network helps your position with regulatory approval? I mean, I guess the DOJ suit against Visa does validate that. I'm just trying to get a sense on whether or not you feel like your arguments are resonating with regulators and you have confidence in the deal closing?\nRichard Fairbank: So I think it's, you know, this is an unusual deal in the sense that usually there is, a player in a certain industry doing an acquisition of another player in that industry and certain -- certainly part of the consideration is looking at those aspects, but the very unusual part here is two things. First of all, one is such an important part of this acquisition is buying a network, something that we don't have. So we're not even in that part of the business. But then secondly, of course, it is, you know, an acquisition buying a position in an industry that is, getting a tremendous amount of scrutiny for how concentrated it is. And the network that we are acquiring, for example, on the credit card side has gone from 6% down to 4% share in recent years. And so certainly, we are making a strong case that to a regulator that obviously has shown they care a lot about competition in that marketplace that we certainly believe that this is a very pro-competitive in that sense. Of course, we also believe very much that on the credit card side, the deal is pro-competitive as well.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. And yes. Yes, go ahead.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heck with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nJohn Heck: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered. I'm wondering if you guys can maybe give us some color on spend trends, the built business volumes. We've heard that there's -- that the consumer is being a little bit more cautious and careful or responsible with their spending as opposed to reacting to some sort of weakness or concerns about the economy. And I'm wondering what your opinion is on that and how that affects your business?\nRichard Fairbank: So, John, thank you. The -- consumer spending has had a little bit of a wild ride over the past few years. So just to reflect for a second on this, at the start of the pandemic spend per customer plummeted, then it surged as consumers resumed their spending and it has since been settling out. Since the beginning of 2023, our spend per customer has remained largely flat overall, although it has begun to tick up in recent months. So the spend growth that you see for Capital One is really being driven by the growth in new accounts and the spending on those accounts. And then we see just a little bit of a tick up in the last few months. Just to -- while I know some people have kind of wondered if you double click into the spend patterns, you know, discretionary and non-discretionary spend have really -- the growth rates of them have been very stable lately. And in fact, the mix has been stable across incomes and FICOs and is in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we think things really have settled out in the -- in the card business with respect to spend. And when we -- it's really striking when we look at banking overall and pretty much the only industry that's really growing is the credit card industry and it's been a tough way to make a living in most of the banking product areas and that of course, I think, the credit card continues to be part of a very -- a very important and multi-decade macro trend with respect to the movement out of cash and checks and really into the incredibly convenient spending mechanisms of a credit card. So I think there's sort of a macro tailwind that continues to help the industry. And then I think for a lot of us companies, certainly a few of us companies like Capital One, our strategies are very focused. It's what I call a spend first strategy so that a lot of what we do, the choices we make on the marketing side, on the credit side and really the business we want to be has a spend first lean to it and that that's another benefit to our metrics. Thank you, John.\nJohn Heck: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nMihir Bhatia: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And actually, just following up kind of similar lines as John's question about spending. Maybe just drilling down specifically on the venture ex-portfolio. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about it. It's been in the market for a couple of years now. Just how much has it grown, how material is it to the overall card business? What are you seeing in terms of performance in that portfolio that's encouraging you to invest more in it. But just any additional details would be great. Thank you.\nIme Archibong: All right. Thank you, Ime here. So we launched our Venture X card in late 2021, and we're very pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. This launch is, of course, a continuation in our journey that's been many years in the making to win at the top of the market and that journey started years ago with the declaration. And then we have continued to just sort of every year stretch a little higher and lean in to the momentum and the brand strength that we were getting in our market position to be able to keep growing. So Venture X was a very important milestone in that journey. And also, very important in that journey to win at the top of the market was the launch of our Capital One travel portal and the opening of Capital One lounges as well as enhancements to our customers' overall experience more broadly. So and I'm sure you saw that actually in the third quarter of last year, we then launched the Venture X business card and we're also pleased with the market response and customer engagement so far as well. So I guess the way -- while we don't give out the specific numbers on this, we continue to be very pleased with our quest to win at the top of the market and both of these Venture X products are getting a lot of traction so far. And as you can see, we're leaning in quite a bit. But again, what I want to say is, I think one of the mistakes that card companies sometimes make is to think about a quest to win at the top of the market related to we're going to launch a particular product with these features. I really want to stress that winning at the top of the market requires a sustained comprehensive effort to create experiences, access to things that are unique and sort of something to tell your friends about, lounges, digital experience, rewards, of course, and then a very important component of this is building the brand credibility to have -- be viewed as a premium player in that part of the marketplace. So all of that is what we're investing in. You've, of course, seen quite an increase in our marketing and a fair amount of that is in service of our continued quest at the top of the market. But I would leave this one observation with you as well is that while you see the overall purchase volume growth rate for Capital One, and when we -- when we break that data up by spend segment, basically the higher the spend segment, meaning the higher we reach up in the marketplace, the faster our growth rate is, which is a confirmation of the traction we're getting, but also not only in overall volume, but the traction that we're getting reaching farther up.\nJeff Norris: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Haynes with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nJohn Pancari: Hi, it's John Pancari at Evercore ISI. I wanted to just ask on capital CET1 ratio at 13.6%. I wanted to get your updated thoughts here on how you think about buyback in that context. I know you had indicated that the Discover transaction could impact the pace of buybacks ultimately, but you still bought back about $150 million in the third quarter. So I wanted to get your updated thoughts there. Thanks.\nAndrew Young: Yes, John, look, there's a few forces at play that impact how we think about capital management. The first, of course, being the uncertainty around the end game rule. The re-proposal provided some high-level indications, but the devils in the details there, not to mention the uncertainty on implementation timing. And second, although it's been moderating, of course, there still continues to be a degree of macroeconomic uncertainty. But last and perhaps most importantly, we have the pending Discover acquisition. And so post close, we will need to run both our internal assessment of the needs of the combined company, but we'll also go through the Fed's CCAR process to come up with our view and the Fed's view of the combined capital need -- the combined company entity's capital need. So those are the reasons why we are operating at current levels and believe it's prudent to do so. And we've been at this $150 million a pace for a number of quarters. And once we are back under an SEB regime, we'll, of course have flexibility to return capital as we see appropriate and you saw in late 2021 and early '22 when we had excess capital, we were returning that at something like $2.5 billion a quarter in repurchases. So if we were to find ourselves in a similar position, we understand that returning excess capital is an important part of creating shareholder value and we have the ability to do so quickly, but I go back to the forces at play of why we're operating where we are right now.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thank you, Andrew. If I could just ask one more on the loan yield increase, up about 58 basis points this quarter, how much of that increase was the impact from Walmart for the full quarter? And was there any impact on the APR from any increase to the APR in response to the proposed CFPB late fee rule? Thanks.\nAndrew Young: And John, I just want to make sure I understand your question of the yields quarter-over-quarter, are you saying or like year-over-year yield on card, year-over-year yield in card is flat when you take into account the effect of Walmart. Quarter-over-quarter, it's really just the seasonality effect. There's the partial quarter of Walmart, but yield is really the seasonal effects and partial quarter of Walmart when you're comparing third quarter to the second quarter.\nJohn Pancari: Okay.\nAndrew Young: And then...\nJohn Pancari: Okay, thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nJeff Adelson: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me to follow up on John's question there. Just on the late fee rule, I fully appreciate that things remain in flux at this point. But could you give us an update in your latest thinking and how you're potentially preparing for that with any offsets or mitigating actions? Have any of those actions been taken yet? And I get that you talked about taking a more mindful approach here. Just wanted to make sure that this is still the same approach you're taking or if there's anything else we should be thinking about in our models here? Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Thank you, Jeff. So at this point, we're waiting for industry litigation to play out to see if and when the late fee rule goes into effect. And we're not going to predict when that will happen. As we've said before, if the rule is implemented in its current form, it will have a significant impact on our revenue. But we also believe that the rule will have an impact on the marketplace, including competition, pricing, customer behavior, volumes, credit. The reality is that we have spent decades painstakingly building a customer first franchise with the fewest fees in the industry and extremely simple products. We believe that we've been rewarded for these choices with better growth, better attrition and better credit selection. Ultimately, we will work backwards from what preserves our customer franchise, our customer loyalty and credit resilience if the rule does go into effect. Relative to anything that we've done so-far, we -- really the only thing we've done is we did defer a few investments in anticipation of this rule being implemented. If the ruling never happens, we will likely go ahead and make these investments over time. Thank you, Jeff.\nJeff Norris: Well, that concludes our Q&A session for the evening. Thank you for joining us on this conference call today and for your continuing interest in Capital One. Everybody, have a great night.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows third quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the third quarter, our Domestic Card business delivered another quarter of top-line growth, strong margins and stable credit. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $9.1 billion or about 6% year-over-year. Average loans increased about 7% and third quarter revenue was up 10%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter increased 43 basis points year-over-year to 18.7%. The full quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement drove a 51-basis point year-over-year increase. Excluding this impact, the revenue margin would have been about 18.2%. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.61%. The full quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 38 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.23%, up 83 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.53%, up 22 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss-sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on the delinquency rate. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the third quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate, excluding the Walmart impact was down 63 basis points and the 30+ delinquency rate was up 39 basis points. Both sequential quarter trends are consistent with seasonal expectations. Domestic Card non-interest expense was up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, Domestic Card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the market, higher media spend and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows third quarter results in our Consumer Banking business. Auto originations were up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our stable credit performance, which is the result of choices we've made over the past couple of years, puts us in a strong position to lean into current origination opportunities in the marketplace. Consumer Banking ending loans were essentially flat year-over-year and average loans were down 1%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans and average loans were both up 1%. Compared to the year ago quarter, both ending and average consumer deposits were up about 6%. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 3% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 5% compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven largely by continued technology investments and increased auto originations. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.05%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. The 30+ delinquency rate was 5.61%, down 3 basis points year-over-year, largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows third quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 2%. Average loans were down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were up about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 1%. We continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Third quarter revenue was up 1% from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was up by about 2%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the third quarter increased 7 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.22%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 7.66%, down 96 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 9 basis points to 1.55%. In closing, we continued to post strong results in the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of top-line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume and revenue. In the auto business, we saw year-over-year growth in originations for the third consecutive quarter and consumer credit trends remained stable. Our year-to-date operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments through September was 41.7%. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to the 43.5% we posted in 2023. Our view included the positive impact from the end of the revenue sharing related to the Walmart partnership and assumed the CFPB late fee rule would take effect in October. Looking forward, we now expect the full year 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be in the low 42s. We expect a sequential quarter increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter, that will be roughly in line with historical patterns as we continue to invest in our technology transformation. And we are no longer assuming that the CFPB late fee rule will be implemented in 2024, given ongoing uncertainty around industry litigation. Our view of 2024 marketing has not changed. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the Domestic Card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels. In Consumer Banking, we're leaning into marketing to grow our digital first national banking franchise. We continue to expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than in the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year and that includes the much higher marketing levels that we typically see in the fourth quarter. And turning to the Discover acquisition, we're working closely with the regulators as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process. Separately, Discover mentioned in their press release and on their earnings call last week that they continue to work in parallel with the SEC to resolve comments regarding their accounting approach for their card mis-classification matter. As soon as that process wraps up, we expect to mail out a joint proxy and a schedule -- and to schedule a shareholder vote most likely early next year. We remain well positioned to get shareholder and regulatory approvals and we expect to be in a position to complete the acquisition early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Hi, Ryan. Okay. Thank you, Ryan. So let me just pull up and just talk first about the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of relative strength in the overall economy. You know, think about this. The labor market remains strong. You know we saw -- we saw signs of softening in the first half of 2024 and the unemployment rate picked up a bit, but the most recent data points on unemployment and job creation have actually shown renewed strength. Incomes are growing in real terms and last month, we saw a significant upward revision of the savings rate. Consumer debt servicing burdens are stable relative to pre-pandemic levels and consumers have higher average bank account balances than before the pandemic. Now we see some pockets of pressure related to sort of the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates. And we are almost certainly still seeing a thing that we've been calling out for years, even really before it happened saying we think it inevitably will happen and but we won't fully be able to measure that. We won't be able to measure that along the way, but that is delayed charge-offs from the pandemic period. We should remember that millions of consumers who would have charged off under normal circumstances in 2020, 2021 and 2022 avoided defaulting, thanks to unprecedented stimulus and forbearance. And these consumers were on the edge, and they got a lifeline. But for some of them, their underlying vulnerability remains. So I believe that what we're seeing today is some catching up from that period of historically low charge-offs. So I'd say consumers on the whole are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks, but I do think there's some pockets of pressure that will persist until we fully work through this cycle essentially of inflation and elevated interest rates and of course for an un-measurable period of time, the -- there will be, I think this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. So that's a comment, Ryan, sort of on the consumer generally. You said you had another question. Of course, I can get into Capital One's individual credit as well. But why don't I hear where you want to take this? So, Ryan, let me just -- I talk generally about the consumer. Let me talk a little bit about Capital One, specifically what we see, and this is of course, partly because of what I just said about the consumer and some Capital One specific things as well. So in the Card business, we -- you know our delinquencies and charge-offs are consistent with normal seasonality now, and it's clear that our card credit has settled out. It's also clear that it settled out above pre-pandemic levels. And sort of there's three main reasons for this. First, we still have relatively lower recoveries compared to before the pandemic as a result of historically low charge-offs in the rearview mirror and therefore in our charge-off inventory. So our recovery rate per dollar of charge-offs has been stable, if anything, in fact a bit better than before the pandemic, but just the inventory remains below pre-pandemic levels. But it's rising, it's heading toward returning to the pre-pandemic levels. So this effect will diminish over the next few quarters, we would expect. Secondly, that we believe the cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates are creating affordability pressures for some consumers, particularly those whose incomes have not kept pace with inflation or have higher debt servicing burden. So we think that's a factor. And you know, to your point, I'm actually not making a point about the low end of the market, whether measured by income or credit score. Generally speaking, we've seen stronger relative income growth at the lower end of the distribution since 2020. And you know, customers with the highest debt servicing burdens tend to skew more prime than subprime. So -- and then, of course, the other factor, you know that we would point at as to why charge-offs are settling out above the pre-pandemic levels is the delayed charge-off effect that we think is still playing through. But just back -- if I could just throw in an industry point just for a second, I should have mentioned this probably earlier because this isn't really a Capital One effect. But I think that what we see in industry data is that post pandemic origination vintages are running at higher risk level than pre-pandemic vintages, probably because of inflated credit scores during the pandemic. And that's an industry point, not a Capital One point because and then here, Ryan, is when you mentioned that you're seeing Capital One credit, in some cases move differently from some of the industry trends. At Capital One, we anticipated these effects, related to some of the unusual things going on during the pandemic and particularly the -- what we might say is the great inflation of credit scores. So we tightened our underwriting back in 2020 and '21, when credit was the best we've ever seen. And as credit normalized, we continued to make adjustments where we saw pockets of rising risk, what I was saying along the way where we kept trimming around the edges. The result for Capital One has been relatively stable performance on our recent originations now for a long time, which are really running at similar levels of risk to pre-pandemic vintages. But I do think there is some underlying worsening in the marketplace that may be showing up elsewhere that some of our choices were able to offset. So pulling way up our credit results, we feel are strong and stable, driven by the choices that we've made through the pandemic and the post-pandemic period. And we feel very good about where we are and it's an important reason that we are leaning in, as you can see in terms of our originations in the business. I can talk about auto at some point, but maybe I'll wait for another question on that. Well, at some point, of course, you know, it can be a long time. But no, let me just say that I don't recall saying that we expected credit to be better than seasonality. I think what we have been saying over the last number of months is for a long time, we said credit is normalizing. We are on the absolute lookout for the very early signs of credit normalizing, which it should, where exactly it will normalize, who knows till we actually get there. And so way back to more than a year ago, starting interestingly in the lower end of the market, we were pointing out that we see the signs of credit stabilizing, of course, we all went down that ski slope of second derivative and that continues to, you know to be a strong effect. But these are all things, Sanjay, that are going on related to credit stabilizing. And we have not declared that we think, credit is in fact headed down from here. At some point, we can in another question, go through the potential, you know, case for that. I want to say one other thing though, you mentioned seasonality and I put a marker down last quarter about a potential seasonality, a change in seasonality patterns. And I'd like to just kind of seize the moment and comment on this because I think all of you that are watching the credit patterns on a monthly basis, it's really important that we talk about the seasonality benchmark to which to compare that. So let's talk for a moment about how seasonality works. Our portfolio in fact, tends to have more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. The second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and the fourth quarter tends to be the seasonal high point. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we have always thought and still do that tax refunds are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February-March time period, which flows through to lower delinquencies in April, May and then to lower charge-offs in the August-September timeframe. Tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. Now a few years ago, the tax withholding rules changed leading to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments. And the IRS was paying certain refunds later than before because of fraud-related issues that they had seen. Now, so we were watching all this, but there was so much noise in the payment data due to the pandemic that we were unsure to what extent credit seasonality patterns had changed. So in the first half of this year, as credit metrics settled out, we flagged that the combined effect of lower and later tax refunds as the more it settles out, the more we can sort of see these underlying patterns that we flag that this combined effect was likely affecting our near-term credit performance by delaying and muting the usual seasonal improvement that we see in the second quarter. But we didn't want to go to the highest mountaintop and declare that because we wanted to make sure we weren't explaining away credit numbers that in fact looked worse than seasonally what you would expect. We also at the time, you know, believed that we would see more muted seasonal increases in delinquencies in the third quarter on the other side of that effect. And we've now had several quarters to look at this and that experience has been confirmatory. And now that you know, we're in a sense, credit is coming in better than the old seasonal patterns. So we've seen both the worst side and the better side. I think we can pull up and really sort of declare this effect really seems to be happening. 2024 settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about 25% lower total refund volume in real terms. So what we're basically seeing and pulling way up is that seasonality, which has we believe is driven predominantly by tax refunds, as tax refunds become less of an effect, not surprisingly, in fact, we're seeing seasonality that has less amplitude to it. So that's, I think, the seasonality that we observe now and when we've done sort of a -- an adjusted look at last year, we definitely think that we see the new trend. By the way on the auto side, all of this happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster and more concentrated way. So I think I just wanted to share that with you. But I think what we've really been declaring here, Sanjay, is that it's -- there's just such a confirmation that, that credit is really settling out here. So why don't I start, Andrew. So the -- we're really, really pleased with how card credit has settled out after, quite a period of normalization. So looking ahead, while we're not giving guidance on future credit, I just want to point out a number of forces that play out. So the one force, of course is this thing that we believe so strongly is there, but we can't measure it is the phenomenon of delayed charge-offs. If you kind of look at the area under the curve of all the charge-offs that sort of didn't happen, now we don't believe all of that area will play out over time. But if you look at the area below the curve and compare it to the area in a sense above the curve now, one can see that conceptually there could be still quite a bit of, in a sense delayed inventory that could happen. I just want to flag that effect. I think it's going to moderate at some point, but I think that effect will be with us from -- for some time. Another factor is the recoveries inventory that continues to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then the moderating of inflation, I think, is a good guy for card credit, but still high interest rates are probably a source of pressure at the tails for some consumers, especially those with higher debt servicing burdens. And of course, the economy will be a factor too, but those are just some of the forces I think are going to be at work as credit plays out here, Sanjay. So yes, thank you, Terry. You know, our auto originations, as you say, they've been -- they've been growing now, I guess it's the last three quarters. And as we stated in our prior calls, in 2022 and in early 2023, we had anticipated risk and pullback on our originations. And even as the vehicle values have been declining, the credit performance on both our front book and our back book remains very strong. So additionally, just talking about some industry factors. Some of the headwinds that the industry has been facing with high interest rates and high vehicle prices are now easing as the interest rates have started to come down and vehicle values are down from their peak, although both of these remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. So interest margins are on our -- also very important, interest margins on our front book have increased and credit has stabilized and we're seeing opportunities to grow in a resilient way. So our strategy is to lean into areas that we like and that is supported by our very sophisticated underwriting and technology infrastructure, our data-driven decisioning as well as deep relationships with our dealer network. So looking ahead, we feel good about our auto business, and we feel we are well positioned to grow in a disciplined way targeting particularly what we think is the very resilient business. So I think it's, you know, this is an unusual deal in the sense that usually there is, a player in a certain industry doing an acquisition of another player in that industry and certain -- certainly part of the consideration is looking at those aspects, but the very unusual part here is two things. First of all, one is such an important part of this acquisition is buying a network, something that we don't have. So we're not even in that part of the business. But then secondly, of course, it is, you know, an acquisition buying a position in an industry that is, getting a tremendous amount of scrutiny for how concentrated it is. And the network that we are acquiring, for example, on the credit card side has gone from 6% down to 4% share in recent years. And so certainly, we are making a strong case that to a regulator that obviously has shown they care a lot about competition in that marketplace that we certainly believe that this is a very pro-competitive in that sense. Of course, we also believe very much that on the credit card side, the deal is pro-competitive as well. Yes. And yes. Yes, go ahead. So, John, thank you. The -- consumer spending has had a little bit of a wild ride over the past few years. So just to reflect for a second on this, at the start of the pandemic spend per customer plummeted, then it surged as consumers resumed their spending and it has since been settling out. Since the beginning of 2023, our spend per customer has remained largely flat overall, although it has begun to tick up in recent months. So the spend growth that you see for Capital One is really being driven by the growth in new accounts and the spending on those accounts. And then we see just a little bit of a tick up in the last few months. Just to -- while I know some people have kind of wondered if you double click into the spend patterns, you know, discretionary and non-discretionary spend have really -- the growth rates of them have been very stable lately. And in fact, the mix has been stable across incomes and FICOs and is in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we think things really have settled out in the -- in the card business with respect to spend. And when we -- it's really striking when we look at banking overall and pretty much the only industry that's really growing is the credit card industry and it's been a tough way to make a living in most of the banking product areas and that of course, I think, the credit card continues to be part of a very -- a very important and multi-decade macro trend with respect to the movement out of cash and checks and really into the incredibly convenient spending mechanisms of a credit card. So I think there's sort of a macro tailwind that continues to help the industry. And then I think for a lot of us companies, certainly a few of us companies like Capital One, our strategies are very focused. It's what I call a spend first strategy so that a lot of what we do, the choices we make on the marketing side, on the credit side and really the business we want to be has a spend first lean to it and that that's another benefit to our metrics. Thank you, John. Thank you."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $1.8 billion or $4.41 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to Discover integration costs and a small downward revision to our FDIC special assessment estimate. Net of these adjusting items, third quarter earnings per share were $4.51. Pre-provision earnings in the third quarter increased 3% from the second quarter to $4.7 billion. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 5%, driven by higher net interest income. Non-interest expense increased 7%, driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion in the quarter, down $1.4 billion relative to the prior quarter. The quarterly decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the second quarter's one-time allowance build for the termination of the Walmart partnership, a decline in the coverage ratio in card and a $40 million decrease in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We released $134 million in allowance this quarter, and our allowance balance now stands at $16.5 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased 7 basis points to 5.16%. The decrease in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by allowance releases in our Card and Consumer Banking segments. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, we released $66 million of allowance, which decreased coverage by 18 basis points to 8.36%. Our credit outlook has improved slightly as our confidence in the stability of underlying credit trends has grown, driving a modest release in allowance. In our Consumer Banking segment, we released $50 million in allowance, resulting in a 10-basis point decrease to our coverage ratio. The release was driven by strong credit performance and increasing recoveries in our auto business. And finally, our commercial banking allowance decreased by $14 million, resulting in the coverage ratio remaining essentially flat at 1.76%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased about $9 billion to approximately $132 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $49 billion, up about $4 billion from the prior quarter, driven primarily by continued strong deposit growth. Our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 163%, up from 155% in the second quarter. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our third quarter net interest margin was 7.11%, 41 basis points higher than last quarter and 42 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The sequential increase in NIM was largely the result of three factors. First, we had higher card and auto yields. As a reminder, the card yield benefited from a full quarter impact of the termination of the revenue-sharing agreement with Walmart. The removal of revenue sharing increased the total company NIM by 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 22 basis points relative to the year ago quarter. Second, there was one additional day in the third quarter. And finally, we had a higher mix of card loans on the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.6%, 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Higher net income in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of dividends, loan growth and $150 million of share repurchases. As a reminder, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. Therefore, we continue to be subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Hi, Ryan. Yes, Ryan. Look, as I think about the NIM in the near term, I enumerated the driving forces of what led to the increase this quarter. But in the near term outside of seasonal effects, we have one modest likely headwind, which as you can see in our disclosures, is that we're asset sensitive and so that will put a bit of pressure on NIM in the immediate term, but we also have one potential tailwind, I'll call it, and that is the pace of card growth relative to the rest of the balance sheet. And you've seen the tailwind to NIM all else equal over the last few quarters. Longer term, I think there's a few headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwind being again card even beyond the next few quarters, we've seen strong growth, particularly relative to the rest of our balance sheet. And I've highlighted in the past that our current levels of cash are likely above where we think they will eventually settle out. And if we were to see a steepening of the yield curve, that's also a good guide to us, all else equal. On the headwind side, I think there's a question of where betas go from here and there's a possibility that they could be slower or lower depending on a host of factors. We could maintain cash levels for some period of time at least, especially in light of the strong deposit growth we're seeing. And then always there's a little bit of a wildcard of the path of credit, right? And so if for some reason it stays elevated, the potential revenue suppression could be a headwind. But overall, I would say taking all of those factors into account, you've kind of seen the stability over the last few quarters prior to this one and the step-up here in the third quarter. And so I'll let you kind of weigh all of the headwinds and tailwinds that I just laid out for you. And then with respect to allowance, Sanjay, obviously, we'll be allowing for growth. So that's the starting point on a dollar basis. I suspect you are more focused on coverage. So let me talk in coverage terms. First, and just very tactically, as a reminder near term, in the fourth quarter, we typically have seasonally higher balances, and those balances just have lower coverage because of the high levels of expected payments. So all else equal, and I stress that point, but that would put downward pressure on coverage in the fourth quarter. But I -- in hearing your question, I think you're looking for a longer-term view. So first, the coverage over time is going to primarily be driven by our loss forecast and our confidence in those estimates. And so Rich just kind of shared, the things that we'll be looking for and what will ultimately be driving those forecasts. But how the allowance then plays out relative to that, I think it's important to note that even if we find ourselves in future quarters where our projected losses are lower than the projected losses in the current quarter's forecast, we might see only modest declines in coverage as we incorporate uncertainties related to those projections. But eventually the -- that lower loss forecast if and when it comes through theoretically flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And so the direction of travel in that scenario would be down. The pace and timing would obviously depend on a variety of factors. Because you mentioned though CECL Day 1, I guess I'll end, Sanjay, just as a reminder, one other call out using CECL Day 1 as a rough proxy for a through-the-cycle coverage assumption, it's important to note that embedded in CECL Day 1 was a law-sharing agreement with Walmart. And so with the termination of that agreement, the roughly 50-basis point impact to allowance coverage that we recognized last quarter, I just want to make sure that as you're thinking about CECL Day 1 excluding the Walmart effect that 6.5% roughly percent is actually more like 7%. Hopefully, that gives you though a sense of the direction of travel. Outside of seasonality, Bill, which is an important qualifier to that, but yes, to the extent that credit is coming down in an absolute sense, suppression is highly correlated with loss rates. So over a period of time, that's what we would expect to see. It's hard to think about the qualitative factors in isolation, Bill, because we look at the totality of the forecast and the economic backdrop. And that's just one albeit important but component of thinking about the allowance overall. So really the release this quarter was driven by the stability of underlying credit trends and just our confidence in those trends. So that's really the driver that led to this quarter's release. Yes, John, look, there's a few forces at play that impact how we think about capital management. The first, of course, being the uncertainty around the end game rule. The re-proposal provided some high-level indications, but the devils in the details there, not to mention the uncertainty on implementation timing. And second, although it's been moderating, of course, there still continues to be a degree of macroeconomic uncertainty. But last and perhaps most importantly, we have the pending Discover acquisition. And so post close, we will need to run both our internal assessment of the needs of the combined company, but we'll also go through the Fed's CCAR process to come up with our view and the Fed's view of the combined capital need -- the combined company entity's capital need. So those are the reasons why we are operating at current levels and believe it's prudent to do so. And we've been at this $150 million a pace for a number of quarters. And once we are back under an SEB regime, we'll, of course have flexibility to return capital as we see appropriate and you saw in late 2021 and early '22 when we had excess capital, we were returning that at something like $2.5 billion a quarter in repurchases. So if we were to find ourselves in a similar position, we understand that returning excess capital is an important part of creating shareholder value and we have the ability to do so quickly, but I go back to the forces at play of why we're operating where we are right now. And John, I just want to make sure I understand your question of the yields quarter-over-quarter, are you saying or like year-over-year yield on card, year-over-year yield in card is flat when you take into account the effect of Walmart. Quarter-over-quarter, it's really just the seasonality effect. There's the partial quarter of Walmart, but yield is really the seasonal effects and partial quarter of Walmart when you're comparing third quarter to the second quarter. And then... Thank you, Jeff. So at this point, we're waiting for industry litigation to play out to see if and when the late fee rule goes into effect. And we're not going to predict when that will happen. As we've said before, if the rule is implemented in its current form, it will have a significant impact on our revenue. But we also believe that the rule will have an impact on the marketplace, including competition, pricing, customer behavior, volumes, credit. The reality is that we have spent decades painstakingly building a customer first franchise with the fewest fees in the industry and extremely simple products. We believe that we've been rewarded for these choices with better growth, better attrition and better credit selection. Ultimately, we will work backwards from what preserves our customer franchise, our customer loyalty and credit resilience if the rule does go into effect. Relative to anything that we've done so-far, we -- really the only thing we've done is we did defer a few investments in anticipation of this rule being implemented. If the ruling never happens, we will likely go ahead and make these investments over time. Thank you, Jeff."

And with that done, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?\nAndrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $597 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to the Walmart partnership termination, Discover integration costs, and an accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC's special assessment. Net of these adjusting items, second quarter earnings per share were $3.14. Relative to the prior quarter, period end loans held for investment increased 1%, while average loans were flat. Ending deposits were flat versus last quarter, while average deposits increased 1%. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits increased 1 percentage point to 83% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the second quarter increased 7% from the first quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%, driven by higher net and non-interest income, while non-interest expense decreased 4%, driven by a decline in operating expense. Our provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion in the quarter. The $1.2 billion increase in provision relative to the prior quarter was almost entirely driven by higher allowance. Included in the second quarter was an $826 million allowance built from the elimination of the loss sharing provisions that occurred within the termination of the Walmart partnership. The remaining quarter-over-quarter provision increase was driven by a $353 million higher net reserve build and a $28 million increase in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $1.3 billion in allowance this quarter. The allowance balance now stands at $16.6 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 35 basis points to 5.23%. The increase in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by a build in our card segment. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our domestic card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 69 basis points to 8.54%. The substantial majority of the increase in coverage was driven by the impact of the termination of the Walmart loss sharing agreement. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance decreased by $23 million, resulting in a 5 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. And finally, our commercial banking allowance increased by $6 million. Coverage ratio remained essentially flat at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased about $5 billion to approximately $123 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by wholesale funding maturities, loan growth, and declines in our commercial deposits, partially offset by deposit growth in our retail banking business. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 155%, down from 164% in the first quarter. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.7%, 1 basis point higher than last quarter and 22 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The relatively flat quarter-over-quarter NIM was the result of largely offsetting factors. NIM in the quarter benefited from the termination of the revenue sharing agreement with Walmart as well as modestly higher yields in the auto business. These two factors were roughly offset by the seasonal effects on yield in the card portfolio and a slight increase in the rate paid on retail deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.2%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was largely offset by the impact of dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is 5.5%, resulting in a CET1 requirement of 10%. However, as we disclosed in our last 10-Q, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. As a result, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows second quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the second quarter, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of strong results as we continued to invest in flagship products and exceptional customer experiences to grow our franchise. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $11.1 billion or about 8% year-over-year. Average loans also increased about 8% and second quarter revenue was up 9%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter remained strong at 17.9%. The revenue margin includes a positive impact of about 18 basis points resulting from the partial quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.05%. The partial quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 19 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.86%, up 148 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.14%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rates. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the second quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate excluding the Walmart impact was down 8 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 34 basis points. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the marketplace, higher media spend, and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. After returning to positive growth last quarter, auto originations were up 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. Consumer banking ending loans were down $1.6 billion or 2% year-over-year and average loans were down 3%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1% and average loans were flat. Compared to the year ago quarter, ending consumer deposits were up about 7% and average deposits were up 5%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 9% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs and lower average loans compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.81%, up 41 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.67%, up 29 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 3%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was lower by about 6%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the second quarter increased 2 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.15%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.62%, up 23 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 18 basis points to 1.46%. In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter. We delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue and a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in auto originations. Consumer credit trends continued to show stability and our operating efficiency ratio improved. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustment to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023, assuming the CFPB late fee rule takes effect in October. And we're on a very consistent path with what we expected when we gave that guidance. If the implementation of the rule is delayed, that would be a tailwind to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio. One thing that has changed is the Walmart relationship. Our partnership ended in the second quarter, which will increase charge-off rates, but have a positive impact on operating efficiency ratio. Including the Walmart impact, we expect full year 2024 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to 2023. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the domestic card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels and our origination opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, which enables us to leverage machine learning at scale to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and customize our marketing offers. We are also getting traction in building our franchise at the top of the market with heavy spenders. It is not lost on us that competitive intensity and marketing levels are increasing at the very top of the market and we know we have important investments to make. We continue to be pleased to see our investments pay-off in customer and spend growth and returns. And we're building and enduring franchise with annuity like revenue streams, very low losses, and very low attrition. In consumer banking, our modern technology and leading digital capabilities are powering our digital first national banking strategy, and we're leaning even harder into marketing to grow our national checking franchise, which has had industry leading pricing with no fees and industry leading customer satisfaction. Pulling up, marketing is a key driver of current and future growth and value creation across the company and we're leaning hard into our marketing investments. We expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year. We are all-in and working hard to complete the Discover acquisition. Our applications for regulatory approval are in process and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. We continue to expect that we'll be in a position to complete the acquisition late this year or early next year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payments network positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform, and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses, and consumers and driving enhanced network growth. In credit cards and consumer banking, we're bringing together proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer. And we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 year technology transformation across every business and the network. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?\nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Josh, please start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may proceed.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Rich, Andrew, just looking at the credit metrics, as Rich mentioned, it seems like the trends are pretty favorable. I mean, in most segments things are improving, if not stable. And then the U.S. card, there is an improving trend in that second derivative. I'm just curious how we should think about reserve rate going forward because I think even excluding the Walmart impact, the reserve rate went higher.\nAndrew Young: Sure, Sanjay. Well, let me start by covering this quarter's allowance and then I'll talk about the future. So in the quarter, as you said, first, we had the effect of Walmart, the $826 million build that we spelled out as an adjusting item. We also reserved for the growth we saw in the quarter. Beyond that coverage in card, as you referenced, grew, I think it was just over 10 basis points, which is a little over 1% of the allowance balance. And so, as part of that process each quarter, not only are we rolling forward our baseline forecast, but we're also looking at a range of macroeconomic and consumer behavior uncertainties, including things like the changing seasonal customer behavior we talked about last quarter. And so as a result, in this quarter, we increased the qualitative factors to reflect those uncertainties and that's what drove the modest increase in coverage this quarter. As I look ahead and talking conceptually here, but in a period where projected loss rates in future quarters are projected to stabilize and ultimately decline and might indicate a decline in the coverage ratio, I would say, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat for some period of time as we incorporate the uncertainty of those future projections into the allowance. And in a period where forecasted losses are rising, we're quick to incorporate those higher forecasted losses and also potentially add qualitative factors for uncertainty like you saw early in the pandemic, but I would say it is unlikely to be symmetric on the way down. And so eventually, the projected stabilizing and ultimately lower losses will flow through the allowance, particularly as the uncertainties around that forecast become more certain. But at this point, I'm not going to be in the business of forecasting when that's actually going to take place for us.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And then, Rich, maybe you could just talk about the consumer and sort of the uncertainties there. Is there any discernible like change that you've seen since the last quarter in terms of the state of the consumer? We've obviously seen the spending trends sort of slow somewhat across the industry. But anything else to sort of point out?\nRichard Fairbank: Sanjay, I think what we see is something that's very stable. The U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. Of course, the labor market remains strikingly resilient. Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards despite high interest rates. When we look at our customers, we see that on average, they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels. On the other hand, inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and we've only recently seen real wage growth turn positive again. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class, mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. So we'll obviously keep an eye on that. And I think at the margin, these effects are almost certainly stretching some consumers financially. But on the whole, I think I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. And as our credit numbers came in five months [Technical Difficulty] I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Can you still hear me? You can hear me, okay? I just had some cross message coming in on my phone. But with respect to credit, we were very pleased with the credit performance in the quarter. We had talked a bit about the seasonality, maybe people want to ask question about that, but we saw basically pulling up, we see things settling out nicely in the card business and there things are very strong in the auto business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just turning to NIM for a second. With the Fed or at least expectations for rate cuts coming into view, can you just comment on the current backdrop for deposit competition? How do you -- and how do you expect deposit betas to trend during the early stages of the Fed rate cutting cycle?\nRichard Fairbank: Sure, Mihir. Like, what we've seen at least within our walls and you saw it as evidence of it this quarter in a quarter where seasonally you typically see a decline in deposit balances. Looking at H8 (ph) data, we saw a few -- I think it was $4 billion of growth. We've been quite pleased over the course of the last couple of years with all of the investments we've made over many years in building a deposit franchise and are certainly benefiting from that. And so with respect to the beta going forward, first, looking at what we saw in the upcycle here in the total cumulative beta that we've seen in this cycle this quarter, I think cumulatively it was 62% and so assuming that the Fed's next move is to bring rates down. It's hard to precisely predict what's going to happen to deposit costs and therefore betas, and in particular, the pace of those declines because market dynamics, competitive pricing actions, other actions related to companies looking to potentially preserve NIM, that's going to drive betas in the future cycle. But I think you get a pretty good sense for our pricing and mix based on what you saw in the upcycle and within that backdrop that I just described, that's going to influence what happens to our beta on the way down.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just switching back to the health of the customer overall. As you look across your portfolio, we've heard a little bit of talk about pull -- people pulling back, particularly on discretionary spend and lower income cohorts, etc. Is that a dynamic you are also seeing when you look at your customer base? And then relatedly, Rich mentioned how pleased he is with the progress you're making on the higher income side, if you will, on the big -- on the transactor in that high end transactor balance side. I was just wondering, how does that change your portfolio as you think about it like over the next few years, like as you grow that book further?\nRichard Fairbank: Yes. Well, thank you so much. Just with respect to spending, we see pretty proportional movements in discretionary versus non-discretionary spending, nothing really striking there when we look at the portfolio spending metrics. The spend per customer is really pretty flat. When you see spend growth at a company like Capital One, the purchase volume growth is really being driven by the new accounts. So things are really pretty stable, flat and stable, healthy, but pretty flat on a per-customer basis. With respect to the question about the gradual transition of our portfolio to a higher end customer, let me just pull up and talk about that. We have for decades been a company that sort of serves the mass market really from the top of the credit spectrum through to even down to some subprime customers. And we have continued very consistently with this strategy, probably the most striking thing though that's happened over the last 10 or 14 years, I guess, 14 years ago is when we launched the Venture Card. We have systematically leaned into going after the top of the market, not leaving the other behind, but really as an additive strategy. And we have continued through our marketing and through the products that we're offering to just keep moving higher and higher in terms of the target customers and the traction that we're getting. And by the way, we continue even as we're growing purchase volume overall, where we see the highest growth rates in purchase volume are as we go higher in the market. So we're very happy about that. And when we think about the portfolio effects that happened there, this is one thing that we see is that payment rates have along that journey gone up quite a bit at Capital One. And when we look to see our payment rates coming back to where they were pre-pandemic, they sort of -- they probably just aren't going to return all the way because that would be a reflection of the portfolio shift. We just in general have had the kind of mix shift that you'd expect with higher payment rates and a -- just higher levels of spend, higher spend rates in the business and that's been very successful. So -- but from an outstanding's point of view, it doesn't -- the top of the market business doesn't have that much impact on outstandings because these folks generally pay in full. So when you see the outstandings movements of Capital One, it's pretty consistently driven by the mass market part of our business. It's just that inside some of the portfolio, metrics are moving because of the mix shift toward more spenders.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.\nRichard Shane: Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, given the breadth of your reach across the consumer income levels. Can you talk a little bit about sort of any patterns that you're seeing? We've heard, for example, some slowdown in spending for lower-income consumers. I'm curious, particularly you had made a comment earlier in the quarter about an increase in minimum payment rates. I'm curious if you're seeing anything in terms of payment behavior that we should consider by income level.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Okay. So let's just pull up for a minute on just talking about how the subprime consumer is holding up. So, way back in the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions. Subprime, also worsened less on a percentage basis than prime, but of course, it -- in absolute delta, it still moved more. In the pandemic, subprime credit moved more and more quickly than prime. It normalized more quickly and appears to be stable and appeared basically to stabilize sooner as well. And that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and forbearance on financial products and then the unwinding of that over time. And so subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they're correlated and we saw these effects across credit both in talking about the credit spectrum and also the income gradients. So on the other hand, just a couple of other effects just on the credit side that have happened over the recent years. Subprime consumers have been subject to more industry credit supply, including fintech competition during and after the pandemic. So that's been something we've always kept a close eye on and worried about whether that was going to disproportionately impact the credit performance of subprime for customers. I don't really -- I mean, given the overall pretty strong performance in subprime, I think we haven't seen that effect too much. And another thing to point out is that income growth has been consistently higher for lower income consumers over the past several years and this is the opposite of what we saw during and after the global financial crisis. But while no two cycles alike -- are alike, I think again we're seeing that subprime consumers and lower income consumers again they're not the same thing, but they tend to move earlier, but not necessarily more than the overall market. Now when you -- let's talk a little bit about payment rates. So throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increased not only for us but across the industry. And more recently payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs as the effects of stimulus have waned. And the payment rates generally we have seen this effect, so the effect that we've seen of payment rates going down relative to where they were, one to two years ago relative to their peak basically. In every part of our business, they have come down, but are still above where they were pre-pandemic. And again, I think part of that is the mix effect that we talked about in the prior question. There is a mix effect not only across our whole portfolio but even within the segments of our portfolio, we just had more emphasis on the spender side versus the revolver side internally. And so I think you see some of that showing up in the metrics. One other thing I want to say is that talk about your question about minimum payments. So we have simultaneously -- we're sort of seeing an effect where payment rates while they're going down, continue to be well above pre-pandemic levels, even as minimum -- the percentage of customers paying minimum payments. This by the way is not a subprime effect. This is a portfolio effect I'm talking about. The percent of customers paying minimum payments is also somewhat above pre-pandemic levels. Now, it seems a little odd to have both of those effects happening at the same time. But I think in many ways this is a very natural way that normalization is happening. And you've heard us talk for a long time now about what we call the delayed charge-off effect in consumer credit that so many customers got stimulus and forbearance that I think a lot of people who otherwise would have charged off were able to avoid that charge-off. Many, hopefully, we're able to permanently avoid that, but for some, we have believed it was more of a deferral of an inevitability and this phenomenon of delayed charge-offs, which can't be separately measured, we believe is a driving factor behind why credit has been settling out higher than pre-pandemic. Because I think there's just a delayed charge-off effect for some of these customers who otherwise would have charged off earlier. And that then would be consistent with a very healthy consumer payment rates generally even being higher than pre-pandemic, but there is a tail of consumers paying a higher percentage on minimum payments, and some of them going through a charge-off that might have otherwise happened a few years earlier.\nRichard Shane: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good afternoon, Rich. So maybe to ask about marketing. So I think you\u2019re -- the guide that you provided said around $2.6 billion roughly of marketing spend in the second half. And you talked a little bit about the competitive intensity in the top of the market is increasing. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the increase in marketing is being driven by the -- investing more to acquire more customers versus competition pushing up the cost to acquire? And then just given what you just talked about around low end consumers, are you pulling back and else anywhere to cover the increased cost of acquiring?\nRichard Fairbank: Ryan, our -- yeah, our comments about the competitive intensity, let me just elaborate a little bit more about that. The card business is very competitively intense across the spectrum, it's been consistently intense. Competition has -- competition in things like rewards have certainly heated up over the last couple of years. And the thing that I was pointing out is just something that again is not something that is like the realization of the last month or so. It's a phenomenon we've seen from some -- for some time but it is striking which is at the very top of the market. We are seeing for the -- especially a couple of competitors that we have that most intensely play at the very top of the market, you can just absolutely see they are stepping up, investing more in lounges, in experiences, in dining, investing in companies, marketing levels, it's -- I'm sure all the investors can see it. We can all see it and they talk about it. And it's not lost on us that these are strong competitors and we certainly, have -- we already have had very important investment plans in these areas and we note that others are investing heavily too. So, but with respect to the -- let me just now kind of pull up now and just talk about the marketing sort of where we are from a marketing point of view. We continue to see great opportunities and really across our businesses, we remain very excited about the success of our origination activities, especially in our card products and channels and of course, what's happening in the bank. The two big areas that are driven by marketing spend. This continues to be powered by our technology transformation. And just to savor a little bit because we often point at that, why does the technology transformation help here? It gives us the ability to leverage more and more data and machine-learning models to identify the most attractive growth opportunities. And it allows us to increasingly tailor our solutions to -- down to the individual customer level to ensure that we're meeting them right where we are. So kind of the first point I would say and the key reason we're leaning into the marketing is, we are getting a lot of traction and that our tech transformation is certainly helping to power more opportunities. Secondly, we continue to expand on our success in building a franchise at the top of the market and with heavy spenders in this quest, while for years we've been talking about going after the top of the market every year as we get more traction, we reach just a little bit higher. These customers are very attractive. In addition to the obvious spend growth, they generate strong revenue, very low losses, low attrition, and the business helps elevate our brand really across the company. Now it's also something that we've known all along is that it's expensive and requires quite a bit of investment to build a business at the top of the market. In the form of upfront costs and also in the form of a sustained commitment to customer benefits and experiences and building a brand. So, yeah, you have early spend bonuses that are important cost of doing business that shows up in the marketing line item. Brand makes a huge difference and brand of course requires a long-term commitment to build. And as we continue to move up the market, we are moving increasingly into areas where consumers are looking for exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplaces such as -- place such as airport lounges and access to select properties and iconic experiences. So we've seen at the top of the market our two biggest competitors really lean in here. And we -- when we certainly are leaning in as well, Ryan, I wouldn't -- there are some times I've seen over the years that marketing levels just rise and so you just got to market more and more and more just to hold your own. And I don't feel that we're in an environment like this. I feel that the -- certainly competitive intensity is increasing. But when we're talking about in general in the card business where competitive intensity is increasing a bit, and specifically with respect to these investments at the top of the market. These are just important things that we have to build to win at the top of the market, but we are very pleased with the traction we're getting, the economics of our heavy spender business. And so this is -- we just -- it's just not lost on us, a couple of our other competitors are very focused on the same thing. So we continue to lean into growth here, both in terms of upfront customer acquisition and our ongoing investment in brand and exclusive experiences and benefits. Now, let me now turn to the third part of our marketing story, which is our investment in building our national bank. So this has been a journey that we've been on for many, many years. When we bought ING Direct way back in 2012, we said this is going to be not only a great financial acquisition, but it's going to be a transformational strategic acquisition. Because now as a player with a significant branch network and a national direct bank, we have the building blocks to build a unique national bank. And that's what we're building, a digital first national bank. We've got smaller physical branch network. So we lean more on our cafe network, which is in cafes in 21 of the top 25 MSAs. Lean very heavily into our digital experiences and really importantly without a branch on every corner across the United States. The role for Capital One that marketing and brand play in building this national banking business is absolutely a central role. So we are very pleased with the growth that we're getting, the traction, the performance of this business and the opportunity just gets bigger when we think about in the context of the combined entity now joining force with Discover. So these are the compelling opportunities behind our marketing growth and we continue to feel really good about the success and the opportunities in front of us. And that's why we are leaning in very much into the marketing and specifically with respect to the rest of the year, why we pointed to. And of course, virtually every year at Capital One, the second half of the year has quite a bit more marketing than the first half. We pointed to the pattern kind of like what we saw last year in terms of proportional increases in marketing. Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Securities. You may proceed.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on your credit commentary, there had been an expectation among many investors that we would see peak charge-offs somewhere around the second half of this year, given the delinquency trends that you're seeing. Is that a reasonable expectation? And if so, it seems like your credit outlook has derisked somewhat given an improving loss trajectory, but higher reserve rate driven by qualitative factors. Is that a fair thought process? I'll just ask my follow-up as part of this. You mentioned, Andrew, that your capital return is subject to Fed approval, given the pending acquisition. How should we think about the pace of incremental buybacks as we look ahead through rest of the year? Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Yeah. Bill, yeah, let me make a couple of comments on credit. Let me seize a moment in the spirit of Henry Kissinger who says, I hope you have questions for my answers. I -- let me just ask myself a question, so I can answer it because it's going to -- it's set the table for answering your question. Which you may remember last quarter, we pointed at tax refund patterns and said that there may be a new seasonality pattern emerging and it would be too early to call that but it was making it a little bit -- things were not following as closely on a month-by-month basis to some pre-pandemic delinquency patterns that our hypothesis was three months ago that we're seeing a tax refund effect. So let me just talk about that for a second and then Bill, I'll pull up and talk about just sort of what does this mean for sort of how I feel about where we are with respect to credit. So, the -- let's just talk for a second about how seasonality works. We've always seen seasonal credit patterns in our card business and our portfolio trend, they have in generally been more -- they've had more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. I think that's because we have a higher subprime component and those customers are even more linked I think to the seasonal patterns associated with tax refunds, that would be our hypothesis there. Now the second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and Q4 tends to be the seasonal high point for delinquencies. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we believe that tax refunds, again are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February, March time period, which then flows through to lower delinquencies in April and May and then to lower charge-offs. And tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. So the tax code actually new tax withholding rules went into effect way back in 2020. They were passed in 2019, went into effect in 2020, but the pandemic and the normalization since then have kind of swamped seasonality. So we haven't really got -- been able to get a really good read at it -- of it. So we've tended to benchmark to the seasonality of pre-pandemic like 2018 and 2019. But we've now had several more months to look at this pattern and we're seeing a pattern. Well, let me back up. What we've done is what we call de-trending of our credit metrics. So we in hindsight, take the trends out of them to the best we can, so we can see what the net seasonality effects are. And on a detrended basis, last year showed a seasonality with less amplitude on the high side and the low side than had previously been seen pre-pandemic. We assumed that was probably again a manifestation of the new behaviors going in with the new tax refunds. As we now have seen this tax season play out, the seasonality, the payment patterns have been very close to our de-trended 2023 line, so that we believe that we are seeing and it's very plausible, we are seeing a new seasonality. I just want to share that with investors. So later tax refunds and later and lower sort of -- lower the seasonal improvement in delinquencies. But we think the seasonal increase in delinquencies that we see in the back half of the year, likely will also be less pronounced going forward than it has been in the past. All of this by the way happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster, more concentrated way. So we -- what we see, we felt it was a little bit noisy. Last quarter when we were talking to you, we were finding each quarter things were coming in a little bit. I mean, the second derivative was still doing great things. But relative to our sort of close in expectations based on seasonality, things were a little bit off. With the revised seasonality, what we see is things very nicely settling out in card credit. And we feel very good about the last couple of months that came in relative to that new seasonality curve. So I think settling out is the real word from here. Given that from -- but to your question about peak, we're not really going to -- we're not giving really forward guidance about declarations at peak. But from a seasonal point of view, things should head down from here in Q3, and then sort of pop up around October. October is often a month, we tend to get just a little bit of an October surprise, so we'll keep an eye on that. But the other thing I just want to say about credit is our recoveries inventory is starting to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then other than the economy, I think the other real factor that's going to drive credit performance for us and other issuers in the next couple of years will be, what is the size of this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. Thank you.\nAndrew Young: Okay. And then, Bill, well, with respect to the derisk comment, Rich just provide a lot of color on our view of losses. I would just say, given the accounting rules, we forecast losses under a variety of scenarios and use qualitative factors for uncertainties around that. And I would say, therefore, like we are appropriately reserved for all of that. With respect to your question around repurchases, I'll just note, our agreement with Discover doesn't prohibit us from buying shares. The only restriction is that we'll need to be out of the market during the S-4 proxy vote period. However, we are not operating under the SCB. As I said in my prepared remarks and we laid out in the last Q, the announcement of the intention to acquire Discover did constitute a material business change. And therefore, like we did in this recent quarter, in the second quarter, we're subject to Fed pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. And so that's what's going to dictate the pace at which we repurchase until that process has concluded.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nDon Fandetti: Yes. Rich, can you talk a bit about how you're seeing loan growth in auto? And also as banks potentially come back in, are you seeing or worried about spread or yield compression on new originations?\nRichard Fairbank: So, hey, Don, it's an interesting thing. We always seem to zag while others -- zig while others zag in the auto business. As we discussed in the last quarter, we have an optimistic outlook on the auto business. We're seeing a lot of success in the auto business and our investments in infrastructure are also reaping a lot of benefits for us. So just on the numbers, our originations grew 21% versus last year in Q1 and the trend continues in Q2 with 18% growth on the year-over-year quarter. And the loss performance has normalized and it's stable. We -- very importantly, we made -- intervened and made an adjustment for what we felt was credit score inflation that was happening during the pandemic. And so we pulled back in '22 and '23 by just in a sense, worsening the otherwise scores one would see under a belief that they were artificially inflated. And that enabled our vintages all through this period of time, '22, '23, and all through the normalization to perform very well. We like the economics of the loans were originated and we're very satisfied with the performance of the overall portfolio. So when we think about the headwinds in the business, interest rates remain high. And of course, that along with high vehicle values continues to pressure affordability. And auto, used car prices, which are still high relative to historical standards, they are probably in a position to gradually be coming down. So we'll have to keep an eye on that. For a long time, we were concerned about the margins in the business because competitors had not passed through higher interest rates into the cost of the auto loans. We pulled back quite a bit, Don, as you remember during that period of time. We have seen those margins basically return to where they were. So I think that's a pretty good sign there. So all things considered, with a watchful eye on used car values, we are seeing enhanced opportunities in the auto business with margins that have a good resilience to them and quite a bit improved relative to the period where we were raising the alarm bells a bit about what was happening to the effective resilience in that business. Thank you.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nRichard Fairbank: Thank you.\nJeff Norris: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our final question this evening comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. When you talked about the increase in the reserve rate, not the dollars or the reserve, not the Walmart piece, but the reserve rate itself. Andrew, you didn't mention like mix of receivables. Is it -- has there been any shift towards mass market or subprime from super prime within the card business?\nAndrew Young: Not in any material way that would have a significant impact on the allowance, Moshe.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, Rich, given what's happened with Walmart and the pending Discover acquisition, could you talk a little about your thoughts on the partner or private label business kind of in the current environment? Like what are your thoughts now in terms of your existing contracts and the tendency to want to get new ones or any thoughts on that in this environment?\nRichard Fairbank: So, thank you. I think the -- well, the Walmart partnership is a very unique one, that I think there is not a lot to extrapolate to other partners on that. I think we've ended up in a situation there where we -- the loss share was a very good thing. So we're going to be carrying around loss rates that are something on the order of 40 basis points higher on our portfolio for that. So we'll have to just make sure we all see that, but we've got the full economics on the business increasingly that portfolio -- the portfolio we inherited is now very seasoned and the rest of it is the portfolio we ourselves originated. So we know it well. And I think that we feel very good about that. So the partnership business is a very partner-by-partner business. I think where people get into trouble is feeling they've got to drive to a certain scale. We all know scale matters in the credit card business and scale matters in the partnership business. But here's the thing, we have certainly learned over time how unique or how individual different partnerships are. And we've seen great ones, we've seen not so great ones. Here is Moshe, what we -- if I pull up on the patterns of what we most look for. It's first of all a healthy franchise, a company that is itself healthy and that's certainly a good sign. Now the credit card business does have a pretty good default structure whereby if a partner runs into trouble and can't continue, we inherit the portfolio, which now Walmart of course is a very strong company, but we're -- here's an example of inheriting a portfolio, where I think things are going to continue very successfully there. But the other thing that we really look for is what is the reason that the partner is driving this either co-brand or private-label business. Is it to -- is the -- on one end of a continuum is it\u2019s the sheer quest for profits? And on the other end of the continuum, it is having the card partnership at the -- as a centerpiece in driving a franchise. And the behaviors that a partner has, the incentives that get baked into programs, they tend to be very driven by where on that continuum one is. We've walked away from a lot of opportunities over the years where things were just too focused on the card partnership as sort of the means to drive profit for the partner at more so than a way to really build a franchise. But those are some of the patterns, there are always exceptions to every rules -- for every rule. But -- so we're still very much a believer in the card partnership business, but the key is, we're going to be selective and never knowing that it's an auction based business, that's the other thing. One has to really be willing to walk away when the price is right. So with that, those are my thoughts, Moshe.\nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich, and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today. Thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows second quarter results in our credit card business. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. In the second quarter, our domestic card business delivered another quarter of strong results as we continued to invest in flagship products and exceptional customer experiences to grow our franchise. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the quarter was 5%. Ending loan balances increased $11.1 billion or about 8% year-over-year. Average loans also increased about 8% and second quarter revenue was up 9%, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin for the quarter remained strong at 17.9%. The revenue margin includes a positive impact of about 18 basis points resulting from the partial quarter effect of the end of the Walmart revenue sharing agreement. The charge-off rate for the quarter was 6.05%. The partial quarter impact of the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement increased the quarterly charge-off rate by 19 basis points. Excluding this impact, the charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 5.86%, up 148 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 4.14%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. As a reminder, the end of the Walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rates. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the second quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate excluding the Walmart impact was down 8 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 34 basis points. Domestic card non-interest expense was up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher marketing expense. Total company marketing expense in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business. Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the marketplace, higher media spend, and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences, like our travel portal, airport lounges, and Capital One Shopping. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. After returning to positive growth last quarter, auto originations were up 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. Consumer banking ending loans were down $1.6 billion or 2% year-over-year and average loans were down 3%. On a linked quarter basis, ending loans were up 1% and average loans were flat. Compared to the year ago quarter, ending consumer deposits were up about 7% and average deposits were up 5%. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about 9% year-over-year, largely driven by higher deposit costs and lower average loans compared to the prior year quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.81%, up 41 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 5.67%, up 29 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in 2022, auto charge-offs have been strong and stable. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 6% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 3%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter and non-interest expense was lower by about 6%. The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the second quarter increased 2 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.15%. The commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.62%, up 23 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 18 basis points to 1.46%. In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter. We delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans, purchase volume, and revenue and a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in auto originations. Consumer credit trends continued to show stability and our operating efficiency ratio improved. We had guided to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustment to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023, assuming the CFPB late fee rule takes effect in October. And we're on a very consistent path with what we expected when we gave that guidance. If the implementation of the rule is delayed, that would be a tailwind to 2024 annual operating efficiency ratio. One thing that has changed is the Walmart relationship. Our partnership ended in the second quarter, which will increase charge-off rates, but have a positive impact on operating efficiency ratio. Including the Walmart impact, we expect full year 2024 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to 2023. We continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise. In the domestic card business, we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels and our origination opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation, which enables us to leverage machine learning at scale to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and customize our marketing offers. We are also getting traction in building our franchise at the top of the market with heavy spenders. It is not lost on us that competitive intensity and marketing levels are increasing at the very top of the market and we know we have important investments to make. We continue to be pleased to see our investments pay-off in customer and spend growth and returns. And we're building and enduring franchise with annuity like revenue streams, very low losses, and very low attrition. In consumer banking, our modern technology and leading digital capabilities are powering our digital first national banking strategy, and we're leaning even harder into marketing to grow our national checking franchise, which has had industry leading pricing with no fees and industry leading customer satisfaction. Pulling up, marketing is a key driver of current and future growth and value creation across the company and we're leaning hard into our marketing investments. We expect total company marketing in the second half of 2024 to be meaningfully higher than the first half, similar to the pattern we saw last year. We are all-in and working hard to complete the Discover acquisition. Our applications for regulatory approval are in process and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. We continue to expect that we'll be in a position to complete the acquisition late this year or early next year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payments network positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform, and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses, and consumers and driving enhanced network growth. In credit cards and consumer banking, we're bringing together proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer. And we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 year technology transformation across every business and the network. Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands, and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Sanjay, I think what we see is something that's very stable. The U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy. Of course, the labor market remains strikingly resilient. Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards despite high interest rates. When we look at our customers, we see that on average, they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels. On the other hand, inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and we've only recently seen real wage growth turn positive again. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class, mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. So we'll obviously keep an eye on that. And I think at the margin, these effects are almost certainly stretching some consumers financially. But on the whole, I think I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative to most historical benchmarks. And as our credit numbers came in five months [Technical Difficulty] I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Can you still hear me? You can hear me, okay? I just had some cross message coming in on my phone. But with respect to credit, we were very pleased with the credit performance in the quarter. We had talked a bit about the seasonality, maybe people want to ask question about that, but we saw basically pulling up, we see things settling out nicely in the card business and there things are very strong in the auto business. Sure, Mihir. Like, what we've seen at least within our walls and you saw it as evidence of it this quarter in a quarter where seasonally you typically see a decline in deposit balances. Looking at H8 (ph) data, we saw a few -- I think it was $4 billion of growth. We've been quite pleased over the course of the last couple of years with all of the investments we've made over many years in building a deposit franchise and are certainly benefiting from that. And so with respect to the beta going forward, first, looking at what we saw in the upcycle here in the total cumulative beta that we've seen in this cycle this quarter, I think cumulatively it was 62% and so assuming that the Fed's next move is to bring rates down. It's hard to precisely predict what's going to happen to deposit costs and therefore betas, and in particular, the pace of those declines because market dynamics, competitive pricing actions, other actions related to companies looking to potentially preserve NIM, that's going to drive betas in the future cycle. But I think you get a pretty good sense for our pricing and mix based on what you saw in the upcycle and within that backdrop that I just described, that's going to influence what happens to our beta on the way down. Yes. Well, thank you so much. Just with respect to spending, we see pretty proportional movements in discretionary versus non-discretionary spending, nothing really striking there when we look at the portfolio spending metrics. The spend per customer is really pretty flat. When you see spend growth at a company like Capital One, the purchase volume growth is really being driven by the new accounts. So things are really pretty stable, flat and stable, healthy, but pretty flat on a per-customer basis. With respect to the question about the gradual transition of our portfolio to a higher end customer, let me just pull up and talk about that. We have for decades been a company that sort of serves the mass market really from the top of the credit spectrum through to even down to some subprime customers. And we have continued very consistently with this strategy, probably the most striking thing though that's happened over the last 10 or 14 years, I guess, 14 years ago is when we launched the Venture Card. We have systematically leaned into going after the top of the market, not leaving the other behind, but really as an additive strategy. And we have continued through our marketing and through the products that we're offering to just keep moving higher and higher in terms of the target customers and the traction that we're getting. And by the way, we continue even as we're growing purchase volume overall, where we see the highest growth rates in purchase volume are as we go higher in the market. So we're very happy about that. And when we think about the portfolio effects that happened there, this is one thing that we see is that payment rates have along that journey gone up quite a bit at Capital One. And when we look to see our payment rates coming back to where they were pre-pandemic, they sort of -- they probably just aren't going to return all the way because that would be a reflection of the portfolio shift. We just in general have had the kind of mix shift that you'd expect with higher payment rates and a -- just higher levels of spend, higher spend rates in the business and that's been very successful. So -- but from an outstanding's point of view, it doesn't -- the top of the market business doesn't have that much impact on outstandings because these folks generally pay in full. So when you see the outstandings movements of Capital One, it's pretty consistently driven by the mass market part of our business. It's just that inside some of the portfolio, metrics are moving because of the mix shift toward more spenders. Yeah. Okay. So let's just pull up for a minute on just talking about how the subprime consumer is holding up. So, way back in the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions. Subprime, also worsened less on a percentage basis than prime, but of course, it -- in absolute delta, it still moved more. In the pandemic, subprime credit moved more and more quickly than prime. It normalized more quickly and appears to be stable and appeared basically to stabilize sooner as well. And that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and forbearance on financial products and then the unwinding of that over time. And so subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they're correlated and we saw these effects across credit both in talking about the credit spectrum and also the income gradients. So on the other hand, just a couple of other effects just on the credit side that have happened over the recent years. Subprime consumers have been subject to more industry credit supply, including fintech competition during and after the pandemic. So that's been something we've always kept a close eye on and worried about whether that was going to disproportionately impact the credit performance of subprime for customers. I don't really -- I mean, given the overall pretty strong performance in subprime, I think we haven't seen that effect too much. And another thing to point out is that income growth has been consistently higher for lower income consumers over the past several years and this is the opposite of what we saw during and after the global financial crisis. But while no two cycles alike -- are alike, I think again we're seeing that subprime consumers and lower income consumers again they're not the same thing, but they tend to move earlier, but not necessarily more than the overall market. Now when you -- let's talk a little bit about payment rates. So throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increased not only for us but across the industry. And more recently payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs as the effects of stimulus have waned. And the payment rates generally we have seen this effect, so the effect that we've seen of payment rates going down relative to where they were, one to two years ago relative to their peak basically. In every part of our business, they have come down, but are still above where they were pre-pandemic. And again, I think part of that is the mix effect that we talked about in the prior question. There is a mix effect not only across our whole portfolio but even within the segments of our portfolio, we just had more emphasis on the spender side versus the revolver side internally. And so I think you see some of that showing up in the metrics. One other thing I want to say is that talk about your question about minimum payments. So we have simultaneously -- we're sort of seeing an effect where payment rates while they're going down, continue to be well above pre-pandemic levels, even as minimum -- the percentage of customers paying minimum payments. This by the way is not a subprime effect. This is a portfolio effect I'm talking about. The percent of customers paying minimum payments is also somewhat above pre-pandemic levels. Now, it seems a little odd to have both of those effects happening at the same time. But I think in many ways this is a very natural way that normalization is happening. And you've heard us talk for a long time now about what we call the delayed charge-off effect in consumer credit that so many customers got stimulus and forbearance that I think a lot of people who otherwise would have charged off were able to avoid that charge-off. Many, hopefully, we're able to permanently avoid that, but for some, we have believed it was more of a deferral of an inevitability and this phenomenon of delayed charge-offs, which can't be separately measured, we believe is a driving factor behind why credit has been settling out higher than pre-pandemic. Because I think there's just a delayed charge-off effect for some of these customers who otherwise would have charged off earlier. And that then would be consistent with a very healthy consumer payment rates generally even being higher than pre-pandemic, but there is a tail of consumers paying a higher percentage on minimum payments, and some of them going through a charge-off that might have otherwise happened a few years earlier. Ryan, our -- yeah, our comments about the competitive intensity, let me just elaborate a little bit more about that. The card business is very competitively intense across the spectrum, it's been consistently intense. Competition has -- competition in things like rewards have certainly heated up over the last couple of years. And the thing that I was pointing out is just something that again is not something that is like the realization of the last month or so. It's a phenomenon we've seen from some -- for some time but it is striking which is at the very top of the market. We are seeing for the -- especially a couple of competitors that we have that most intensely play at the very top of the market, you can just absolutely see they are stepping up, investing more in lounges, in experiences, in dining, investing in companies, marketing levels, it's -- I'm sure all the investors can see it. We can all see it and they talk about it. And it's not lost on us that these are strong competitors and we certainly, have -- we already have had very important investment plans in these areas and we note that others are investing heavily too. So, but with respect to the -- let me just now kind of pull up now and just talk about the marketing sort of where we are from a marketing point of view. We continue to see great opportunities and really across our businesses, we remain very excited about the success of our origination activities, especially in our card products and channels and of course, what's happening in the bank. The two big areas that are driven by marketing spend. This continues to be powered by our technology transformation. And just to savor a little bit because we often point at that, why does the technology transformation help here? It gives us the ability to leverage more and more data and machine-learning models to identify the most attractive growth opportunities. And it allows us to increasingly tailor our solutions to -- down to the individual customer level to ensure that we're meeting them right where we are. So kind of the first point I would say and the key reason we're leaning into the marketing is, we are getting a lot of traction and that our tech transformation is certainly helping to power more opportunities. Secondly, we continue to expand on our success in building a franchise at the top of the market and with heavy spenders in this quest, while for years we've been talking about going after the top of the market every year as we get more traction, we reach just a little bit higher. These customers are very attractive. In addition to the obvious spend growth, they generate strong revenue, very low losses, low attrition, and the business helps elevate our brand really across the company. Now it's also something that we've known all along is that it's expensive and requires quite a bit of investment to build a business at the top of the market. In the form of upfront costs and also in the form of a sustained commitment to customer benefits and experiences and building a brand. So, yeah, you have early spend bonuses that are important cost of doing business that shows up in the marketing line item. Brand makes a huge difference and brand of course requires a long-term commitment to build. And as we continue to move up the market, we are moving increasingly into areas where consumers are looking for exclusive services and experiences that aren't available in the general marketplaces such as -- place such as airport lounges and access to select properties and iconic experiences. So we've seen at the top of the market our two biggest competitors really lean in here. And we -- when we certainly are leaning in as well, Ryan, I wouldn't -- there are some times I've seen over the years that marketing levels just rise and so you just got to market more and more and more just to hold your own. And I don't feel that we're in an environment like this. I feel that the -- certainly competitive intensity is increasing. But when we're talking about in general in the card business where competitive intensity is increasing a bit, and specifically with respect to these investments at the top of the market. These are just important things that we have to build to win at the top of the market, but we are very pleased with the traction we're getting, the economics of our heavy spender business. And so this is -- we just -- it's just not lost on us, a couple of our other competitors are very focused on the same thing. So we continue to lean into growth here, both in terms of upfront customer acquisition and our ongoing investment in brand and exclusive experiences and benefits. Now, let me now turn to the third part of our marketing story, which is our investment in building our national bank. So this has been a journey that we've been on for many, many years. When we bought ING Direct way back in 2012, we said this is going to be not only a great financial acquisition, but it's going to be a transformational strategic acquisition. Because now as a player with a significant branch network and a national direct bank, we have the building blocks to build a unique national bank. And that's what we're building, a digital first national bank. We've got smaller physical branch network. So we lean more on our cafe network, which is in cafes in 21 of the top 25 MSAs. Lean very heavily into our digital experiences and really importantly without a branch on every corner across the United States. The role for Capital One that marketing and brand play in building this national banking business is absolutely a central role. So we are very pleased with the growth that we're getting, the traction, the performance of this business and the opportunity just gets bigger when we think about in the context of the combined entity now joining force with Discover. So these are the compelling opportunities behind our marketing growth and we continue to feel really good about the success and the opportunities in front of us. And that's why we are leaning in very much into the marketing and specifically with respect to the rest of the year, why we pointed to. And of course, virtually every year at Capital One, the second half of the year has quite a bit more marketing than the first half. We pointed to the pattern kind of like what we saw last year in terms of proportional increases in marketing. Thanks, Ryan. Yeah. Bill, yeah, let me make a couple of comments on credit. Let me seize a moment in the spirit of Henry Kissinger who says, I hope you have questions for my answers. I -- let me just ask myself a question, so I can answer it because it's going to -- it's set the table for answering your question. Which you may remember last quarter, we pointed at tax refund patterns and said that there may be a new seasonality pattern emerging and it would be too early to call that but it was making it a little bit -- things were not following as closely on a month-by-month basis to some pre-pandemic delinquency patterns that our hypothesis was three months ago that we're seeing a tax refund effect. So let me just talk about that for a second and then Bill, I'll pull up and talk about just sort of what does this mean for sort of how I feel about where we are with respect to credit. So, the -- let's just talk for a second about how seasonality works. We've always seen seasonal credit patterns in our card business and our portfolio trend, they have in generally been more -- they've had more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average. I think that's because we have a higher subprime component and those customers are even more linked I think to the seasonal patterns associated with tax refunds, that would be our hypothesis there. Now the second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and Q4 tends to be the seasonal high point for delinquencies. Card losses lag relative to delinquencies, the losses tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter. Now, we believe that tax refunds, again are a significant driver of these seasonal trends. And tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the February, March time period, which then flows through to lower delinquencies in April and May and then to lower charge-offs. And tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries. So the tax code actually new tax withholding rules went into effect way back in 2020. They were passed in 2019, went into effect in 2020, but the pandemic and the normalization since then have kind of swamped seasonality. So we haven't really got -- been able to get a really good read at it -- of it. So we've tended to benchmark to the seasonality of pre-pandemic like 2018 and 2019. But we've now had several more months to look at this pattern and we're seeing a pattern. Well, let me back up. What we've done is what we call de-trending of our credit metrics. So we in hindsight, take the trends out of them to the best we can, so we can see what the net seasonality effects are. And on a detrended basis, last year showed a seasonality with less amplitude on the high side and the low side than had previously been seen pre-pandemic. We assumed that was probably again a manifestation of the new behaviors going in with the new tax refunds. As we now have seen this tax season play out, the seasonality, the payment patterns have been very close to our de-trended 2023 line, so that we believe that we are seeing and it's very plausible, we are seeing a new seasonality. I just want to share that with investors. So later tax refunds and later and lower sort of -- lower the seasonal improvement in delinquencies. But we think the seasonal increase in delinquencies that we see in the back half of the year, likely will also be less pronounced going forward than it has been in the past. All of this by the way happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster, more concentrated way. So we -- what we see, we felt it was a little bit noisy. Last quarter when we were talking to you, we were finding each quarter things were coming in a little bit. I mean, the second derivative was still doing great things. But relative to our sort of close in expectations based on seasonality, things were a little bit off. With the revised seasonality, what we see is things very nicely settling out in card credit. And we feel very good about the last couple of months that came in relative to that new seasonality curve. So I think settling out is the real word from here. Given that from -- but to your question about peak, we're not really going to -- we're not giving really forward guidance about declarations at peak. But from a seasonal point of view, things should head down from here in Q3, and then sort of pop up around October. October is often a month, we tend to get just a little bit of an October surprise, so we'll keep an eye on that. But the other thing I just want to say about credit is our recoveries inventory is starting to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time, all else being equal. And then other than the economy, I think the other real factor that's going to drive credit performance for us and other issuers in the next couple of years will be, what is the size of this delayed charge-off effect from the pandemic. Thank you. So, hey, Don, it's an interesting thing. We always seem to zag while others -- zig while others zag in the auto business. As we discussed in the last quarter, we have an optimistic outlook on the auto business. We're seeing a lot of success in the auto business and our investments in infrastructure are also reaping a lot of benefits for us. So just on the numbers, our originations grew 21% versus last year in Q1 and the trend continues in Q2 with 18% growth on the year-over-year quarter. And the loss performance has normalized and it's stable. We -- very importantly, we made -- intervened and made an adjustment for what we felt was credit score inflation that was happening during the pandemic. And so we pulled back in '22 and '23 by just in a sense, worsening the otherwise scores one would see under a belief that they were artificially inflated. And that enabled our vintages all through this period of time, '22, '23, and all through the normalization to perform very well. We like the economics of the loans were originated and we're very satisfied with the performance of the overall portfolio. So when we think about the headwinds in the business, interest rates remain high. And of course, that along with high vehicle values continues to pressure affordability. And auto, used car prices, which are still high relative to historical standards, they are probably in a position to gradually be coming down. So we'll have to keep an eye on that. For a long time, we were concerned about the margins in the business because competitors had not passed through higher interest rates into the cost of the auto loans. We pulled back quite a bit, Don, as you remember during that period of time. We have seen those margins basically return to where they were. So I think that's a pretty good sign there. So all things considered, with a watchful eye on used car values, we are seeing enhanced opportunities in the auto business with margins that have a good resilience to them and quite a bit improved relative to the period where we were raising the alarm bells a bit about what was happening to the effective resilience in that business. Thank you. Thank you. So, thank you. I think the -- well, the Walmart partnership is a very unique one, that I think there is not a lot to extrapolate to other partners on that. I think we've ended up in a situation there where we -- the loss share was a very good thing. So we're going to be carrying around loss rates that are something on the order of 40 basis points higher on our portfolio for that. So we'll have to just make sure we all see that, but we've got the full economics on the business increasingly that portfolio -- the portfolio we inherited is now very seasoned and the rest of it is the portfolio we ourselves originated. So we know it well. And I think that we feel very good about that. So the partnership business is a very partner-by-partner business. I think where people get into trouble is feeling they've got to drive to a certain scale. We all know scale matters in the credit card business and scale matters in the partnership business. But here's the thing, we have certainly learned over time how unique or how individual different partnerships are. And we've seen great ones, we've seen not so great ones. Here is Moshe, what we -- if I pull up on the patterns of what we most look for. It's first of all a healthy franchise, a company that is itself healthy and that's certainly a good sign. Now the credit card business does have a pretty good default structure whereby if a partner runs into trouble and can't continue, we inherit the portfolio, which now Walmart of course is a very strong company, but we're -- here's an example of inheriting a portfolio, where I think things are going to continue very successfully there. But the other thing that we really look for is what is the reason that the partner is driving this either co-brand or private-label business. Is it to -- is the -- on one end of a continuum is it's the sheer quest for profits? And on the other end of the continuum, it is having the card partnership at the -- as a centerpiece in driving a franchise. And the behaviors that a partner has, the incentives that get baked into programs, they tend to be very driven by where on that continuum one is. We've walked away from a lot of opportunities over the years where things were just too focused on the card partnership as sort of the means to drive profit for the partner at more so than a way to really build a franchise. But those are some of the patterns, there are always exceptions to every rules -- for every rule. But -- so we're still very much a believer in the card partnership business, but the key is, we're going to be selective and never knowing that it's an auction based business, that's the other thing. One has to really be willing to walk away when the price is right. So with that, those are my thoughts, Moshe."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $597 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to the Walmart partnership termination, Discover integration costs, and an accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC's special assessment. Net of these adjusting items, second quarter earnings per share were $3.14. Relative to the prior quarter, period end loans held for investment increased 1%, while average loans were flat. Ending deposits were flat versus last quarter, while average deposits increased 1%. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits increased 1 percentage point to 83% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the second quarter increased 7% from the first quarter. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1%, driven by higher net and non-interest income, while non-interest expense decreased 4%, driven by a decline in operating expense. Our provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion in the quarter. The $1.2 billion increase in provision relative to the prior quarter was almost entirely driven by higher allowance. Included in the second quarter was an $826 million allowance built from the elimination of the loss sharing provisions that occurred within the termination of the Walmart partnership. The remaining quarter-over-quarter provision increase was driven by a $353 million higher net reserve build and a $28 million increase in net charge-offs. Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $1.3 billion in allowance this quarter. The allowance balance now stands at $16.6 billion. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 35 basis points to 5.23%. The increase in this quarter's allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by a build in our card segment. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our domestic card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 69 basis points to 8.54%. The substantial majority of the increase in coverage was driven by the impact of the termination of the Walmart loss sharing agreement. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance decreased by $23 million, resulting in a 5 basis point decrease to the coverage ratio. And finally, our commercial banking allowance increased by $6 million. Coverage ratio remained essentially flat at 1.74%. Turning to Page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased about $5 billion to approximately $123 billion. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $45 billion, down about $6 billion from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by wholesale funding maturities, loan growth, and declines in our commercial deposits, partially offset by deposit growth in our retail banking business. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 155%, down from 164% in the first quarter. Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.7%, 1 basis point higher than last quarter and 22 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The relatively flat quarter-over-quarter NIM was the result of largely offsetting factors. NIM in the quarter benefited from the termination of the revenue sharing agreement with Walmart as well as modestly higher yields in the auto business. These two factors were roughly offset by the seasonal effects on yield in the card portfolio and a slight increase in the rate paid on retail deposits. Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.2%, 10 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was largely offset by the impact of dividends and $150 million of share repurchases. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is 5.5%, resulting in a CET1 requirement of 10%. However, as we disclosed in our last 10-Q, the announcement of the acquisition of Discover constituted a material business change. As a result, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Sure, Sanjay. Well, let me start by covering this quarter's allowance and then I'll talk about the future. So in the quarter, as you said, first, we had the effect of Walmart, the $826 million build that we spelled out as an adjusting item. We also reserved for the growth we saw in the quarter. Beyond that coverage in card, as you referenced, grew, I think it was just over 10 basis points, which is a little over 1% of the allowance balance. And so, as part of that process each quarter, not only are we rolling forward our baseline forecast, but we're also looking at a range of macroeconomic and consumer behavior uncertainties, including things like the changing seasonal customer behavior we talked about last quarter. And so as a result, in this quarter, we increased the qualitative factors to reflect those uncertainties and that's what drove the modest increase in coverage this quarter. As I look ahead and talking conceptually here, but in a period where projected loss rates in future quarters are projected to stabilize and ultimately decline and might indicate a decline in the coverage ratio, I would say, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat for some period of time as we incorporate the uncertainty of those future projections into the allowance. And in a period where forecasted losses are rising, we're quick to incorporate those higher forecasted losses and also potentially add qualitative factors for uncertainty like you saw early in the pandemic, but I would say it is unlikely to be symmetric on the way down. And so eventually, the projected stabilizing and ultimately lower losses will flow through the allowance, particularly as the uncertainties around that forecast become more certain. But at this point, I'm not going to be in the business of forecasting when that's actually going to take place for us. Okay. And then, Bill, well, with respect to the derisk comment, Rich just provide a lot of color on our view of losses. I would just say, given the accounting rules, we forecast losses under a variety of scenarios and use qualitative factors for uncertainties around that. And I would say, therefore, like we are appropriately reserved for all of that. With respect to your question around repurchases, I'll just note, our agreement with Discover doesn't prohibit us from buying shares. The only restriction is that we'll need to be out of the market during the S-4 proxy vote period. However, we are not operating under the SCB. As I said in my prepared remarks and we laid out in the last Q, the announcement of the intention to acquire Discover did constitute a material business change. And therefore, like we did in this recent quarter, in the second quarter, we're subject to Fed pre-approval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded. And so that's what's going to dictate the pace at which we repurchase until that process has concluded. Not in any material way that would have a significant impact on the allowance, Moshe."

I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $3.13 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $42 million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC special assessment.\n Net of this adjusting item, first quarter earnings per share were $3.21. Relative to the prior quarter, period-end loans held for investment decreased 2% and  period-end deposits increased 1%. Both average loans and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits remained at 82% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the first quarter increased 13% from the fourth quarter or 6% adjusting for the impacts of FDIC special assessments in both quarters.\n Revenue in the linked quarter declined 1%, largely driven by lower noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 6% on an adjusted basis, driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by $57 million lower net reserve build, partially offset by an $83 million increase in net charge-offs.\n Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $91 million in allowance this quarter, bringing the balance to $15.4 billion, an increase of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our Auto and Domestic Card portfolios. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 11 basis points to 4.88%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5.\n Our baseline economic forecast modestly improved this quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter, which generally aligns with consensus. We continue to consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 22 basis points to 7.85%. The increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarter's seasonal outstandings.\n In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance increased by $46 million, resulting in a 7 basis point increase to the coverage ratio. The allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the Auto Finance business. And finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $7 million, primarily driven by portfolio contraction. Coverage ratio increased by 1 basis point to 1.72%. \n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to $127 billion, about $7 billion higher than last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $51 billion, up about $8 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the seasonality of our card balances. Our average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and well above regulatory minimums at 164%. \n Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 4 basis points lower than last order and 9 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NIM was largely driven by the impact of having 1 fewer day in the quarter. Modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter.\n Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets more than offset the impact of CECL phase in dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $100 million of shares in the first quarter. Our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the Discover transaction.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? \nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows first quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the Domestic Card business remained strong in the first quarter. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the first quarter was 6%. \n Ending loan balances increased $12.9 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Average loans increased 11%, and first quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 5.94%, about 18% above its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 82 basis points from the prior year to 4.48%. \n On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 59 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 13 basis points. The linked-quarter delinquency and charge-off rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from normal seasonality. We believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far in 2024, relative to what we've historically observed.\n Tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality. Each year, they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in February.  Our portfolio trends generally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average. Last quarter, our view was that the charge-off rate was settling out about 15% above 2019 levels in the near term. That was based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over 3 to 6 months, and that was the horizon of our estimate.\n If the trend of lower tax refunds sustains, it could raise the level of charge-off somewhat in the near term but this does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019. The continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends sometimes referred to as the improving second derivative supports our view.  The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the first quarter.\n Domestic Card noninterest expense was up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1 billion for the quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Total company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our Domestic Card and Consumer Banking businesses and builds and leverages the value of our brand. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation.\n Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic Card business. And in the first quarter, Domestic Card marketing also included higher early spend businesses driven by strong new account growth, higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise.  \n As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks.\n Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, Auto originations increased 21% from the prior year quarter, a return to growth after several quarters of year-over-year declines. Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $3.1 billion or 4% year-over-year, on a linked quarter basis ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another quarter of year-over-year growth in consumer deposits. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up just under $10 billion or 3% year-over-year.\n Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter, powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 13% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs.\n Noninterest expense was down about 3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The Auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.99%,  up 46 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.28%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 20 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 106 basis points. The linked-quarter charge-off rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical seasonal patterns we've historically observed driven by the tax refund trends I just discussed. Even with the tax refund effects, auto credit performance remains strong.\n Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 8%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. First quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up about 6%. \n The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the first quarter decreased 40 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.13%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.39%  down 42 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 44 basis points to 1.28%.  Commercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of total company loan balances.\n In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter. We posted another quarter of top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. Domestic Card credit trends continue to stabilize and Auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We grew consumer deposits and we added liquidity and maintain capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology, and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time.\n For the full year 2024, we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023.  Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming the rule takes effect in October 2024. The timing of the new rule remains uncertain. If the rule were to take effect at an earlier date, it would be a headwind to the 2024 operating efficiency ratio.\n Of course, the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discover. We've submitted our application for regulatory approval and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payment  position Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of Credit Card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses and consumers and driving enhanced network growth.\n In the Credit Card business, we're bringing together 2 proven franchises with complementary strategy and a shared focus on the customer. And we can accelerate the growth of our national digital first consumer banking business by adding the Discover's consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debt network.\n We will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 years transformation across every business and the network, which will serve as the catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk management and compliance underwriting marketing and customer service.\n Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create Consumer Banking and global payments platform with unique capability, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and it offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers, and an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term.\n And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? \nJeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start Q&A session there. [Operator Instructions] \n Josh, please start the Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: So Rich, maybe just start off on credit.  It sounds like you're running a little bit ahead of what you had outlined in the last quarter. But when you put aside the time the tax refund, maybe just talk about what you're seeing from the consumer? And do you think we've now reached the inflection where we can more closely follow seasonal patterns? And once the noise settles, do you think we're kind of back at that 15% level that you had outlined? \nRichard Fairbank: Thank you, Ryan. Look, I think that the story continues to be one of -- well, in terms of -- there's sort of the consumer itself. Let's just talk about the consumer for a second and then let's talk about Capital One's credit performance but just the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the economy. The labor market remains strikingly resilient.  Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards. And when we look at our customers, we see that they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic, and this is true across income levels.\n On the other hand, of course, inflation shrank real incomes for almost 2 years. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. And I think at the margin, these effects stretch some consumers financially. So -- but on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative -- pretty strong shape relative to historical benchmarks. So in terms of Capital One's performance, we continue to see a settling out. We consider -- we believe that for Capital One, I can't speak for all card issuers but we definitely have seen what we think is sort of a landing.\n And our -- so we feel very good about where the credit is. The point that I wanted to make about the tax refunds, let's just pull up for a second on that. The tax refunds are something that nobody knows for sure exactly what's behind seasonality but I think it's a -- we believe, a very important driver of seasonality. It's a bigger effect for us than other players because I think cash refunds just play a little bit bigger role in -- collectively across our customer base.\n So the tax refunds in the very near-term effect credit performance, Ryan, what you're referring to the 15% guidance that we gave, that was not an annual guidance number that was saying, if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of delinquencies and delinquency roll rates. That's where we would see charge-offs, and charge-offs tend to be higher in the first half of the year. So what we're doing is giving a window to the higher part of charge-offs for the year, and we were saying they were settling out looked like around 15% above 2019 levels.\n Part of that -- and so basically, what I'm saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the seasonality effect. As we can see in the government data, tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns. And so that affects our near-term credit performance. And actually, we often talk about, well, isn't the 6-month window basically once charge-offs start bubbling and going through the roll rate buckets we can pretty much see where charge-offs are going. Tax refunds actually affect the payment rates in every bucket.\n So our point was in the very near term, it actually leads to a bit of a higher charge-off rate than we had guided to over that near window. But that doesn't change our view that credit has settled out but the 15% was not a guidance for the year. We haven't really given credit guidance for the year. What we're really saying is we have seen credit settle out but we wanted to just flag that both in the Credit Card business and in our Auto business while credit continues to be very strong, and you've seen things like really improving delinquencies, we just wanted to point out that in the very near term, relative to what we have seen in terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds, there is -- it's coming in lower and later. And we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very near-term numbers that we cited earlier. \nRyan Nash: Got it. Maybe as my quick follow-up for Andrew. I guess, given Rich's answer, what does that mean for the trajectory of the allowance? It seems like we've heard a handful of other issuers talk about us being at the peak or maybe even coming down and potentially being below where it ended the prior year. Can you maybe just talk about what you think this means for Capital One, given your credit expectations? \nAndrew Young: Yes. Sure, Ryan. I'd like to say from my perspective that there's a simple answer but there's not. And then there's a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here, not the least of which is growth, but just focusing on coverage and assuming that's what others are pointing to. The first thing I'd highlight and I said in my talking points that fourth quarter had seasonal balances, they quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore, have negligible coverage, which we see every year.\n So the coverage ratio this quarter up a bit from last quarter is really a result of that dynamic. But if you look at coverage ratio now, it's largely in line with the preceding quarters, I mean, the biggest driver as we look ahead, are the projected loss rates. And as we've been saying for a number of quarters, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that. And so every quarter, we're going to look out over the next 12 months and then the reversion from there. And we're going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties. And so you've seen over the last few quarters, keeping the coverage ratio flat. I will note, though, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might indicate a release otherwise, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance.\n And so eventually, the projected losses will -- when they're lower will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And under that scenario, you would see a decline. But at this point, like I'm not going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because, like I said, we really need to take the factor of uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving process. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. \nMihir Bhatia: Rich, if I could switch for a second to the Discover acquisition. There's been a lot of talk around deal approval, particularly focusing around potential antitrust issues within the Card business. And I was wondering if you could share your thoughts and perspective on that issue if you've heard anything from regulators but also just to hear how you are thinking about that issue? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thank you, Mihir. So we have filed our merger applications with both the Fed and the OCC and we are engaged with the -- sorry, with the DOJ as they, of course, play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on competition questions. We believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval. We believe strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks and credit card issuers and payment networks, and provide significant benefits for consumers, merchants and the communities that we serve. While some have raised concerns about competition, we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling.\n On the network side, let's remember that we're not currently in that business. If the deal is approved,  we will still have 4 networks just like we do today but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of the 4 networks and be able to leverage our technology talent and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance Discovery's competitive viability. Their market share was 6% a decade ago and sits at just 4% today. The significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants as we've outlined in our regulatory applications.\n On the Credit Card side, the regulators have found every time they've studied it that the credit card market is highly competitive and not at all concentrated. In fact, it's less concentrated today than it was 10 years ago. Consumers can choose from over 4,000 issuers, all able to offer products with similar capabilities. Imagine this, a card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like Capital One can be used, anywhere in the world, that kind of level playing field doesn't exist in any other industry and certainly not in airlines or grocery stores or many of the others. There's a reason that we ask folks what's in your wallet. We compete not only with these 4,000 other issuers to gain your business in the first place but also with every other card you likely already own. Put another way, we have to compete every day for every single transaction because our customers can simply choose at any moment to use another card. And if they don't like the card they have, they can stop using it entirely or close the account or switch to another card with another bank, large or small, in minutes.\n We also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business as thousands of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate. New and incumbent fintechs backed by significant VC funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like Marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth.\n Also, any existing bank can choose where in the credit spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy. Let's also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely, cash, debit or buy now pay later, which has exploded onto the marketplace. New fintechs are entering the payments in small-dollar credit space every day all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like Capital One. We faced this competition for years and we'll continue to face it in the future. It's powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely competitive marketplace.  But we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry. We're the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees, no minimums and no overdraft fees.\n So pulling way up,  we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants. In the end, that is what we believe the regulators will use their very vigorous process to evaluate. \nMihir Bhatia: Got it. That is helpful. Just turning back to the health of the consumer for a second for my follow-up. If you could just talk a little bit about the environment for card acquisitions, you did mention, I think, that the growth you see good growth opportunities in the card business. So wondering if you can expand on that. Maybe talk about just some of the puts and takes as you consider where to make those investments? Are there parts of the market where you're being more cautious given the environment? \nRichard Fairbank: Mihir, we are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business, powered by a healthy consumer and the traction that we're getting in our business, we are really all parts of the card business are seeing very nice account originations, seeing good traction on the purchase volume side. And -- so it's very much a positive time for leaning in, as you see reflected in our marketing, as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers, and as I see in numbers behind the numbers that you see, just a lot of traction. And just -- let's just savor for a second, some of the things that are powering that are 2 things that I would flag is: one, the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market. And I think that not only affects our success at the top of the market but I really believe there's a lifting of all boats from those investments and that traction there.\n Also we continue to just have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation, including not only the customer experience and some of the product capabilities that we're able to offer but really impacts on the whole way that we run the business and very notably on the credit and marketing side of the business, the ability to create mass customized offerings and real-time solutions just enables us to have more traction on the growth side.\n Also, I just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the Auto business and also we continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. \nRichard Shane: Rich, I want to make sure I fully understand what you're describing in terms of credit. The framework is that charge-off rates will be about 15% higher than '18, '19 levels in the near term. But now with tax refunds, it might be a little bit higher than that, that over time, it will converge back towards slightly above '18, '19 levels. When I look at the delinquencies. And 1 of the things we've observed is that role from delinquency to charge-off is actually higher than it has been pretty much at any time in recent history. Does that suggest that delinquencies actually need to get back below '18, '19 levels to achieve that level of charge-off performance? \nRichard Fairbank: So Rick, there's a lot. First of all, let me clarify some of the things that you were saying weren't exactly I think as we intended to state them. So let me just -- so we talked about -- so yes, we talked about credit. We're saying credit settling out. We said in the very near term, where charge-offs are tend to be higher in the first half of the year. In the near term, based on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates we would expect them to settle out at 15% higher than pre-pandemic. That was a near-term forecast. That was not an annual forecast. And then you -- just to clarify your comments that, and over time, it will converge back to slightly above 2018 and 2019. I just want to say those are your words, not ours. We have not given guidance on full year charge-offs. We tend not generally to give guidance on full year charge-offs. But we very much like to give you the feel of how things are going.\n So we are very much see credit settling out. You can see that the trends that continue on the second derivative of delinquencies, and that's a very positive thing. The -- there's another factor that affects charge-offs, which is recoveries. And the recoveries have been -- we've been saying for quite some time, recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low charge-offs we saw over the past 3 years. So that all else equal, pushes up net losses relative to pre-pandemic levels. And that impacts probably larger and more prolonged for us than for some of our competitors because we tend to have higher recovery rates than the industry probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy, and we tend to work most of our recoveries in-house rather than selling debt. So we see a longer tail of recoveries from past charge-offs than most do.\n So by the way, the recoveries, we had talked about recoveries. There probably sort of been at their bottom in terms of that brown out and over time probably heading in a more positive direction. But that also impacts the relationship between charge-offs, prepandemic and where they are today. So pulling way up, we don't have guidance for credit for the year. We continue to be very happy about charge-offs the way after years of -- after a long period of normalization, that charge-offs are settling out. We've given -- we just wanted to flag that the seasonality, let's just comment -- let's just pause for a second on the seasonality. It still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower end of story or whether they're later The key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they have been -- than they were pre-pandemic for this period of time. And what will take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how much was lower.\n But what we're saying is, to the extent that it's lower than that impacts in the very near term the charge-off numbers that we had talked about before. But it doesn't change our view about Credit settling out. It doesn't change our view about very positively about the Consumer, about Credit performance, but it's just something we wanted to flag across both the Credit Card and Auto business. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. \nJohn Pancari: I guess back to the Discover combination, any update to your thoughts around the timing of the deal close? I know the Fed, the OCC just extended the comment period. And I know you put out there, you expect late '24, early '25. So any change in terms of your expectation around the timing of the close or any of the key financial metrics that you set out? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, John. So let me comment on the Federal Reserve and the OCC extending the comment period. It's standard practice for the Federal Reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers. We expected the extension and we don't take any signaling on our deal from the Fed's decision here. So with respect to the overall timing, the Fed and the OCC typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in consultation with the DOJ on competition questions and they engage frequently with our team along the way. And of course, that process is underway. And we continue to have the same views about the timing of all of this that we did at the time of the announcement. \nJohn Pancari: Okay. Okay. Great. And then separately, just regarding the -- your expectation on the CET1 front for a pro forma CET1 ratio of about just shy of 14%. Any change to that expectation? And any change to your thoughts around buyback activity in the near term? Could you remain active on that front? \nAndrew Young: Yes, John, with respect to the deal, I'll just say, as we talked about when we announced it, we, at the time, used a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the CET1 at the time of close. There's a number of variables that are going to move between now and in legal day 1, not just the stand-alone performance of each of our companies but balance sheet marks, some of which are driven by credit and stock price. And so I'm not going to be in the business of sort of recasting every time a little number moves. But I will say our valuation of the deal considered a wide range of outcomes. And so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic benefits of the transaction as we did when we announced the deal.\n With respect to our stand-alone repurchases, Capital Ones, I'll note that the agreement with Discover does not prohibit us from buying shares. I noted in my prepared remarks, we were blacked out for a period leading up to the deal. And afterwards, the SEC has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can do for a period of time after the announcement. So as a result of those limitations, Q1 had a pace that was less than what we've done in recent quarters. I will also just note that there's also blackout restrictions on repurchases during the proxy vote period. But again, outside of those blackouts, we're not prohibited, and we're able to continue repurchasing shares. \nJeff Norris: Next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Rich, putting aside the tax refund thing, I mean, yours -- we're sitting here looking you've still got what has been a somewhat persistently high inflation environment and the potential for increases in unemployment, given the nature of your portfolio, you've got kind of a lower end consumer and higher-end consumer. How do you think about that, those factors in terms of thinking about what type of charge-off level you're going to reach over some period of time, not a particular point in time, but over some point in the next year or 2, like where you think about that -- they driving a higher level of charge-off expectations? Or how should we think about that? \nRichard Fairbank: Moshe, so our -- I think what you're partly getting at is because we have -- part of our portfolio is subprime consumers, how do we feel about how they're performing and sort of in the context of an environment of higher inflation and so on. Let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer. In the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions, subprime -- we saw that, but then we saw sort of everything move proportionately, in fact, subprime moved frankly, somewhat less proportionately than prime as a multiple, but obviously, all portfolios worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis in the pandemic, subprime credit improved more and more quickly than prime but it also began to normalize more quickly, too. And of course, that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding that over time.\n And subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they are somewhat correlated. So on the other hand, so if we look at how they have been doing, the income growth from -- for say, lower-income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years. And we have seen really quite -- other than the tax refund effect, which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the higher credit end. Really, we have seen the subprime performance be very strong. It just worsened faster. And then on a proportional basis, everything caught up with it. But it frankly always seems to be a first mover, and it settled out, frankly, a little bit earlier than -- started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio.\n So based on current performance, we feel very good across the credit spectrum. We also -- it certainly catches our attention when we see the inflation specter sort of become greater lately. So we have a real eye on that. As you know, we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on. But the net impression that I would leave you is we continue to feel very good about really the full spectrum of our customers, we continue to lean into the growth opportunities. We have, for some time, just been doing some trimming around the edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that credit line increases. But the impression that I want to leave with you is that we are still pretty feel good about this marketplace and the growth opportunities there. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You alluded to or Andrew alluded to the fact that you expect that late fee -- you can still kind of achieve your objectives from a efficiency ratio even with the late fee coming into effect. But could you talk a little bit about your thoughts about any mitigating efforts that you're planning or in the process of doing? Or is it something that you're going to try and use from a competitive standpoint to take share? How do you think about it? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Thanks, Moshe. So let's just pull up and reflect on the fact that the CFPB's rule on late fees is scheduled to take effect on May 14. We are prepared to implement the rule on this time line, if necessary, but ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule. As we've said before, when the rule is implemented, there will be significant impact to our P&L. We expect that this impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions. These mitigating actions include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway. We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out. Ultimately, these mitigating actions will play through different line items in the P&L and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our P&L within a couple of years of their implementation. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. \nDonald Fandetti: Yes. Rich, can you provide your latest thoughts on auto lending? I know a lot of focus has been around cards, but -- and used car prices have been a little bit lighter recently as well as the tax issue. Maybe talk a bit about a potential pivot there. \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So we're feeling very good about the Auto business. So let's just pull way up. Auto industry margins have recovered somewhat over the past few quarters. Our origination volumes in Q1 were up 20% on a year-over-year basis and a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we're pleased with that growth. Now there are still headwinds to the auto business. Affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car prices. And even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks, they haven't yet reached a new equilibrium.\n So we anticipated the risks in this business, tightening up credit back in 2022, I think, several quarters before some of our competitors. As a result, the performance of recent originations from '22 and '23 has been really strong and frankly, even better than our pre-pandemic originations. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. And as margins have recovered a bit, we're seeing an opportunity to lean back in. So our years of investments in industry-leading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks.\n So looking ahead, we remain confident in the business that we're booking and bullish about the opportunities for growth. So we continue to set pricing in terms that we're comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities that we see in the market. And after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back. I think this is sort of a period where it's moving more into a leaning into it situation for Capital One. And we're, I think, very benefited by the choices that we made over the last couple of years and seeing very strong performance in our vintages. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Rich, I think your point on tax refund is clearly a very valid one. Interestingly, though, to your point on the second derivative, that's improved quite nicely even into March. And I think when I look at the tax refund stats now from the IRS, it seems like you've seen a catch-up in refunds and it seems like the average refund numbers have kind of come in line with last year, if not slightly higher. So I think those are improving, too. Is there a lag effect there? So like should we see that more pronounced if that's the case in April and May? How has been in the past? \nRichard Fairbank: Yes. So I can see that you're a student of tax refunds. Just think of all the areas of expertise that you've developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business, things that neither you nor I thought we would really have to learn. Let me make a couple of comments here. So a key question is what are we benchmarking things too. So relative to -- if we talk about relative to last year, the things were even lagging relative to last year, and they've actually crossed over very, very recently crossed over the curve from last year, which I think you're referring to. But then last year really was somewhat of an outlier relative to pre-pandemic.\n Now one might ask, well, why didn't we just used last year as the seasonality benchmark? Last year itself was an odd year. And from a credit point of view with all the normalization. It was hard to read things through the noise. As we watch the patterns this year, we're going to really end up comparing by the time it's done, how this year compares to last year and whether collectively this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we have to modify relative to the past. I think it's premature on that. And relative to reading seasonality, it's really hard to look at last year's credit metrics just because there was so much normalization.\n So we've had an eye on this. We have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks, which are developed over a number of years. And I think when this is -- when we're done with this period, we'll sit back and look at it and say, did we learn something about the business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a business like ours than it was before. I think it is too early to tell. But to your other point, even relative to last year, it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds. And yes, to your point, these are things that themselves then have lag effects because people have to get the refunds then they have to make payments. So this is why very much we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort of in the middle of happening. And the key thing will be by the time it's done was the cumulative tax refund effect. And we're just kind of sharing with you as we go along.\n And the reason I'm particularly leaning into this particular one is because last time we made a very near-term sort of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets about where the -- given that in a year, the high part of the year is in the first half of the year, we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year, where things were sort of settling out. And I wanted to give that a little bit -- we're not revising the number but just to say if the seasonality patterns are probably driven by the tax refund effect if it doesn't catch up to historical patterns, then in the very near term, the numbers will be higher than that in this very -- this window we're talking about higher than the 15% number that I said. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Understood. Understood. The second derivative looked good nonetheless for March. \nRichard Fairbank: Right. So look, can I just -- I want to just seize that point. The second derivative continues to be strong. In fact, when you look at sort of all the card players, you can see the strength of Capital One's second derivative. There's another topic, so you didn't know when you were studying all that calculus that this would be at the heart of what you do. But -- so there's lots of good to pull from this. I just wanted to just clarify the tax refund effect, which I think has a little bit more impact on Capital One than certain other players and to point out that we actually think we see that effect in both of our consumer businesses. \nSanjay Sakhrani: Great. Just one follow-up for Andrew. Just on the capital return question earlier. Can we step up the run rate relative to some of the last quarters as we look ahead? I know there's been a lot of volatility on some of the regulatory proposals on capital. But as we look ahead, I know there's no limitations but can we see a step up in the level of capital return relative to the past few quarters as we look ahead, given your capital levels today? \nAndrew Young: Well, there's 2 parts to that, Sanjay. The first is, given the transaction, we are in the process of submitting a new capital plan. So that's just a procedural piece. So once that new capital plan is approved, then we have unlimited capacity relative to the SCB in this intervening period, the amount that we repurchase is constrained to what we've requested. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. \nBill Carcache: Rich and Andrew, following up on your comments on Auto, how much of an advantage is your excess capital position? Are you seeing competitors who are capital constrained and perhaps can't take advantage of the attractive market conditions to the same degree? And then I'll just ask my follow-up now. As Capital One continues to grow, could you speak to your category 2 preparedness? \nAndrew Young: Yes, I'll start, Bill, with the -- Rich, do you want to do the... \nRichard Fairbank: Competitive dynamics in auto. Here my observation about the auto business is that it's still a very competitive marketplace. But when we see our opportunities to grow, we tend to zig a little bit while others zag. And so we sort of pulled back for a little while and others leaned in. And my point is really now I think we're leaning in and others are pulling back a little bit more. I hadn't really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that Capital One has by virtue of our choices that we made over the last couple of years. But we'll have to think about that. But I just think this is just very much sort of as you've seen numerous times in the past where there's a little bit of an inflection point for Capital One at a time that's a little different and occasionally in a different direction than the inflection points of others. \nAndrew Young: And then, Bill, with respect to category 2. Well, first, let me just note, we're going to be below the $700 billion threshold at closing and the trigger is really a 4-quarter average beyond that. So I just wanted to mention the specifics of what is going to trigger it. But within category 2 to category 3, there's really 3 big distinctions. The first one is losing the tailoring benefit for LCR and NSFR, and you can see based on the ratios that we hold there and our conservatism around liquidity. We feel very well prepared. The other 2, which are the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital and the DTA threshold going from 25 to 10. Those are both already included at least in what was proposed for the Basel III end game rules. We all know that those proposals are being debated and refined. But ultimately, we're looking at those 2 implications as part of the proposal anyway.\n And so we don't really see a big difference in the long-term implications, at least as we sit today, again, the proposal may take a different form. But from a planning perspective, those were 2 things that we already had our eye on. And so we ultimately feel well prepared all of the implications of either category 2 or the Basel III end game proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed. \nJeff Norris: Next question, please. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. \nJeffrey Adelson: Rich, I just wanted to circle back on your comment about how you continue to kind of trim around the edges. I think last quarter, you were suggesting that the trimming was sort of abating after a number of years of trimming. But given your comments today about how you're continuing to lean in, how the U.S. consumer remains a strength of source, how are you thinking about potentially opening up the credit box a little bit more from here? And relatedly, does the pending deal with Discover factor into how you're thinking about allocating capital at all into more growth at this point? \nRichard Fairbank: Thanks, Jeff. We -- the trimming around the edges is, of course, what we do all the time and reactively to not only what we observe in the marketplace but what we think may be coming in the marketplace. We are very much sort of in the same place we were three months ago when we've been talking about this. In other words, the trimming around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced in the quarters during the big credit normalization than it has been as we see things settling out. And the drivers of that continue to be -- probably -- in addition to what I said about the consumer, very much also the -- observing our credit performance, not only just the overall portfolio performance but very much the performance of our originations.\n And strikingly, our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarter after quarter. Obviously, that's lagged data that we're viewing but we're -- we've been struck by how long it's been and how consistently it's been that our originations have been generally on top of each other. And a lot of that comes from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing even as there's been some underlying a little bit sort of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics. So we're in a very similar place to where we were. We feel good about our credit performance and origination performance. We are leaning in across the credit spectrum.\n With respect to the Discover deal, it's not really altering our origination strategy that's very much continuing as it was before. Obviously, we're very excited about the Discover deal. But I think that with respect to our own strategy it's really pretty much the same as it was before. \nJeffrey Adelson: And I also wanted to just ask really quickly about the small business car strategy. I know you recently just launched that new Venture X business card recently. It seems like a really unique value proposition with the charge card component. Can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity to drive growth there and maybe how that's going so far? Any early reason to the type of customers you're getting? \nRichard Fairbank: Okay. Yes, Jeff. So we launched the Venture X business card, broadly in the third quarter of last year, and we're pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. So Venture X business, much like our Spark cash plus card was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset spending limit, great travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere. And it's a great example of our business is leveraging each other's innovations because we've taken many of the industry-leading travel features of our consumer Venture X product and combine them with the business-grade capabilities of our small business offerings, including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger businesses.\n So we have been investing in our small business card program, and more broadly, to win at the top of the market for years. And this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment, it stands on the shoulders of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of Capital One to win at the top of the market across consumers and small business. So I appreciate the question and we certainly are excited by our continuing progress. \nJeff Norris: Thanks, Rich and Andrew. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this evening and for your continuing interest in Capital One. Have a great evening. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows first quarter results in our Credit Card business. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. Top line growth trends in the Domestic Card business remained strong in the first quarter. Year-over-year purchase volume growth for the first quarter was 6%. \n Ending loan balances increased $12.9 billion or about 10% year-over-year. Average loans increased 11%, and first quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 5.94%, about 18% above its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 82 basis points from the prior year to 4.48%. \n On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 59 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 13 basis points. The linked-quarter delinquency and charge-off rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from normal seasonality. We believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far in 2024, relative to what we've historically observed.\n Tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality. Each year, they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in February.  Our portfolio trends generally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average. Last quarter, our view was that the charge-off rate was settling out about 15% above 2019 levels in the near term. That was based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over 3 to 6 months, and that was the horizon of our estimate.\n If the trend of lower tax refunds sustains, it could raise the level of charge-off somewhat in the near term but this does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019. The continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends sometimes referred to as the improving second derivative supports our view.  The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the first quarter.\n Domestic Card noninterest expense was up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1 billion for the quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Total company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our Domestic Card and Consumer Banking businesses and builds and leverages the value of our brand. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation.\n Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic Card business. And in the first quarter, Domestic Card marketing also included higher early spend businesses driven by strong new account growth, higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal, airport lounges and Capital One shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise.  \n As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks.\n Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, Auto originations increased 21% from the prior year quarter, a return to growth after several quarters of year-over-year declines. Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $3.1 billion or 4% year-over-year, on a linked quarter basis ending loans were essentially flat. We posted another quarter of year-over-year growth in consumer deposits. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up just under $10 billion or 3% year-over-year.\n Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter, powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth. Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 13% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs.\n Noninterest expense was down about 3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank. The Auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.99%,  up 46 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.28%, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 20 basis points, while the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 106 basis points. The linked-quarter charge-off rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical seasonal patterns we've historically observed driven by the tax refund trends I just discussed. Even with the tax refund effects, auto credit performance remains strong.\n Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 5% from the linked quarter. Average deposits were down about 8%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances. First quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Noninterest expense was up about 6%. \n The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the first quarter decreased 40 basis points from the sequential quarter to 0.13%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.39%  down 42 basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 44 basis points to 1.28%.  Commercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio, which is less than 1% of total company loan balances.\n In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter. We posted another quarter of top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. Domestic Card credit trends continue to stabilize and Auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We grew consumer deposits and we added liquidity and maintain capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet. Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to transform our technology, and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time.\n For the full year 2024, we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to 2023.  Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming the rule takes effect in October 2024. The timing of the new rule remains uncertain. If the rule were to take effect at an earlier date, it would be a headwind to the 2024 operating efficiency ratio.\n Of course, the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discover. We've submitted our application for regulatory approval and we're fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration. The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover payment  position Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform and adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of Credit Card purchase volume to the Discover network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses and consumers and driving enhanced network growth.\n In the Credit Card business, we're bringing together 2 proven franchises with complementary strategy and a shared focus on the customer. And we can accelerate the growth of our national digital first consumer banking business by adding the Discover's consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debt network.\n We will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11 years transformation across every business and the network, which will serve as the catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk management and compliance underwriting marketing and customer service.\n Pulling way up, the acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity. It will create Consumer Banking and global payments platform with unique capability, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers compelling financial results and it offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers, and an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term.\n And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff? Thank you, Ryan. Look, I think that the story continues to be one of -- well, in terms of -- there's sort of the consumer itself. Let's just talk about the consumer for a second and then let's talk about Capital One's credit performance but just the health of the consumer. I think the U.S. consumer remains a source of strength in the economy. The labor market remains strikingly resilient.  Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards. And when we look at our customers, we see that they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic, and this is true across income levels.\n On the other hand, of course, inflation shrank real incomes for almost 2 years. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. And I think at the margin, these effects stretch some consumers financially. So -- but on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative -- pretty strong shape relative to historical benchmarks. So in terms of Capital One's performance, we continue to see a settling out. We consider -- we believe that for Capital One, I can't speak for all card issuers but we definitely have seen what we think is sort of a landing.\n And our -- so we feel very good about where the credit is. The point that I wanted to make about the tax refunds, let's just pull up for a second on that. The tax refunds are something that nobody knows for sure exactly what's behind seasonality but I think it's a -- we believe, a very important driver of seasonality. It's a bigger effect for us than other players because I think cash refunds just play a little bit bigger role in -- collectively across our customer base.\n So the tax refunds in the very near-term effect credit performance, Ryan, what you're referring to the 15% guidance that we gave, that was not an annual guidance number that was saying, if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of delinquencies and delinquency roll rates. That's where we would see charge-offs, and charge-offs tend to be higher in the first half of the year. So what we're doing is giving a window to the higher part of charge-offs for the year, and we were saying they were settling out looked like around 15% above 2019 levels.\n Part of that -- and so basically, what I'm saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the seasonality effect. As we can see in the government data, tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns. And so that affects our near-term credit performance. And actually, we often talk about, well, isn't the 6-month window basically once charge-offs start bubbling and going through the roll rate buckets we can pretty much see where charge-offs are going. Tax refunds actually affect the payment rates in every bucket.\n So our point was in the very near term, it actually leads to a bit of a higher charge-off rate than we had guided to over that near window. But that doesn't change our view that credit has settled out but the 15% was not a guidance for the year. We haven't really given credit guidance for the year. What we're really saying is we have seen credit settle out but we wanted to just flag that both in the Credit Card business and in our Auto business while credit continues to be very strong, and you've seen things like really improving delinquencies, we just wanted to point out that in the very near term, relative to what we have seen in terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds, there is -- it's coming in lower and later. And we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very near-term numbers that we cited earlier. Okay. Thank you, Mihir. So we have filed our merger applications with both the Fed and the OCC and we are engaged with the -- sorry, with the DOJ as they, of course, play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on competition questions. We believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval. We believe strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks and credit card issuers and payment networks, and provide significant benefits for consumers, merchants and the communities that we serve. While some have raised concerns about competition, we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling.\n On the network side, let's remember that we're not currently in that business. If the deal is approved,  we will still have 4 networks just like we do today but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of the 4 networks and be able to leverage our technology talent and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance Discovery's competitive viability. Their market share was 6% a decade ago and sits at just 4% today. The significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants as we've outlined in our regulatory applications.\n On the Credit Card side, the regulators have found every time they've studied it that the credit card market is highly competitive and not at all concentrated. In fact, it's less concentrated today than it was 10 years ago. Consumers can choose from over 4,000 issuers, all able to offer products with similar capabilities. Imagine this, a card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like Capital One can be used, anywhere in the world, that kind of level playing field doesn't exist in any other industry and certainly not in airlines or grocery stores or many of the others. There's a reason that we ask folks what's in your wallet. We compete not only with these 4,000 other issuers to gain your business in the first place but also with every other card you likely already own. Put another way, we have to compete every day for every single transaction because our customers can simply choose at any moment to use another card. And if they don't like the card they have, they can stop using it entirely or close the account or switch to another card with another bank, large or small, in minutes.\n We also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business as thousands of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate. New and incumbent fintechs backed by significant VC funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like Marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth.\n Also, any existing bank can choose where in the credit spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy. Let's also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely, cash, debit or buy now pay later, which has exploded onto the marketplace. New fintechs are entering the payments in small-dollar credit space every day all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like Capital One. We faced this competition for years and we'll continue to face it in the future. It's powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely competitive marketplace.  But we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry. We're the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees, no minimums and no overdraft fees.\n So pulling way up,  we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro-consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants. In the end, that is what we believe the regulators will use their very vigorous process to evaluate. Mihir, we are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business, powered by a healthy consumer and the traction that we're getting in our business, we are really all parts of the card business are seeing very nice account originations, seeing good traction on the purchase volume side. And -- so it's very much a positive time for leaning in, as you see reflected in our marketing, as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers, and as I see in numbers behind the numbers that you see, just a lot of traction. And just -- let's just savor for a second, some of the things that are powering that are 2 things that I would flag is: one, the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market. And I think that not only affects our success at the top of the market but I really believe there's a lifting of all boats from those investments and that traction there.\n Also we continue to just have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation, including not only the customer experience and some of the product capabilities that we're able to offer but really impacts on the whole way that we run the business and very notably on the credit and marketing side of the business, the ability to create mass customized offerings and real-time solutions just enables us to have more traction on the growth side.\n Also, I just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the Auto business and also we continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank. So Rick, there's a lot. First of all, let me clarify some of the things that you were saying weren't exactly I think as we intended to state them. So let me just -- so we talked about -- so yes, we talked about credit. We're saying credit settling out. We said in the very near term, where charge-offs are tend to be higher in the first half of the year. In the near term, based on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates we would expect them to settle out at 15% higher than pre-pandemic. That was a near-term forecast. That was not an annual forecast. And then you -- just to clarify your comments that, and over time, it will converge back to slightly above 2018 and 2019. I just want to say those are your words, not ours. We have not given guidance on full year charge-offs. We tend not generally to give guidance on full year charge-offs. But we very much like to give you the feel of how things are going.\n So we are very much see credit settling out. You can see that the trends that continue on the second derivative of delinquencies, and that's a very positive thing. The -- there's another factor that affects charge-offs, which is recoveries. And the recoveries have been -- we've been saying for quite some time, recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low charge-offs we saw over the past 3 years. So that all else equal, pushes up net losses relative to pre-pandemic levels. And that impacts probably larger and more prolonged for us than for some of our competitors because we tend to have higher recovery rates than the industry probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy, and we tend to work most of our recoveries in-house rather than selling debt. So we see a longer tail of recoveries from past charge-offs than most do.\n So by the way, the recoveries, we had talked about recoveries. There probably sort of been at their bottom in terms of that brown out and over time probably heading in a more positive direction. But that also impacts the relationship between charge-offs, prepandemic and where they are today. So pulling way up, we don't have guidance for credit for the year. We continue to be very happy about charge-offs the way after years of -- after a long period of normalization, that charge-offs are settling out. We've given -- we just wanted to flag that the seasonality, let's just comment -- let's just pause for a second on the seasonality. It still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower end of story or whether they're later The key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they have been -- than they were pre-pandemic for this period of time. And what will take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how much was lower.\n But what we're saying is, to the extent that it's lower than that impacts in the very near term the charge-off numbers that we had talked about before. But it doesn't change our view about Credit settling out. It doesn't change our view about very positively about the Consumer, about Credit performance, but it's just something we wanted to flag across both the Credit Card and Auto business. Okay. Thanks, John. So let me comment on the Federal Reserve and the OCC extending the comment period. It's standard practice for the Federal Reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers. We expected the extension and we don't take any signaling on our deal from the Fed's decision here. So with respect to the overall timing, the Fed and the OCC typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in consultation with the DOJ on competition questions and they engage frequently with our team along the way. And of course, that process is underway. And we continue to have the same views about the timing of all of this that we did at the time of the announcement. Moshe, so our -- I think what you're partly getting at is because we have -- part of our portfolio is subprime consumers, how do we feel about how they're performing and sort of in the context of an environment of higher inflation and so on. Let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer. In the global financial crisis, we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions, subprime -- we saw that, but then we saw sort of everything move proportionately, in fact, subprime moved frankly, somewhat less proportionately than prime as a multiple, but obviously, all portfolios worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis in the pandemic, subprime credit improved more and more quickly than prime but it also began to normalize more quickly, too. And of course, that's in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding that over time.\n And subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they are somewhat correlated. So on the other hand, so if we look at how they have been doing, the income growth from -- for say, lower-income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years. And we have seen really quite -- other than the tax refund effect, which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the higher credit end. Really, we have seen the subprime performance be very strong. It just worsened faster. And then on a proportional basis, everything caught up with it. But it frankly always seems to be a first mover, and it settled out, frankly, a little bit earlier than -- started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio.\n So based on current performance, we feel very good across the credit spectrum. We also -- it certainly catches our attention when we see the inflation specter sort of become greater lately. So we have a real eye on that. As you know, we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on. But the net impression that I would leave you is we continue to feel very good about really the full spectrum of our customers, we continue to lean into the growth opportunities. We have, for some time, just been doing some trimming around the edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that credit line increases. But the impression that I want to leave with you is that we are still pretty feel good about this marketplace and the growth opportunities there. Okay. Thanks, Moshe. So let's just pull up and reflect on the fact that the CFPB's rule on late fees is scheduled to take effect on May 14. We are prepared to implement the rule on this time line, if necessary, but ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule. As we've said before, when the rule is implemented, there will be significant impact to our P&L. We expect that this impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions. These mitigating actions include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway. We are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out. Ultimately, these mitigating actions will play through different line items in the P&L and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our P&L within a couple of years of their implementation. Yes. So we're feeling very good about the Auto business. So let's just pull way up. Auto industry margins have recovered somewhat over the past few quarters. Our origination volumes in Q1 were up 20% on a year-over-year basis and a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we're pleased with that growth. Now there are still headwinds to the auto business. Affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car prices. And even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks, they haven't yet reached a new equilibrium.\n So we anticipated the risks in this business, tightening up credit back in 2022, I think, several quarters before some of our competitors. As a result, the performance of recent originations from '22 and '23 has been really strong and frankly, even better than our pre-pandemic originations. And vintage over vintage, that risk remains stable. And as margins have recovered a bit, we're seeing an opportunity to lean back in. So our years of investments in industry-leading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks.\n So looking ahead, we remain confident in the business that we're booking and bullish about the opportunities for growth. So we continue to set pricing in terms that we're comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities that we see in the market. And after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back. I think this is sort of a period where it's moving more into a leaning into it situation for Capital One. And we're, I think, very benefited by the choices that we made over the last couple of years and seeing very strong performance in our vintages. Yes. So I can see that you're a student of tax refunds. Just think of all the areas of expertise that you've developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business, things that neither you nor I thought we would really have to learn. Let me make a couple of comments here. So a key question is what are we benchmarking things too. So relative to -- if we talk about relative to last year, the things were even lagging relative to last year, and they've actually crossed over very, very recently crossed over the curve from last year, which I think you're referring to. But then last year really was somewhat of an outlier relative to pre-pandemic.\n Now one might ask, well, why didn't we just used last year as the seasonality benchmark? Last year itself was an odd year. And from a credit point of view with all the normalization. It was hard to read things through the noise. As we watch the patterns this year, we're going to really end up comparing by the time it's done, how this year compares to last year and whether collectively this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we have to modify relative to the past. I think it's premature on that. And relative to reading seasonality, it's really hard to look at last year's credit metrics just because there was so much normalization.\n So we've had an eye on this. We have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks, which are developed over a number of years. And I think when this is -- when we're done with this period, we'll sit back and look at it and say, did we learn something about the business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a business like ours than it was before. I think it is too early to tell. But to your other point, even relative to last year, it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds. And yes, to your point, these are things that themselves then have lag effects because people have to get the refunds then they have to make payments. So this is why very much we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort of in the middle of happening. And the key thing will be by the time it's done was the cumulative tax refund effect. And we're just kind of sharing with you as we go along.\n And the reason I'm particularly leaning into this particular one is because last time we made a very near-term sort of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets about where the -- given that in a year, the high part of the year is in the first half of the year, we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year, where things were sort of settling out. And I wanted to give that a little bit -- we're not revising the number but just to say if the seasonality patterns are probably driven by the tax refund effect if it doesn't catch up to historical patterns, then in the very near term, the numbers will be higher than that in this very -- this window we're talking about higher than the 15% number that I said. Right. So look, can I just -- I want to just seize that point. The second derivative continues to be strong. In fact, when you look at sort of all the card players, you can see the strength of Capital One's second derivative. There's another topic, so you didn't know when you were studying all that calculus that this would be at the heart of what you do. But -- so there's lots of good to pull from this. I just wanted to just clarify the tax refund effect, which I think has a little bit more impact on Capital One than certain other players and to point out that we actually think we see that effect in both of our consumer businesses. Competitive dynamics in auto. Here my observation about the auto business is that it's still a very competitive marketplace. But when we see our opportunities to grow, we tend to zig a little bit while others zag. And so we sort of pulled back for a little while and others leaned in. And my point is really now I think we're leaning in and others are pulling back a little bit more. I hadn't really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that Capital One has by virtue of our choices that we made over the last couple of years. But we'll have to think about that. But I just think this is just very much sort of as you've seen numerous times in the past where there's a little bit of an inflection point for Capital One at a time that's a little different and occasionally in a different direction than the inflection points of others. Thanks, Jeff. We -- the trimming around the edges is, of course, what we do all the time and reactively to not only what we observe in the marketplace but what we think may be coming in the marketplace. We are very much sort of in the same place we were three months ago when we've been talking about this. In other words, the trimming around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced in the quarters during the big credit normalization than it has been as we see things settling out. And the drivers of that continue to be -- probably -- in addition to what I said about the consumer, very much also the -- observing our credit performance, not only just the overall portfolio performance but very much the performance of our originations.\n And strikingly, our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarter after quarter. Obviously, that's lagged data that we're viewing but we're -- we've been struck by how long it's been and how consistently it's been that our originations have been generally on top of each other. And a lot of that comes from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing even as there's been some underlying a little bit sort of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics. So we're in a very similar place to where we were. We feel good about our credit performance and origination performance. We are leaning in across the credit spectrum.\n With respect to the Discover deal, it's not really altering our origination strategy that's very much continuing as it was before. Obviously, we're very excited about the Discover deal. But I think that with respect to our own strategy it's really pretty much the same as it was before. Okay. Yes, Jeff. So we launched the Venture X business card, broadly in the third quarter of last year, and we're pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. So Venture X business, much like our Spark cash plus card was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset spending limit, great travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere. And it's a great example of our business is leveraging each other's innovations because we've taken many of the industry-leading travel features of our consumer Venture X product and combine them with the business-grade capabilities of our small business offerings, including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger businesses.\n So we have been investing in our small business card program, and more broadly, to win at the top of the market for years. And this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment, it stands on the shoulders of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of Capital One to win at the top of the market across consumers and small business. So I appreciate the question and we certainly are excited by our continuing progress."

            "name": "Andrew Young",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter, Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $3.13 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $42 million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC special assessment.\n Net of this adjusting item, first quarter earnings per share were $3.21. Relative to the prior quarter, period-end loans held for investment decreased 2% and  period-end deposits increased 1%. Both average loans and average deposits were flat. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits remained at 82% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the first quarter increased 13% from the fourth quarter or 6% adjusting for the impacts of FDIC special assessments in both quarters.\n Revenue in the linked quarter declined 1%, largely driven by lower noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 6% on an adjusted basis, driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by $57 million lower net reserve build, partially offset by an $83 million increase in net charge-offs.\n Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $91 million in allowance this quarter, bringing the balance to $15.4 billion, an increase of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our Auto and Domestic Card portfolios. Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 11 basis points to 4.88%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5.\n Our baseline economic forecast modestly improved this quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter, which generally aligns with consensus. We continue to consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 22 basis points to 7.85%. The increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarter's seasonal outstandings.\n In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance increased by $46 million, resulting in a 7 basis point increase to the coverage ratio. The allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the Auto Finance business. And finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $7 million, primarily driven by portfolio contraction. Coverage ratio increased by 1 basis point to 1.72%. \n Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to $127 billion, about $7 billion higher than last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $51 billion, up about $8 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the seasonality of our card balances. Our average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and well above regulatory minimums at 164%. \n Turning to Page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 4 basis points lower than last order and 9 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NIM was largely driven by the impact of having 1 fewer day in the quarter. Modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter.\n Turning to Slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 13.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets more than offset the impact of CECL phase in dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $100 million of shares in the first quarter. Our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the Discover transaction.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich? Yes. Sure, Ryan. I'd like to say from my perspective that there's a simple answer but there's not. And then there's a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here, not the least of which is growth, but just focusing on coverage and assuming that's what others are pointing to. The first thing I'd highlight and I said in my talking points that fourth quarter had seasonal balances, they quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore, have negligible coverage, which we see every year.\n So the coverage ratio this quarter up a bit from last quarter is really a result of that dynamic. But if you look at coverage ratio now, it's largely in line with the preceding quarters, I mean, the biggest driver as we look ahead, are the projected loss rates. And as we've been saying for a number of quarters, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that. And so every quarter, we're going to look out over the next 12 months and then the reversion from there. And we're going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties. And so you've seen over the last few quarters, keeping the coverage ratio flat. I will note, though, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might indicate a release otherwise, you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance.\n And so eventually, the projected losses will -- when they're lower will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain. And under that scenario, you would see a decline. But at this point, like I'm not going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because, like I said, we really need to take the factor of uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving process. Yes, John, with respect to the deal, I'll just say, as we talked about when we announced it, we, at the time, used a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the CET1 at the time of close. There's a number of variables that are going to move between now and in legal day 1, not just the stand-alone performance of each of our companies but balance sheet marks, some of which are driven by credit and stock price. And so I'm not going to be in the business of sort of recasting every time a little number moves. But I will say our valuation of the deal considered a wide range of outcomes. And so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic benefits of the transaction as we did when we announced the deal.\n With respect to our stand-alone repurchases, Capital Ones, I'll note that the agreement with Discover does not prohibit us from buying shares. I noted in my prepared remarks, we were blacked out for a period leading up to the deal. And afterwards, the SEC has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can do for a period of time after the announcement. So as a result of those limitations, Q1 had a pace that was less than what we've done in recent quarters. I will also just note that there's also blackout restrictions on repurchases during the proxy vote period. But again, outside of those blackouts, we're not prohibited, and we're able to continue repurchasing shares. Well, there's 2 parts to that, Sanjay. The first is, given the transaction, we are in the process of submitting a new capital plan. So that's just a procedural piece. So once that new capital plan is approved, then we have unlimited capacity relative to the SCB in this intervening period, the amount that we repurchase is constrained to what we've requested. Yes, I'll start, Bill, with the -- Rich, do you want to do the... And then, Bill, with respect to category 2. Well, first, let me just note, we're going to be below the $700 billion threshold at closing and the trigger is really a 4-quarter average beyond that. So I just wanted to mention the specifics of what is going to trigger it. But within category 2 to category 3, there's really 3 big distinctions. The first one is losing the tailoring benefit for LCR and NSFR, and you can see based on the ratios that we hold there and our conservatism around liquidity. We feel very well prepared. The other 2, which are the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital and the DTA threshold going from 25 to 10. Those are both already included at least in what was proposed for the Basel III end game rules. We all know that those proposals are being debated and refined. But ultimately, we're looking at those 2 implications as part of the proposal anyway.\n And so we don't really see a big difference in the long-term implications, at least as we sit today, again, the proposal may take a different form. But from a planning perspective, those were 2 things that we already had our eye on. And so we ultimately feel well prepared all of the implications of either category 2 or the Basel III end game proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed."
