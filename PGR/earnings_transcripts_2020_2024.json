The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which has been posted to the company's website, and we'll use this event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Although, our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2020, where you will find discussions of the Risk Factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Good afternoon and welcome to The Progressive's fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons, from the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused by social unrest. As I reflect on the year we just closed, I couldn't be more proud of the way Progressive rose to these challenges by delivering fantastic results, while supporting its customers, employees, communities, and partners during these unprecedented times. The Annual Report theme of resilience truly defines how we approached every obstacle during this past year. As of prior quarters, the fourth quarter profitability continued to benefit from reduction in frequency, which was partially offset by an increase in severity. Miles driven continued to be lower than the fourth quarter last year. We continue to react to the changes in driving behavior caused by the pandemic. In addition to the over $1 billion given to customers in the form of credits early on in the pandemic, we also filed personal auto rate changes that averaged a decrease of approximately 3% between April and December in over 40 states that represented approximately 85% of our countrywide premium, thereby providing our customers an aggregate annualized savings estimated at about $800 million. There's much uncertainty about reopenings, vaccine distribution, and if and when we'll return to pre-pandemic driving patterns. Our product teams are staying abreast of the situation and continue to adjust rates to related risks, which include risks such as weather. We continue to recognize both policy and premium growth in the fourth quarter, which combined with the rest of the year resulted in 2020 having an increase of 2.4 million policies in force and $3 billion more net premiums written over the prior year. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit PIF growth. While all of our segments contributed to this growth, our agency auto business was more heavily impacted by the federal, state, and local social distancing, and shelter-in-place restrictions that were put in place to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 which resulted in a decrease in new applications year-over-year. Our commercial lines business saw significant growth in the for-hire transportation business as the demand for shipping services grew as a result of the pandemic. On the other hand, our Uber and Lyft premiums took a hit during the year as the miles driven decreased with restrictions in place and our premiums are based on actual and estimated miles over the policy term. Our property business had a profitable fourth quarter, but with a 2020 Atlantic Hurricane season being the most active on record, it recognized an underwriting loss for the full year. Growth continued to be strong with our bundled Robinson business growing faster than any other segment. We're confident that we have the pricing and product enhancements in place to get closer to our target margins, and we will continue to make changes as we grow. Despite the challenges faced in light of the pandemic, our combination of strong growth and profitability in 2020 suggests we're managing the situation well. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our personal auto product. Our first sale was elevated to our newest product model in January. As part of our Apron Relief Program, we also launched a temporary change to Snapshot that allows existing non-snapshot customers to receive a Snapshot adjusted rate after just 30 days of monitoring as opposed to the normal six months. This, in addition to Snapshot road test, which we had available for several months, gives consumers the ability to see their Snapshot rate before purchasing a policy. While not available countrywide, where it\u2019s available, we believe this is a perfect opportunity for some customers to lower their rates based on either their driving behavior or frequency of their driving habits that have changed as a result of the pandemic. We're also investing in our commercial lines business. Our BOP product is now active in 18 states, Illinois went live last week, and during the fourth quarter was added to our BusinessQuote Explorer platform in the direct channel. Also Smart Haul, our UBI program for truckers, continues to see excellent adoption rates and is a great asset in the for-hire trucking market. And Snapshot ProView, which expands our UBI offerings beyond truck is now available in 45 states. Looking to 2021, I'm happy to report that we're well positioned for further growth as reflected in our January results. We continue to make investments in pricing segmentation, cost efficiency, accurate claims handling, and expense management. Most importantly, we\u2019ve supported our people and retained our culture, which we know will pay huge dividends going forward. Another exciting thing about 2021 is that in April, we'll celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming a public company. A Fun fact, if you bought 100 shares at our IPO in 1971, it would have cost you $1,800. At the end of 2020, that initial investment would have grown to be worth over $19 million, a 20.5 compounded annual return. Not a bad investment especially if you compare it to the 9.9% return by the S&P 500 over that same period. I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our shareholders, both past and present for investing in us over the years. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to express how pleased and excited I'm about the agreement with Protective Insurance Corporation. We've been very impressed with Protective's products, employees, and culture. As we said in the past, commercial lines is our greatest opportunity to grow and we're excited to expand our capabilities with the expertise Protective offers, a larger fleet and affinity programs and by providing additional breadth of product lines. As you know, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we're not able to share additional information at this time. We will provide additional information thoughts after the transaction closes. Chris, I think we can open it up for questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, great. Good afternoon. I guess I think first question maybe on Telematics, and Tricia I listened to some of your comments, you used the word kind of reacting to changing driving patterns. You talked about uncertainty, I think about future driving patterns, and I think we all know that people's workplaces settings will probably continue to adjust into the coming year or so. So just kind of curious, is there any ways or initiatives in the company to kind of scope more all in on kind of Telematics given it feels like it could be more important than ever in order to better understand how to price risk?\nTricia Griffith: It\u2019s a great question, Mike, and actually what I just talked about when I did my opening remarks was something that came out of a discussion that John Sauerland and Pat Callahan and John Murphy and I had when we were talking about the desire to have people -- have the rate be really relevant to people that are driving less. And so, we really in record time created the Apron Relief Snapshot Program, and because time is of the essence, and maybe people are going back to work, maybe they're partially in work, partially not, we wanted to be able to provide our UBI program with a shortened monitoring period. So that 30-day period is really important. So we've sent out to our current customers, millions of emails, and for those where we don't have an email, we're sending out actual USPS mail to alert our customers of this offering and make sure that if they are driving less and they do want to receive a discount or their frequency and severity of driving those down, they can opt for this option. We think that's a fantastic addition to the credits that we gave early on, the rate reductions and our road test option for consumers.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. I'm happy to flush that out. Okay, my final question is specifically on direct-to-consumer advertising. I think we get a lot more questions these days about kind of insurtech firms and even incumbents' kind of pushing into that sandbox, and Progressive is clearly a leader, you guys are growing fast. But curious if you're seeing any of these kind of new entrants\u2019 marketing spend influence any of the economics in the marketplace and how to think about kind of influencing Progressive's ability to win in this space, at least incrementally?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think over the years, we've seen not just our competition that we've had for a long-term, but a lot of the insurtechs going into the space where we feel like we have an advantage, of course, as we buy a large portion of our media in-house, and we make sure that when we acquire a customer that it is under our allowable cost, at or under our allowable costs. And so, I can't go into a lot of proprietary ways with which we do that. But we believe that allows us to have very reasonable acquisition costs, which we believe are much lower than in insurtech.\nJohn Sauerland: Mike, to that I would add, you\u2019ve noted our advertising costs are going up, meaning our spend is going up, and we only spend what we believe it is sufficient. So we have an allowable acquisition cost by segment, and we spend up to that. So generally speaking, if you're seeing our advertising spend go up, you should assume that it's continuing to be very efficient in getting us to the customer set we're after very effectively across all the mediums. So I would say in aggregate at our spend level, we really haven't seen much impact from those newer entrants in the advertising space.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a question first just on personal auto pricing and frequency trends. And it seems like many of your competitors, especially the larger ones, are much more focused on sort of reviving growth and market share because margins have been good for everybody. So what are you seeing in terms of pricing? And are you concerned that maybe pricing continues to soften as frequency begins to pick up as we go through the rest of the year?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think all of us try to do the right thing by consumers initially, and so whether it's credits or giveback, et cetera, I think that was an important part. And now for Progressive for sure, we went in surgically to give the discounts I talked about on average 3%, realize that is on average. So we\u2019re looking very surgically at each state, channel, and products to give the right discount to make sure we manage that tradeoff between growth and profitability. So, I think that, I'm assuming our competitors are doing similar things. For us, it really is about that balance of growth and profitability, and so we're pretty proud of the fact that in 2020, even with the reduced rates and shopping down substantially during the first part of the pandemic, we were able to grow both in prospects and sales on a full year. So, that's really our concentration. We obviously look across our competitor set to see if prices are down. John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this last February, we look at a few big competitors price rates -- prices are still down, premium is down about 1.7%. And so, yes, I think it will continue to be a challenge to grow, but we are up against that challenge as you can see by our January results.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then you highlighted Protective in your comments, but where should we see more of an immediate impact on your business from the deal? And sort of what are your longer-term aspirations on what you can do with the business?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I'm sure you can appreciate that. I can't go into a lot of details until the transaction closes. But suffice it to say, it gives us access to a larger addressable market and affinity programs, and we were impressed with the culture and the people of Protective.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then maybe just one more, on Texas have you disclosed anything or are you able to disclose anything in terms of your exposure?\nTricia Griffith: Well, the losses are coming in, and obviously, it was a big storm. And what I can say is that, Gary Traicoff\u2019s team is working to kind of understand our ultimate reserves, but I'm confident at this juncture with the data I have that it will pierce our $80 million retention threshold on our reinsurance.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon. I guess it's just non-commercial lines. Can you talk about your either given what you currently have either your need, or maybe your willingness to do more acquisitions to continue to expand in the commercial line space?\nTricia Griffith: We always look where we have not been a big acquirer of companies; we always look at both in terms of do we buy, build or partner. And for the most part, whether it's in private passenger auto, or commercial lines, we've tried to build or buy; depending on if you got to something faster, we prefer to grow organically. Obviously, the ARX acquisition had a lot to do with access to customers; we wanted to be able to have those Robinsons in the agency side. When we looked at acquisitions across the commercial landscape, we thought the Protective 1 got us to a larger addressable market that that we may or may not have gotten to at a certain point. We have a lot of irons in the fire right now, though, on commercial as well in terms of growth. And in fact, over the years, I think we've talked about the horizons. And Horizon Two is our biggest growth opportunity. And so right now our focus is really to continue to grow with our bought product, which I talked about, we just rolled out in 18 states, we went from fleet of less than 10 vehicles to 40 and that continues to grow, small business. And then of course, our relationship with a few different companies and transportation network companies. So that's really our focus. We have so many exciting things going on in Horizon Two to grow. If we see something that makes sense, we'll obviously look at it obviously, I can't talk about that if we would but we really do prefer to grow organically and have done so for the past 80 plus years.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks, Tricia. Second one for me is on homeowners and property business, you mentioned in the introductory comments, I guess can you talk about how I guess how satisfied you're with results there in terms of profitability, and then related, somewhat related can you give us an update on the reception in the market for your HomeQuote product?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Let me, look, well, I was very satisfied with the property results in January and the fourth quarter. That, of course, does not take up the whole year. And if you take out weather-related, including cash and other weather, we feel like we're in a good position. So we've taken rates up substantially, we've changed our product model; we continue to have deeper segmentation. February is not going to be a great -- February is not going to be a great month for the industry because of the winter storm and we try to obviously put a load in for those events. And last year was another unprecedented year of hurricanes. So I'm happy with the product. I'm happy with our continued ability to segment, I'm happy with the fact that we're growing Robinsons across the board in both direct and agency channel, we've increased our Platinum agents. And I think you're referring to the HomeQuote Explorer, very happy there. So we saw Progressive Home along with many other unaffiliated partners. And that's been higher growth than even the agency channel; we're very excited about that. It's our highest growing segment. And when you think about having customers for life that was really our basis for acquiring ARX is to make sure that we have those auto home bundled one to allow us to extend our auto policy life expectancy. So our retention, of course, is the Holy Grail, but also have those customers for life, so as their needs change, we have them. We didn't want to be the train wheels when people want home. So those customers we see out on toys and life and other products that we're able to offer either on our paper or not. And I'll tell you, although we don't talk about this externally, the policy life expectancy on Robinson versus some of the other segments are extraordinarily higher. And so we're very happy with that growth. And we'll continue to invest in that area.\nJohn Sauerland: And we're taking action, Progressive Home team on profitability. So last year, we took rates up for our property products a 11.5% basically those are annual policies that all hasn't earned in. We've also taken steps to better balance where we're writing homes to ensure our storm risk is diversified. We've taken actions in terms of policy coverage, as well to ensure that our interests are more aligned with our insurers when it comes to storm losses. So I think we've taken a lot of actions that should show benefits coming into this year. I expect we'll continue to take upgrades this year. But as Tricia noted, it's not surprising to know that February would be a tougher start for the year. But again, I think the Progressive Home team has taken the right actions to get profitability where we wanted for home. And as Tricia noted, we're writing a lot more auto because we have home in the agency channel. You know, think of over a billion of very profitable auto insurance that we believe we would not have had through agents we're now for the opportunity to bundle with risk.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.\nGary Ransom: Yes. I wanted to follow-up on Robinsons and I saw that you increased Platinum agents. And I saw that the -- well it's actually the 12-month policies are up to 12% of the independent agent channel, which I assume as a proxy for the bundles there. But I guess I was trying to get a sense of what's going on in the direct side, because you're apparently growing bundles there also how is that? Can you give us a sense of that?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Well in fact, we're growing bundles even more rapidly on the direct side. And remember those bundles, some of them are with Progressive Home and some are with unaffiliated partners. So we continue to grow both Robinsons and rates in the direct channel. We continue to invest and having the right partnerships to make sure that like John said that we expand our ability to have Robinsons throughout the country and not be so concentrated in the states that -- where there when we first started the acquisition. But we're happy with the growth in the direct side, very happy.\nJohn Sauerland: Gary, just to clarify, you're right to think of the annual policies, just being written by Platinum agents, those are not exclusively Robinsons. They are by far enough away predominately Robinsons, but patients who are Platinum can write annual policies with non-Robinson customers, but it's certainly not part of the majority there. And in direct channel, we do not offer the annual policy for auto.\nTricia Griffith: We called out that segment. If you recall, we had the Sam Diane, Wright's and Robinsons. The Wright's are where it's our auto policy and another home on affiliate partners.\nGary Ransom: Right. Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the Platinum agents too? And I think you've disclosed that for the last three years now. And it's been kind of a steady increase, is there a continued interest among the agencies, agents that you deal with, I'm just trying to get a sense of the underlying trends that are going on there for you?\nTricia Griffith: When we first rolled it out, we really sort of went in it with a scarcity model. And as we've grown and developed, we realized that and we want to make sure that when we make the effort to give you the ability to write annual policies and more commission et cetera, that you're able to have Progressive Home and Progressive Audit be like the number one or two choice in your agency. What we realize though, is around the country, there are some places that and some agencies that are really willing and wanting to write Robinsons, but we didn't necessarily make them Platinum agents, because they might be a smaller agency. But what comes in the door, they want to write often with Progressive. And so that's really been the reason and desire, why we've expanded the number of Platinum agents.\nJohn Sauerland: And Gary, we are as you saw close to 4,000 Platinum agents, added a couple 100 this year, probably a bit lower than we would have otherwise, had we not had COVID going on. But if you're wondering if Platinum agents are growing faster than the rest of the agent population, the answer is definitely yes. We won't be able to share that number regularly. But I believe we shared that in a previous Investor Presentation. And I would tell you the trend on terms of relative growth has continued for Platinum agent -- agents excuse me.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Could we talk a bit about your targeted 96% combined ratio, which is thinking about risk adjusted returns on capital? I would assume that's not static across business lines, and you just provided some color on homeowners and commercial lines. So how would you characterize your targeted combined ratios for businesses that are of higher severity?\nTricia Griffith: We lead obviously our 96%, we've talked about this, a fair amount is in aggregate. So we look at the 96% across products, across new and renewal business, across different channels, because the acquisition costs being different. And then we also look at the ROE on every one of our products as well and try to understand how those two interact together. And so although we don't share anything other than the 96%, we keep -- we think about their risk adjusted rate of return as we develop our targets for each of those combined ratios.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes, just to elaborate a little, we have shared previously in Investor Call relative ranges and combined ratios that we're targeting by each product line and your correct it's not only the severity of claims, but it's generally the volatility and results that drives what relatively speaking the amount of capital, we need to hold against that product line. And we also take into account that there's longer tails in some of those lines. So there are different investing returns across lines of business and bring all that together and generally speaking, target a common ROE. It's not perfect. But those combined ratios that we target by product are definitely driven by our perception of ROE by product line.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, thank you. Yes, I'm familiar with that slide. I guess, looking for some, I guess, underlying guidance, but you said you don't disclose that. So I'll move on. I know that you don't really want to talk about Protective. I'll dance around it a bit and recognize that that does bring in workers comp business. I'm just curious more broadly, what your risk appetite is when looking at workers comp?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, again I'm excited to talk about that once we close this transaction and what'll commit to all of you is I'll have in a subsequent quarterly call Karen Bailo, our President of Commercial Lines coming and talk about it. But, we talked about Progressive strengths are in complementary lines of business and coverages for the transportation industry, where we have been successful in the past. And that was a big selling point for us as well as their affinity programs. And that's really all I can say until the transaction closes.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Looking --\nJohn Sauerland: Go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Oh, no, go ahead.\nJohn Sauerland: I was just going to offer generically, we are in complementary lines, in order to write more vehicle business is the way to think about it, right? So for a long time, we said, we weren't going to go into home, we recognized the opportunity through independent agents, where we found that we had to have our own product in order to penetrate the Robinson market and independent agents. So that probably wouldn't have been our preferred route. And we didn't take it until we absolutely saw the necessity to do so to continue to grow rapidly in that vehicle line. So I think you should think about other lines of business to some degree, being complementary in order to continue to grow the business as fast as we can.\nOperator: Our next question is from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Did you say in your prepared remarks, what the take up rate has been in terms of the 30-day snapshot and relatedly, how far through the book, are you in terms of offering that that feature?\nTricia Griffith: It\u2019s pretty new. We started offering it in February. I think it's been sent out to maybe 5 million customers, I want to say, so far we've had 9,000 that have gone through and gotten just kind of might be off on a little bit of a number. So it's relatively new. Again, we had to file that. So we're through every state regulators to get that approved. And in some states, you can't do that, we don't have UBI. But we're pretty excited about that because I think really did put, in the hands of our customers, the ability to lower their rates, if they're driving less. We'll have more on that next quarter once it kind of flows through the system.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. And then my second question is, I believe on one of these calls last year, you guys spent a lot of time talking about some updates to your homeowners, sort of predictive models. I know 2020 was kind of an odd year. But just any sense in terms of how the new models held up. If you can say anything given how odd last year was?\nTricia Griffith: And when you're saying models, are you talking about like the models we look at for weather or overall like our segmentation models internally?\nSuneet Kamath: Yes, the former, related to weather. I think that was what you guys were highlighting?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. In a sense that actually, we have hired a new risk and reinsurance leader, who was really going to be focusing on, looking at our risk appetite and being more holistic across the enterprise. And then he, what is his big opportunity is to look at is assessing our reliance on models and our usage so a little bit more to come on that. And I think being more planful and coordinated with our placements of reinsurance. So I know it's a little bit off of that, but I know we rely on the Karen Clark model these storms have been pretty unprecedented. I hate using that word again. But the Hurricane season last year was immense in terms of numbers and the numbers that made landfall. And then of course, rarely do you get a winter storm like we had a few weeks ago. So the models generally take those into account. Having somebody with Brandon's depth, I think will really help us to understand and fine tune our reliance on those models. Do you want to add anything, John?\nJohn Sauerland: No, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAdam Klauber: Thanks. How's the BOP rollout coming? Are you at a point where you can get more aggressive with it? And at what point will that actually start moving the needle?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we just rolled out our 18th stay. And I would say yes, we're at the point where it's our thought process. I'm working with Karen and her team to get more aggressive with because it's an exciting new product. We've obviously invested in it over the last couple of years. So while I can't give you the exact state rollout, I think the word you use is accurate. Would you want to get aggressive with our rollout of BOP as the year progresses. Last year there's so much going on, so much noise in the system we have a lot going on our commercial side, but I know Karen's really excited to move on now.\nAdam Klauber: Great. And then TNC was obviously down last year for various reasons, have miles driven started picking-up in that more recently?\nTricia Griffith: Somewhat not to where it was pre-pandemic and we're watching that really closely. And of course, we have great relationship with both Uber and Lyft. And we work with them on the race and watching that driving behavior. And of course, it differs by state as well, but it's not up to pre-pandemic level.\nAdam Klauber: Okay and then sorry last question. You do a lot of digital, digital marketing, you get a lot of customers that way, is the amount of customers whether it's auto or through home, actually doing the full from quote to buying is that increasing or is it still mainly more of a shopping vehicle?\nTricia Griffith: No, that's been increasing over the years, I don't have the exact percentage, I don\u2019t know if you do John, but that's been increasing over the years because I think a lot of people shop that way and want buying that way. In fact, we've invested a lot on that with our quoting on HQX and we have more ability than ever to be able to bind and buy online, both auto and home and also on the agency channel. We've had portfolio of quoting, which allows them to do that as well. So one of our strategic pillars is broad coverage be where, when and how customers want to shop. So if I'm on my phone, I want to be able to bind or with an agent or online, so that continues to increase as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from James Bach with KBW. Your line is open.\nJames Bach: So just looking beyond the obvious growth drivers like the favorable rate environment, can you explain more specifics for Progressive, how important the product launches and the sustained investment in those launches is to growth and possibly enhancing that moving forward? And also how immediate is the payoff for those kinds of investments and those product rollouts?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think, as we talk about our rollouts, whether it's been in Horizon One or Two, I think the product launches are really important. And when we look at what we believe is a strength of ours in industry-leading segmentation, we believe that we'll continue to be a strength of ours. And so we just -- we're finishing our 86 product are in the midst of that, I should say, we rolled out on the auto side 87 in January. And that gives us greater segmentation which is again the right rate for the right risk. And so I think the product models have always been our strengths. We feel the same way on the product side; we're rolling out our NextGen 4.0 product model. And it's always in flux. So we never -- we never say here is a product model, we'll roll it out and not try to make it better, we try to make it better. So there's little we can have, things along the way that will add into the product models once we see if it adds value to get more consumers that are profitable consumers. So that product model period is really important. And it's one of our -- when we think about competitive prices, which of course, this is such a price sensitive industry. Cost and segmentation are a big advantage for us and very important.\nJohn Sauerland: And just to add to that, we see the change in customer mix as an example, immediately. So we've been predominantly enhancing our segmentation towards the preferred end of the marketplace. And every time we introduce a new product model, we're seeing a furthering shift towards that more Preferred Customer set. So it is a huge part of our business. It's a huge competitive advantage. We believe we've invested a lot to ensure that we're very fast to market when we find new rating variables or underwriting approaches. And again, we see the benefit very quickly in terms of who we're writing and who we're converting at a higher rate.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I'll add into that with the Robinson a few years ago, we had an internal goal to at some point get a million Robinsons on the book and we're well in excess of that and it just continues to gain momentum.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I noticed that the percentage of commercial lines premium into the agency channel increased a bit in 2020. And I was wondering how you would characterize the demand you're seeing from small business owners purchasing on a direct basis?\nTricia Griffith: The direct basis is pretty new. So it's on a lower base. And the history would tell you that the majority of our commercial lines have been through the agency channel. We did see a shift in 2020, based on the fact that a lot of agencies were closed. And with our investment in BQX BusinessQuote is for on the direct side, so we have seen a little bit of a shift, the majority of it is still through agents, some of the products can be complex, and people want to be able to have that guidance and that counseling. But we're also innovating and investing for the future to again fulfill our strategic pillar of broad coverage, where, when and how consumers want to shop, including commercial consumer. So while it's still the majority in the agency channel we've invested in and we\u2019ll continue, we believe to see increase in small business BOP GL on the direct side.\nRobert Cox: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: In my opening remarks, I said we had added BOP in the direct side and that happened in fourth quarter last year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. My first question, you obviously you guys report monthly results, even look at the policy trends that I know you often say right not to put too much of a focus on one month, but if I look at your policies in-force in December trends were kind of flat and then we saw I'm talking about sequential December versus November, we saw good pickup in January. So I'm just trying to get a sense of like, the underlying trends within both new business and renewals as you think about the impact of the pandemic and not as much thinking in the market, and how we could think about potential policy growth from here? Sorry, I know, that's a kind of a couple part question. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. I'll talk a little bit about the calendar effects and then go into how we think about growth. And then John, you can add anything you want. So remember, we have a different calendar, we don't go by the Gregorian calendar. In 2019, if you're looking at new apps in particular, it was a 53-week year and quarter four was a 14-week quarter. So when you look at new app growth, year-to-date or I should say in agency, the fourth quarter was down maybe 1% but it was up on the direct side about 3%. If you look at last year, for the quarter, for quarter three, it was down in agency about 4% and up in direct about 8%. These are new apps in particular. You've seen our retention statistics, we're very proud of the fact that our retention continues to increase. We also know part of that is because of the moratoriums are non-canceled. So we know a portion of that has to do with the pandemic. But we also believe that both what we're doing on the nature and nurture side will continue to reap benefits on the retention side. When I think of growth, we look at obviously PIP growth as our preferred measure because trends are going to change up and down depending on things obviously, the pandemic was dramatic. And we can't, we have to react to our trends. And like I said at the beginning, even though no one took rates up last year, we continued to be able to grow new sales and prospects. How we think about it on the auto side and of course, on both the commercial lines, that I've talked about is we're really going to focus on our four strategic pillars. The first one, our people, our culture, we're going to make sure we have the best work environment ever. People that want to serve our customers, and in turn, they reward us with their loyalty. We're going to focus on our brand. So whether it's mass media, digital, making sure that we send out a message of savings and protection and we continue that this year. I've talked a little bit about competitive prices; we care deeply about costs and taking costs out of the system. So that when people do shop us because they love our brand, we converge. And of course the industry-leading segmentation and I talked about the broad coverage. So we're going to continue to focus on that. And -- we -- this year is going to be again another year where it's going to be really hard to compare because the odds are the denominator in March and April because there was relatively no shopping is pretty low. With that, might come and I don't know exactly when the timing will hit income tax returns more stimulus payments, and we're ready and able to write those consumers. So there's going to be a lot of change. I think what we have to be is well positioned, and nimble as things change. And naturally, what my team and I talked about at time, are we ready for this? And so we'll constantly adjust our rate levels to make sure we're competitive, but also profitable, which is one of our core values. We talked about the different product models that we rollout and some of the other items that we've done, like our Snapshot, Apron and other things to do to make sure our customers are taken care of. I know our CRM organization has something in place right now called more time to pay, where you're really trying to personalize that experience if someone just needs a little bit more time or needs some adjustments on their pay plan, because we know retention is important and we know it's important for our customers. So that's a longwinded answer. And I think there's going to be a lot of variables this year, and a lot of it will depend on as states open, if frequency happens. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen and I think of the last pandemic and when will the roaring 2021 to 2022 see, will people be out driving more? We just have to watch the data, and we're going to react really quickly to it.\nElyse Greenspan: How much on -- of the book has moratoriums are non-canceled on it?\nTricia Griffith: How much of the book has moratoriums that are non-canceled?\nJohn Sauerland: Well most states have lifted the requirement to have moratoriums, I think all states have lifted that, there may be a couple less. But by and large to the extent we're accommodating people who might be behind in payment plans that is our own choice. And it is a fairly small portion of our book at this time.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up you guys are looking to make any changes to your reinsurance coverage this year?\nTricia Griffith: I talked about having a new leader in risk and reinsurance. And, partly our property cap program in particular, we were considerate of the minority shareholders in ARX and because upcoming renewal, that's no longer a consideration. So we'll take that in consideration. And as you've noticed, over the years, we've been moving up our retention, we expect our retention in this year's renewal to be at least $100 million. So I know that's a change that is on the books. Other than that, I know Brandon's working with our reinsurers as we come on our renewals. Do you want to add anything?\nJohn Sauerland: Yes, if you look in the K, you'll see a deeper description of our reinsurance and we did raise our retention this year on the aggregate as well. So Tricia was referring to our retention on named storm coverage. And we also increased our aggregate retention to $475 million, up from $375 million last year, they're also adding to the top of our tower. Some of this is simply because we're growing our total insured value. But we're also as Tricia said, with our new risk and reinsurance leader, getting a little more holistic in terms of our risk appetite, and making some changes upcoming to recognize a little more holistic perspective there. As you might recall, we retained much of the reinsurance program in our property business for years because we had a minority interest there remaining. And their buyout was a function of book value. So there were some interest there in not raising that retention. And obviously at our size and balance sheet, we could raise that and not incur any material risk to our balance sheet.\nDoug Constantine: That appears to have been our final question. So that concludes our event. Chris, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes The Progressive Corporation's fourth quarter investor event. Information about replay of the events will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome to The Progressive's fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons, from the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused by social unrest. As I reflect on the year we just closed, I couldn't be more proud of the way Progressive rose to these challenges by delivering fantastic results, while supporting its customers, employees, communities, and partners during these unprecedented times. The Annual Report theme of resilience truly defines how we approached every obstacle during this past year. As of prior quarters, the fourth quarter profitability continued to benefit from reduction in frequency, which was partially offset by an increase in severity. Miles driven continued to be lower than the fourth quarter last year. We continue to react to the changes in driving behavior caused by the pandemic. In addition to the over $1 billion given to customers in the form of credits early on in the pandemic, we also filed personal auto rate changes that averaged a decrease of approximately 3% between April and December in over 40 states that represented approximately 85% of our countrywide premium, thereby providing our customers an aggregate annualized savings estimated at about $800 million. There's much uncertainty about reopenings, vaccine distribution, and if and when we'll return to pre-pandemic driving patterns. Our product teams are staying abreast of the situation and continue to adjust rates to related risks, which include risks such as weather. We continue to recognize both policy and premium growth in the fourth quarter, which combined with the rest of the year resulted in 2020 having an increase of 2.4 million policies in force and $3 billion more net premiums written over the prior year. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit PIF growth. While all of our segments contributed to this growth, our agency auto business was more heavily impacted by the federal, state, and local social distancing, and shelter-in-place restrictions that were put in place to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 which resulted in a decrease in new applications year-over-year. Our commercial lines business saw significant growth in the for-hire transportation business as the demand for shipping services grew as a result of the pandemic. On the other hand, our Uber and Lyft premiums took a hit during the year as the miles driven decreased with restrictions in place and our premiums are based on actual and estimated miles over the policy term. Our property business had a profitable fourth quarter, but with a 2020 Atlantic Hurricane season being the most active on record, it recognized an underwriting loss for the full year. Growth continued to be strong with our bundled Robinson business growing faster than any other segment. We're confident that we have the pricing and product enhancements in place to get closer to our target margins, and we will continue to make changes as we grow. Despite the challenges faced in light of the pandemic, our combination of strong growth and profitability in 2020 suggests we're managing the situation well. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our personal auto product. Our first sale was elevated to our newest product model in January. As part of our Apron Relief Program, we also launched a temporary change to Snapshot that allows existing non-snapshot customers to receive a Snapshot adjusted rate after just 30 days of monitoring as opposed to the normal six months. This, in addition to Snapshot road test, which we had available for several months, gives consumers the ability to see their Snapshot rate before purchasing a policy. While not available countrywide, where it's available, we believe this is a perfect opportunity for some customers to lower their rates based on either their driving behavior or frequency of their driving habits that have changed as a result of the pandemic. We're also investing in our commercial lines business. Our BOP product is now active in 18 states, Illinois went live last week, and during the fourth quarter was added to our BusinessQuote Explorer platform in the direct channel. Also Smart Haul, our UBI program for truckers, continues to see excellent adoption rates and is a great asset in the for-hire trucking market. And Snapshot ProView, which expands our UBI offerings beyond truck is now available in 45 states. Looking to 2021, I'm happy to report that we're well positioned for further growth as reflected in our January results. We continue to make investments in pricing segmentation, cost efficiency, accurate claims handling, and expense management. Most importantly, we've supported our people and retained our culture, which we know will pay huge dividends going forward. Another exciting thing about 2021 is that in April, we'll celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming a public company. A Fun fact, if you bought 100 shares at our IPO in 1971, it would have cost you $1,800. At the end of 2020, that initial investment would have grown to be worth over $19 million, a 20.5 compounded annual return. Not a bad investment especially if you compare it to the 9.9% return by the S&P 500 over that same period. I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our shareholders, both past and present for investing in us over the years. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to express how pleased and excited I'm about the agreement with Protective Insurance Corporation. We've been very impressed with Protective's products, employees, and culture. As we said in the past, commercial lines is our greatest opportunity to grow and we're excited to expand our capabilities with the expertise Protective offers, a larger fleet and affinity programs and by providing additional breadth of product lines. As you know, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we're not able to share additional information at this time. We will provide additional information thoughts after the transaction closes. Chris, I think we can open it up for questions now. It's a great question, Mike, and actually what I just talked about when I did my opening remarks was something that came out of a discussion that John Sauerland and Pat Callahan and John Murphy and I had when we were talking about the desire to have people -- have the rate be really relevant to people that are driving less. And so, we really in record time created the Apron Relief Snapshot Program, and because time is of the essence, and maybe people are going back to work, maybe they're partially in work, partially not, we wanted to be able to provide our UBI program with a shortened monitoring period. So that 30-day period is really important. So we've sent out to our current customers, millions of emails, and for those where we don't have an email, we're sending out actual USPS mail to alert our customers of this offering and make sure that if they are driving less and they do want to receive a discount or their frequency and severity of driving those down, they can opt for this option. We think that's a fantastic addition to the credits that we gave early on, the rate reductions and our road test option for consumers. Yes. I mean I think over the years, we've seen not just our competition that we've had for a long-term, but a lot of the insurtechs going into the space where we feel like we have an advantage, of course, as we buy a large portion of our media in-house, and we make sure that when we acquire a customer that it is under our allowable cost, at or under our allowable costs. And so, I can't go into a lot of proprietary ways with which we do that. But we believe that allows us to have very reasonable acquisition costs, which we believe are much lower than in insurtech. Well, I think all of us try to do the right thing by consumers initially, and so whether it's credits or giveback, et cetera, I think that was an important part. And now for Progressive for sure, we went in surgically to give the discounts I talked about on average 3%, realize that is on average. So we're looking very surgically at each state, channel, and products to give the right discount to make sure we manage that tradeoff between growth and profitability. So, I think that, I'm assuming our competitors are doing similar things. For us, it really is about that balance of growth and profitability, and so we're pretty proud of the fact that in 2020, even with the reduced rates and shopping down substantially during the first part of the pandemic, we were able to grow both in prospects and sales on a full year. So, that's really our concentration. We obviously look across our competitor set to see if prices are down. John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this last February, we look at a few big competitors price rates -- prices are still down, premium is down about 1.7%. And so, yes, I think it will continue to be a challenge to grow, but we are up against that challenge as you can see by our January results. Yes, I'm sure you can appreciate that. I can't go into a lot of details until the transaction closes. But suffice it to say, it gives us access to a larger addressable market and affinity programs, and we were impressed with the culture and the people of Protective. Well, the losses are coming in, and obviously, it was a big storm. And what I can say is that, Gary Traicoff's team is working to kind of understand our ultimate reserves, but I'm confident at this juncture with the data I have that it will pierce our $80 million retention threshold on our reinsurance. We always look where we have not been a big acquirer of companies; we always look at both in terms of do we buy, build or partner. And for the most part, whether it's in private passenger auto, or commercial lines, we've tried to build or buy; depending on if you got to something faster, we prefer to grow organically. Obviously, the ARX acquisition had a lot to do with access to customers; we wanted to be able to have those Robinsons in the agency side. When we looked at acquisitions across the commercial landscape, we thought the Protective 1 got us to a larger addressable market that that we may or may not have gotten to at a certain point. We have a lot of irons in the fire right now, though, on commercial as well in terms of growth. And in fact, over the years, I think we've talked about the horizons. And Horizon Two is our biggest growth opportunity. And so right now our focus is really to continue to grow with our bought product, which I talked about, we just rolled out in 18 states, we went from fleet of less than 10 vehicles to 40 and that continues to grow, small business. And then of course, our relationship with a few different companies and transportation network companies. So that's really our focus. We have so many exciting things going on in Horizon Two to grow. If we see something that makes sense, we'll obviously look at it obviously, I can't talk about that if we would but we really do prefer to grow organically and have done so for the past 80 plus years. Yes. Let me, look, well, I was very satisfied with the property results in January and the fourth quarter. That, of course, does not take up the whole year. And if you take out weather-related, including cash and other weather, we feel like we're in a good position. So we've taken rates up substantially, we've changed our product model; we continue to have deeper segmentation. February is not going to be a great -- February is not going to be a great month for the industry because of the winter storm and we try to obviously put a load in for those events. And last year was another unprecedented year of hurricanes. So I'm happy with the product. I'm happy with our continued ability to segment, I'm happy with the fact that we're growing Robinsons across the board in both direct and agency channel, we've increased our Platinum agents. And I think you're referring to the HomeQuote Explorer, very happy there. So we saw Progressive Home along with many other unaffiliated partners. And that's been higher growth than even the agency channel; we're very excited about that. It's our highest growing segment. And when you think about having customers for life that was really our basis for acquiring ARX is to make sure that we have those auto home bundled one to allow us to extend our auto policy life expectancy. So our retention, of course, is the Holy Grail, but also have those customers for life, so as their needs change, we have them. We didn't want to be the train wheels when people want home. So those customers we see out on toys and life and other products that we're able to offer either on our paper or not. And I'll tell you, although we don't talk about this externally, the policy life expectancy on Robinson versus some of the other segments are extraordinarily higher. And so we're very happy with that growth. And we'll continue to invest in that area. Yes. Well in fact, we're growing bundles even more rapidly on the direct side. And remember those bundles, some of them are with Progressive Home and some are with unaffiliated partners. So we continue to grow both Robinsons and rates in the direct channel. We continue to invest and having the right partnerships to make sure that like John said that we expand our ability to have Robinsons throughout the country and not be so concentrated in the states that -- where there when we first started the acquisition. But we're happy with the growth in the direct side, very happy. We called out that segment. If you recall, we had the Sam Diane, Wright's and Robinsons. The Wright's are where it's our auto policy and another home on affiliate partners. When we first rolled it out, we really sort of went in it with a scarcity model. And as we've grown and developed, we realized that and we want to make sure that when we make the effort to give you the ability to write annual policies and more commission et cetera, that you're able to have Progressive Home and Progressive Audit be like the number one or two choice in your agency. What we realize though, is around the country, there are some places that and some agencies that are really willing and wanting to write Robinsons, but we didn't necessarily make them Platinum agents, because they might be a smaller agency. But what comes in the door, they want to write often with Progressive. And so that's really been the reason and desire, why we've expanded the number of Platinum agents. We lead obviously our 96%, we've talked about this, a fair amount is in aggregate. So we look at the 96% across products, across new and renewal business, across different channels, because the acquisition costs being different. And then we also look at the ROE on every one of our products as well and try to understand how those two interact together. And so although we don't share anything other than the 96%, we keep -- we think about their risk adjusted rate of return as we develop our targets for each of those combined ratios. Yes, again I'm excited to talk about that once we close this transaction and what'll commit to all of you is I'll have in a subsequent quarterly call Karen Bailo, our President of Commercial Lines coming and talk about it. But, we talked about Progressive strengths are in complementary lines of business and coverages for the transportation industry, where we have been successful in the past. And that was a big selling point for us as well as their affinity programs. And that's really all I can say until the transaction closes. It's pretty new. We started offering it in February. I think it's been sent out to maybe 5 million customers, I want to say, so far we've had 9,000 that have gone through and gotten just kind of might be off on a little bit of a number. So it's relatively new. Again, we had to file that. So we're through every state regulators to get that approved. And in some states, you can't do that, we don't have UBI. But we're pretty excited about that because I think really did put, in the hands of our customers, the ability to lower their rates, if they're driving less. We'll have more on that next quarter once it kind of flows through the system. And when you're saying models, are you talking about like the models we look at for weather or overall like our segmentation models internally? Yes. In a sense that actually, we have hired a new risk and reinsurance leader, who was really going to be focusing on, looking at our risk appetite and being more holistic across the enterprise. And then he, what is his big opportunity is to look at is assessing our reliance on models and our usage so a little bit more to come on that. And I think being more planful and coordinated with our placements of reinsurance. So I know it's a little bit off of that, but I know we rely on the Karen Clark model these storms have been pretty unprecedented. I hate using that word again. But the Hurricane season last year was immense in terms of numbers and the numbers that made landfall. And then of course, rarely do you get a winter storm like we had a few weeks ago. So the models generally take those into account. Having somebody with Brandon's depth, I think will really help us to understand and fine tune our reliance on those models. Do you want to add anything, John? Yes. So we just rolled out our 18th stay. And I would say yes, we're at the point where it's our thought process. I'm working with Karen and her team to get more aggressive with because it's an exciting new product. We've obviously invested in it over the last couple of years. So while I can't give you the exact state rollout, I think the word you use is accurate. Would you want to get aggressive with our rollout of BOP as the year progresses. Last year there's so much going on, so much noise in the system we have a lot going on our commercial side, but I know Karen's really excited to move on now. Somewhat not to where it was pre-pandemic and we're watching that really closely. And of course, we have great relationship with both Uber and Lyft. And we work with them on the race and watching that driving behavior. And of course, it differs by state as well, but it's not up to pre-pandemic level. No, that's been increasing over the years, I don't have the exact percentage, I don't know if you do John, but that's been increasing over the years because I think a lot of people shop that way and want buying that way. In fact, we've invested a lot on that with our quoting on HQX and we have more ability than ever to be able to bind and buy online, both auto and home and also on the agency channel. We've had portfolio of quoting, which allows them to do that as well. So one of our strategic pillars is broad coverage be where, when and how customers want to shop. So if I'm on my phone, I want to be able to bind or with an agent or online, so that continues to increase as well. Well, I think, as we talk about our rollouts, whether it's been in Horizon One or Two, I think the product launches are really important. And when we look at what we believe is a strength of ours in industry-leading segmentation, we believe that we'll continue to be a strength of ours. And so we just -- we're finishing our 86 product are in the midst of that, I should say, we rolled out on the auto side 87 in January. And that gives us greater segmentation which is again the right rate for the right risk. And so I think the product models have always been our strengths. We feel the same way on the product side; we're rolling out our NextGen 4.0 product model. And it's always in flux. So we never -- we never say here is a product model, we'll roll it out and not try to make it better, we try to make it better. So there's little we can have, things along the way that will add into the product models once we see if it adds value to get more consumers that are profitable consumers. So that product model period is really important. And it's one of our -- when we think about competitive prices, which of course, this is such a price sensitive industry. Cost and segmentation are a big advantage for us and very important. Yes, I'll add into that with the Robinson a few years ago, we had an internal goal to at some point get a million Robinsons on the book and we're well in excess of that and it just continues to gain momentum. The direct basis is pretty new. So it's on a lower base. And the history would tell you that the majority of our commercial lines have been through the agency channel. We did see a shift in 2020, based on the fact that a lot of agencies were closed. And with our investment in BQX BusinessQuote is for on the direct side, so we have seen a little bit of a shift, the majority of it is still through agents, some of the products can be complex, and people want to be able to have that guidance and that counseling. But we're also innovating and investing for the future to again fulfill our strategic pillar of broad coverage, where, when and how consumers want to shop, including commercial consumer. So while it's still the majority in the agency channel we've invested in and we'll continue, we believe to see increase in small business BOP GL on the direct side. In my opening remarks, I said we had added BOP in the direct side and that happened in fourth quarter last year. Thanks, Elyse. I'll talk a little bit about the calendar effects and then go into how we think about growth. And then John, you can add anything you want. So remember, we have a different calendar, we don't go by the Gregorian calendar. In 2019, if you're looking at new apps in particular, it was a 53-week year and quarter four was a 14-week quarter. So when you look at new app growth, year-to-date or I should say in agency, the fourth quarter was down maybe 1% but it was up on the direct side about 3%. If you look at last year, for the quarter, for quarter three, it was down in agency about 4% and up in direct about 8%. These are new apps in particular. You've seen our retention statistics, we're very proud of the fact that our retention continues to increase. We also know part of that is because of the moratoriums are non-canceled. So we know a portion of that has to do with the pandemic. But we also believe that both what we're doing on the nature and nurture side will continue to reap benefits on the retention side. When I think of growth, we look at obviously PIP growth as our preferred measure because trends are going to change up and down depending on things obviously, the pandemic was dramatic. And we can't, we have to react to our trends. And like I said at the beginning, even though no one took rates up last year, we continued to be able to grow new sales and prospects. How we think about it on the auto side and of course, on both the commercial lines, that I've talked about is we're really going to focus on our four strategic pillars. The first one, our people, our culture, we're going to make sure we have the best work environment ever. People that want to serve our customers, and in turn, they reward us with their loyalty. We're going to focus on our brand. So whether it's mass media, digital, making sure that we send out a message of savings and protection and we continue that this year. I've talked a little bit about competitive prices; we care deeply about costs and taking costs out of the system. So that when people do shop us because they love our brand, we converge. And of course the industry-leading segmentation and I talked about the broad coverage. So we're going to continue to focus on that. And -- we -- this year is going to be again another year where it's going to be really hard to compare because the odds are the denominator in March and April because there was relatively no shopping is pretty low. With that, might come and I don't know exactly when the timing will hit income tax returns more stimulus payments, and we're ready and able to write those consumers. So there's going to be a lot of change. I think what we have to be is well positioned, and nimble as things change. And naturally, what my team and I talked about at time, are we ready for this? And so we'll constantly adjust our rate levels to make sure we're competitive, but also profitable, which is one of our core values. We talked about the different product models that we rollout and some of the other items that we've done, like our Snapshot, Apron and other things to do to make sure our customers are taken care of. I know our CRM organization has something in place right now called more time to pay, where you're really trying to personalize that experience if someone just needs a little bit more time or needs some adjustments on their pay plan, because we know retention is important and we know it's important for our customers. So that's a longwinded answer. And I think there's going to be a lot of variables this year, and a lot of it will depend on as states open, if frequency happens. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen and I think of the last pandemic and when will the roaring 2021 to 2022 see, will people be out driving more? We just have to watch the data, and we're going to react really quickly to it. How much of the book has moratoriums that are non-canceled? I talked about having a new leader in risk and reinsurance. And, partly our property cap program in particular, we were considerate of the minority shareholders in ARX and because upcoming renewal, that's no longer a consideration. So we'll take that in consideration. And as you've noticed, over the years, we've been moving up our retention, we expect our retention in this year's renewal to be at least $100 million. So I know that's a change that is on the books. Other than that, I know Brandon's working with our reinsurers as we come on our renewals. Do you want to add anything?"

            "content": "Mike, to that I would add, you've noted our advertising costs are going up, meaning our spend is going up, and we only spend what we believe it is sufficient. So we have an allowable acquisition cost by segment, and we spend up to that. So generally speaking, if you're seeing our advertising spend go up, you should assume that it's continuing to be very efficient in getting us to the customer set we're after very effectively across all the mediums. So I would say in aggregate at our spend level, we really haven't seen much impact from those newer entrants in the advertising space. And we're taking action, Progressive Home team on profitability. So last year, we took rates up for our property products a 11.5% basically those are annual policies that all hasn't earned in. We've also taken steps to better balance where we're writing homes to ensure our storm risk is diversified. We've taken actions in terms of policy coverage, as well to ensure that our interests are more aligned with our insurers when it comes to storm losses. So I think we've taken a lot of actions that should show benefits coming into this year. I expect we'll continue to take upgrades this year. But as Tricia noted, it's not surprising to know that February would be a tougher start for the year. But again, I think the Progressive Home team has taken the right actions to get profitability where we wanted for home. And as Tricia noted, we're writing a lot more auto because we have home in the agency channel. You know, think of over a billion of very profitable auto insurance that we believe we would not have had through agents we're now for the opportunity to bundle with risk. Gary, just to clarify, you're right to think of the annual policies, just being written by Platinum agents, those are not exclusively Robinsons. They are by far enough away predominately Robinsons, but patients who are Platinum can write annual policies with non-Robinson customers, but it's certainly not part of the majority there. And in direct channel, we do not offer the annual policy for auto. And Gary, we are as you saw close to 4,000 Platinum agents, added a couple 100 this year, probably a bit lower than we would have otherwise, had we not had COVID going on. But if you're wondering if Platinum agents are growing faster than the rest of the agent population, the answer is definitely yes. We won't be able to share that number regularly. But I believe we shared that in a previous Investor Presentation. And I would tell you the trend on terms of relative growth has continued for Platinum agent -- agents excuse me. Yes, just to elaborate a little, we have shared previously in Investor Call relative ranges and combined ratios that we're targeting by each product line and your correct it's not only the severity of claims, but it's generally the volatility and results that drives what relatively speaking the amount of capital, we need to hold against that product line. And we also take into account that there's longer tails in some of those lines. So there are different investing returns across lines of business and bring all that together and generally speaking, target a common ROE. It's not perfect. But those combined ratios that we target by product are definitely driven by our perception of ROE by product line. Go ahead. I was just going to offer generically, we are in complementary lines, in order to write more vehicle business is the way to think about it, right? So for a long time, we said, we weren't going to go into home, we recognized the opportunity through independent agents, where we found that we had to have our own product in order to penetrate the Robinson market and independent agents. So that probably wouldn't have been our preferred route. And we didn't take it until we absolutely saw the necessity to do so to continue to grow rapidly in that vehicle line. So I think you should think about other lines of business to some degree, being complementary in order to continue to grow the business as fast as we can. No, thanks. And just to add to that, we see the change in customer mix as an example, immediately. So we've been predominantly enhancing our segmentation towards the preferred end of the marketplace. And every time we introduce a new product model, we're seeing a furthering shift towards that more Preferred Customer set. So it is a huge part of our business. It's a huge competitive advantage. We believe we've invested a lot to ensure that we're very fast to market when we find new rating variables or underwriting approaches. And again, we see the benefit very quickly in terms of who we're writing and who we're converting at a higher rate. Well most states have lifted the requirement to have moratoriums, I think all states have lifted that, there may be a couple less. But by and large to the extent we're accommodating people who might be behind in payment plans that is our own choice. And it is a fairly small portion of our book at this time. Yes, if you look in the K, you'll see a deeper description of our reinsurance and we did raise our retention this year on the aggregate as well. So Tricia was referring to our retention on named storm coverage. And we also increased our aggregate retention to $475 million, up from $375 million last year, they're also adding to the top of our tower. Some of this is simply because we're growing our total insured value. But we're also as Tricia said, with our new risk and reinsurance leader, getting a little more holistic in terms of our risk appetite, and making some changes upcoming to recognize a little more holistic perspective there. As you might recall, we retained much of the reinsurance program in our property business for years because we had a minority interest there remaining. And their buyout was a function of book value. So there were some interest there in not raising that retention. And obviously at our size and balance sheet, we could raise that and not incur any material risk to our balance sheet."

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and we\u2019ll use this event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, James, and good morning. Although, our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our first, second and third quarter's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of challenges we face. In particular, note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter includes discussions of the risks and uncertainties that we face, including specific risk factors arising directly and indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic and these risks are further referenced in our third quarter 10-Q. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. It was an extremely close and not yet decided election. I thought I'd open with a few words before we get to your questions. I know that the elections are on everyone's mind, including those at Progressive. I think it's important that our shareholders know that we live our core values, specifically the golden rule, regardless of the candidate we support. I'm very proud that in the end, we're all united in our commitment to caring for our customers, our communities, our shareholders, and most importantly for each other. As you know, we feel strongly that our people and our culture are a significant competitive advantage for us. They're one of our four strategic pillars, and we rely on our incredible culture to get us through challenging times, and come out more focused and united than ever. This year has been no different as we move forward together. I thought I'd share a note that I received on Monday from an IT Group manager Scott, regarding a video I did on Unity last week. This really exemplifies who we are as a company and why we win in the marketplace. He said Tricia, I have so much to be thankful for in this year and month and there is a literal pile of things for which I'm deeply appreciative for you and your team, truly, and I know I speak for so many others I am grateful. Then he went on to share the communication that he sent to his team and these are words that are echoed by so many leaders at progressive. His note said, it's the last Tuesday in October, which means that next week marks the national election and another end to political yard sign season. Here's the sign we placed in our own yard. And the sign started with love your neighborhood it talked about loving your neighbor regardless of race, who you love, et cetera. Conveying what we've hoped for our neighborhood, that regardless of next week's outcome, we hope that our common bond as neighbors can prevail over the differences, really an extension of the golden rule. That's not to say that it's not easy or that we\u2019re not strong in our political convictions, but it's also to say that we strive to respect, care for and even love our neighbors regardless of their vote or other differences. The same applies here at work with Progressive culture rooted in our core values. My DRG is committed -- direct reporting group is committed to support the diversity of our people. Please work to grow and sustain that spirit of collegiality and friendship with each other through and beyond the election. And these words really truly reflect who we are as a company and you know, being up late and in the middle of the night and this morning, I will end up after this call shooting another video today to ensure The Progressive people who may feel stressed, remain calm and focused, even though there'll be delayed results. Also, tomorrow marks our Eighth Annual Keys to Progress, where we give away cars to deserving veterans. Due to restrictions on business operations for the program participants and social distancing requirements, our giveaway events will be small, but still very meaningful. All-in-all, this is another great example of giving back to our communities where we've donated over 750 vehicles in the past eight years. Being a successful business starts with our people and this quarter continues to exemplify what you can do with the right team and the right culture. As I stated in my letter, we're extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We're also acutely aware that these times are tumultuous and that we have to remain nimble as events unfold. That's really always been our strong suits. Thank you. And with that James will take the first question\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please, your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, first question, I'd love to learn more about the automobile severity trends. They seem to kind of -- be kind of staying higher for longer by -- I know there is a lot of -- there's been some noise and distortions during COVID, you called some out in the Q and in the quarter, you've called some out to about subrogation. I'm trying to -- kind of just learn more. So we can kind of understand whether the underlying trend might be a little bit lower or if this is kind of the new normal, especially in the bodily injury and pip sides?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Mike. Yes, let me give you some insight and it\u2019s a little bit difficult to compare with PCI because they haven't reported Q2 yet. They're not as volatile as Q2, but let me go through a couple. So, when you think of PD -- it's sort of the opposite of what happened in Q2 in terms of inbound subrogation. Our supplement payments, which is inbounds sub are coming from a period of lower volume applied to a period of an increase in current volume. So, we report 3.9%, PD incurred. It's a little bit higher, if you remove that inbound sub, about four points higher. So, right around 8.5 points. So, it's a little bit higher, but clearly less than Q2 when we were at 12.7. On collision, again the outbound sub mix is no longer driving trends. And that's of course, the money we receive in. And if you remove that sub percentage, this 6.2 goes up a little bit, that was negative in Q2. So that was very different. And it's all really about the numerator and denominator when you're having frequency changes quarter-to-quarter. You talked about BI, our incurred severity is similar to Q2. So, we have some aging, which we believe accounts for about two points. And then we have another one point to two points that relates to facts of loss -- loss shift. So, what we did was we took a look at quarter two of 2019 facts of loss, and then we compared that to quarter two of 2020 facts of loss. And what we're seeing, we think this is likely because of less morning congestion commute, that there are less rear end accidents. So, think I'm kind of a fender bender, that wouldn't cause much damage from a severity perspective or an injury perspective. There are more intersection accidents, which are always more severe. So our estimates take into account the aging inflation and the facts of loss, mix shift, we believe is around 7% to 8%. So while we are reporting the 11.6%, we believe it's a little bit lower based on those two issues. So PIP so difficult because there's so many different state mix changes. And in the severity \u2013 the higher severity space account for about two points of with those mix shifts. So we think that aside from New York most of the PIP states are around 6% to 7% severity. So it's not as volatile. It's still different just because of the situation with COVID and vehicle miles traveled and different loss patterns. But hopefully that will give you some insight into our severity trends.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Yes. That's very helpful. I guess, lastly, I'll move just more broadly to the direct-to-consumer segment of auto. It feels like there's been an acceleration of PIP. And I think the only question we get whether is \u2013 whether this is kind of the new normal or if there's kind of been a temporary bump during COVID. I'm trying to \u2013 I know it's a high-level question. Just trying to better understand is do you feel that there's something helping you guys that's kind of one-off that could kind of kind of taper off a little bit or is there third-party marketing technologies you guys are using and just will continue to help you? Anything to kind of get us better? I think we understand from your letter Tricia you guys feel great about growth. Just trying to get a sense of whether the double-digit growth in direct-to-consumers is sustainable? \nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean on the auto side in the private passenger auto side when we market, we're marketing for the direct side but we believe that our agents are reciting to that. So when the stay-at-home orders happened, a lot of our agents weren't able to actually work or open their branches, some of them obviously were able to do it from their home but we saw applications go down. And now we're seeing them increase a little bit as things start to open. So that could be volatile for a while depending on what happens with rates of infection. What I will say is that the direct-to-consumer side really has increased on the commercial side. So our commercial business has always been the majority from the agents. It's a more complicated product and we are seeing more direct-to-consumer on the commercial side. That trend likely would have been happening over time as people felt comfortable with the products they're buying it really depends on complexity. But I will say that in our for-hire transportation, it's the strongest our direct channel where those new ventures are coming in directly to Progressive. So it's hard to say if it will continue. It could be what's happening with pandemic, it could be what's happening with younger truckers for example, starting new ventures and they're more comfortable going direct. But what I would say is we're glad that we've invested in the direct side of the business. We continue to feel like we want to have broad coverage for where when and how customers want to buy and just be available for everyone depending on that need.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nJohn Sauerland: I just might add Mike, you use the new normal in both the severity and the direct questions. And we aren't thinking there's any new normal to point out right now. It's a very dynamic environment obviously, but we think we're playing a well. So in the direct space, as you noted in the Q advertising is up a 29% for the quarter. So when you see us spending more in advertising you should know that we are seeing opportunities to spend efficiently to bring in business. That is what we call the prospects side of the equation and prospects are up as we noted in the Q about 8% for the quarter, but conversion is up as well. And that was a quarter where some of our competitors had lower pricing in effect because of their approach to COVID rebates or credits and some of those have come off now. So from a competitiveness standpoint all else equal, we think we're in a pretty good place. Conversion is up 5% for the quarter. We may even be getting more competitive. So again all else equal, our advertising especially being even more effective.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question was just in the Q, you guys did pointed out that miles driven went up in the first half of the third quarter, but then back down in the second half. So I was just wondering if we could get some color on what you think might have driven that? I'm not sure if it was pickup in COVID cases or partial lockdowns in certain states? Or anything -- any other color that you think would apply to that dynamics within the third quarter?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. We do think that's what happened. We think that is reflected pretty when something changes in a given state. We look at this from state-to-state. There's really a variety of vehicle miles traveled and ranges. It\u2019s still now much obviously higher than the trough of 40% right around 10%-ish 10% to 15% across the country. We're really digging in to kind of understand it. We do see the congestion is still a very different in the morning to me where there's less congestion. We're starting to dig into how we look at the types of job you have, and so we can try to understand people that might work-from-home for a longer period of time versus people that have jobs where you need to be on about. And in fact we're really looking through our UBI data that are Robinsons or people that are 65 and older their features fell in line with their vehicle miles traveled and we just think they're driving less during rush hour or they're working from how more they have roles that can work from home they might be retired. And the younger demographics what we would call the spends and dines and wrights their features fell more than the VMC, although the gap is narrowing. And they had a small drop in mileage. We believe that these are jobs that can't be done from home. So we're watching that closely. I think a lot depends on what happens in the next several weeks with infection rates and what specific states do. So again what we'll do is we continue through our product group watching those states and those areas very closely to understand those frequency trends and using data both on the Snapshot side and the smart hall side in commercial where we're not seeing that change. So the truck drivers are on the road more because of moving goods back and forth. So we see a little bit different on the commercial side. And even though the congestion has decreased, we know that they're on the road more. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. It's changing always and we're thankful that we have a lot of data in our usage-based insurance across many of our products and we'll keep watching that and react as necessary.\nElyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then my second question is on Snapshot. So I was hoping that you could give us an update on kind of the take-up rates within both the agency and the direct side where we sit today. And then have you guys noticed a greater take-up rate for your Snapshot devices during this kind of COVID slowdown, I guess is folks are potentially driving less right, with potentially want to use a device that could potentially lead to some savings to them?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So immediately, we've always had a pretty good high take rate on the direct side. So immediately, when we had the shutdown, we saw an uptick in that. And that sort of leveled off. On the agency side where we haven't had historically a great of a take rate, we saw that go up, and it's continues. So I think, agents and I've been -- I probably talked in one of the great things about COVID is that, I've been able to get out and talk to literally thousands of agents in the last couple of months, virtually, of course, and they understand that they need to be competitive, and they've been talking and selling Snapshot to their clients, to our mutual clients. And so that has increased and that has continued to kind of maybe level out, but it's increased much more than before COVID. On the commercial side, September was the biggest Smart Haul enrollment ever and the monthly take rate climbed to about 24%. So we're seeing that definitely on the commercial side. John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Sauerland: Yeah. So that's definitely seeing that take rates go higher, especially in the for-hire transportation segment that Tricia was noting earlier. So that is, you can think of sort of delivery trucks, as well as interstate trucking. And we're very excited to see especially the take rate on what we call new ventures. So a lot of truckers are going out on their own these days. And truck insurance premiums are pretty high. So they're very open to offers that might lower that premium. And it's great that the take rate there is even higher than the overall. And we feel that segment is very well priced, especially when we have the Smart Haul insights that we have really from day one. So the other thing, I would mention on Snapshot more generally is that we are -- well, we haven't marketed a lot, we have something called Snapshot Road Test in market now. And the take rate there is encouraging. And this is via mobile devices whereby you can do what we used to call test drives. So if you drive for a while, we get your driving behavior, we deploy that at your initial quote. Today in Snapshot, we give you a discount for participating and then give you the fully developed discount at renewal with Road Test. You get that up front. So we're excited by the early take rates there again, we have a marketed it, but we think we're ready to do consumers will be very interested.\nElyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And will Road Test, thank you to proceed follow-up, will Road Test be available in all states where you have the traditional Snapshot product?\nJohn Sauerland : Yeah. So it's available today. We just haven't marketed it.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar, with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on the competitive environment and you just discussed sort of pricing conditions in the personal auto business and your outlook for margin, because it does seem like the more and more companies are trying to be more proactive and trying to either gain share or recover the share that they've lost over the last few years?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, we feel really great. We've added 2.4 million policies compared to last September. So we feel like we were well positioned coming into the pandemic. And then we reacted very quickly. So we knew that vehicle miles travel has been down. We immediately gave to 20% credits for two months to our auto customers. We feel that that -- it could change, so that helped us with retention, because those customers were able to say, obviously, there were some moratoriums as well and they'll have to play out depending on what happens, if there's stimulus, et cetera. And then we started to do what we do best and surgically look at state by state, channel by channel, product by product, because we want to balance that growth and profitability. And we've really enjoyed gaining share across the board and we want to continue that. So what we're doing now is, what we call, taking small bites of the apple in terms of rate decreases. If we see conversions going down or we're less competitive and we get a lot of intel from other companies and our agents, we will take rates down slightly. So we talked about taking it down about 1 percentage for the quarter and 3% April through September. We did that in about 37 states and when I say 37 states, there might have been two rate decreases, maybe 0.5% maybe 1%. We really watch this and we're able to react so quickly, which keeps us really competitive when people are shopping. And then, April through December, we will have taken some form of rate decrease in about 42 states and that is about 84% of our country-wide net written premiums. So, again, surgically being able to react to rate, be competitive. And we do that going both ways, depending on the product. But we feel like we're positioned well, like John said, and everybody had whether they took credits or discount, everyone's trying to make sure that we are competitive. This is a very competitive industry and we feel like we're in a really good position, which is why I started the letter off the way I did. I'm very pleased with our results and our reaction to COVID and what we've been able to do for our customers when they need us the most.\nJimmy Bhullar: And when you think about this balancing growth and profitability, is there a level on either the loss ratio or the combined ratio to where you're comfortable taking it up and continuing to push for growth? Like, I think, in the past you've talked about mid-90s would be a level where you've sort of slow down your growth and focus more on margins instead?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we've had the same objective in the company since we went public in 1971, that to grow as fast as we can and make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so, we always try to balance that. That said, we have five core values and one of them is profit. So if we don't believe we can be profitable then we'll start growing, profit comes first. So, here's the deal. We don't want to give away margin. So if we believe that we can grow and still grow at that 96 or less than a combined ratio, we'll do so. If we don't, we'll keep the margin and understand that again, that is as such, we do it at such a surgical level, that the 96, grow as fast as you can, is our job objective for the overall company but we look at it very different across our portfolio. So, yes, we're going to continue to try to aggressively grow, gain market share all while making sure that we achieve our profitability goal.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. So the first question will be around retention. As you know, there was another insurtech company that went public groups. It's also an Ohio-based company. They disclose their retention rates, Allstate discloses their retention rates. And I'm just curious if you could give us some color about how your retention has been this year, relative to last year?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, so retention for us is really the Holy Grail, you want -- you spend the money to acquire customers, they come in, you want to make sure we give great service and they reward us with the retention. So, we look at retention for what we call policy life expectancy. On the trailing 12 months, it's up to 9%, up 10% of agency, 7% indirect. Now, the caveat is we're getting a benefit of the billing leniencies and moratoriums and so we would say -- we would say that those are the numbers, but they may be conservative, depending on what happens with people and jobs and unemployment, etcetera. Our trailing three is a little bit lower and a little bit more volatile. Trailing three is 7% up, up in 6% in agency 8% indirect.  And on the commercial line side, of course, we look at a 12 month basis because those are annual policies; PLE is up about 4%. So, we're very pleased with that, but we also know that there's a lot of volatility going on right now. And we'll do our best to keep our customers and to work with them, our CRM, our customer relationship management group on both the direct side auto and commercial lines auto, work very close to the customers if they need to make changes to their policy in order to keep their coverage available. So, I would say the PLE numbers that we state that we stayed in the queue are very positive. But we also know a part of that is because of the lenient scene moratorium on based on COVID.\nGreg Peters: Got it. The second question is around the expense ratio, a number of your competitors are laser-focused on reducing their expense ratios to bring them down closer to your level. And I'm curious about the initiatives that you have ongoing within your company to keep your expense ratios low and possibly to get them lower.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, we talk about expense ratios all the time. And we're pretty proud of our results. It's a balance, of course, making sure that we're investing in things like digital that our customers need. I think the one of the silver linings of the pandemic is that we learned that we can write really good estimates from photos and videos and we were working on that prior to the pandemic. But obviously, it was exacerbated based on the fact that we all you know kind of went into our homes to do the work. So, we continue to experiment and see what type of vehicles that we can look at and not be side of car and understand, is that is a quality estimate. Because you don't want to have such a as an example such a low loss expense ratio or loss expense adjustment ratio, if your accuracy is not good, because that indemnity is the biggest part of what we pay out.  And we continue to work in our CRM organization, understand how customers can get things they need without human intervention. John Sauerland\u2019s Group is working on, some RPA process. And so there's, we have a lot of things going around the company, we're actually we had, we had completed a five year plan for a Board of Directors last year. And obviously we're redoing it this year, because a lot of the changes and that's actually been a topic of what we're what we try to achieve.  We have internal goals that we work on together. And we balance that with investments of like John said, advertising, digital, but we constantly try to look good. How can we absolutely do more with less than not affect our customers? And we know that this is a competitive industry, and that competitive prices are really important. So that expense ratio is a big part of it whether it's on the overall side or decline side. John you're the first string holder you want to add any color?\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. Certain many competitors are aspiring to our level of cost structure but there are some competitors who have better cost structures than progressive. So we've been focused on continuing to get more competitive in terms of cost structure for years. As Tricia noted, we think of it in two buckets. So we think of what we call non-acquisition expense ratio and acquisition expense ratio. In the acquisition, we put advertising, as well as agents commission, so I just mentioned earlier, advertising for the quarter was up 25%. It was up 20% year-to-date. We think that's good growth in expenses because we're acquiring customers we're going to have for a long time. Similarly on the agent side, we have to pay competitive commission in order to continue to grow there. So we think growth in expenses in that portion of the expense ratio is good. We focus on the non-acquisition expense ratio, where we are trying to drive what we think of as our infrastructure costs lower. And if you go back around five years, as Tricia noted, I think we've taken out maybe close to three or four points on our non-acquisition expense ratio and we \u2013 our site set on reducing that further is as Tricia noted, price competitiveness is not the only thing that matters in the marketplace but it is a very big part of the consideration set for auto and home insurance as well as commercialize especially.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for the answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Hey, good morning. So we've all heard Elon at Tesla talk about being aggressive with hiring actuaries and starting on insurance company to use his proprietary real-time data and \u2013 well maybe that's only for is captive fleet I guess just your thoughts on how you view the competition from connected car companies like that that do have really access to rich data from their own fleet to offer insurance to complete fleets?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think that we \u2013 from a talent perspective, we feel really positive where we're at. We do \u2013 we have been investing in understanding how to have functionality to gather data from third parties whether it be OEs and we call it Express data quote. So that will be something that we're working on now. I mean I think the question is \u2013 or the answer is that yes, the talent is important. We believe that at some point we'll have to answer who owns the data but we've been working on this with a lot of partners over time to understand how to get quotes our way and understand that data to better understand trends. Does that answer your question? \nMichael Phillips: So I guess, I was looking more towards your view of just the competitive landscape from companies like that that have access to their own data from fleet are trying to offer insurance and even there aggressively offer their insurance. I know how we speaks but that was really what I was trying to get at.\nTricia Griffith: Got it. Yes I wasn't sure if I answered that. Yes, it's great competition. We have had \u2013 they have shot in data for a long, long time. And so we feel very comfortable. The fact that I could be able to tell you today, I think when Elisa answered the question that our Robinson cohort, the feature is sell in line with vehicle miles traveled, et cetera, we're able to watch that real time. And especially, now I'm very excited about what we're doing now on the commercial side and I talked about that with the floor higher transportation to be able to give these discounts to those delivery trust, those trust drivers interest and understand the best drivers are really important. That will help with retention. That will help with loss cost. So the competition is great, because it allows us to never stop evolving. So years ago we only had the dongle and you had to plug it in and then you could do a wireless. Now we have the mobile device. John talked about our road test. We have Snapshot Proview. So it forces us in a really good way to continue to invest data and collecting data on our 24 plus million policyholders. So we feel like we're in a really great position and competition only makes us better. \nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks. I guess part two then is, you alluded to it here and we talked a lot about UBI and Telematics now. I guess, what's the lifeline of credit score specifically as a rating variable on personal auto? Are we looking at a couple of years? Do you think that thing dries up or decades? Or how long does I think have left in runway the pricing Varel? \nTricia Griffith: You know what? That's -- I'm glad you brought that up, because I -- we've been thinking about that a lot. And I know there's been -- there will be challenges because of the pandemic on regulatory issues. So Michael this would be a lot longer answer than you probably want. But I think it's really important for me to make a couple of points. Basically on risk based pricing and then on kind of what's happening in the world. So first and foremost, we've been getting questions on the usage of credit specifically, does it affect race. And race is never used in pricing insurance projects. In fact it's illegal. A few people have the exact same risk profile. If there's a person that's just like me, same driving, same credits, and we happen to be different races, we get the same rates. Basically we are risk base and race lined. And I also want to make sure that it's clear that progressive supports legislative and regulation that enables insurers to leverage all the available data technology and advanced analytics to price insurance risks when it reflects the insurance cost. And that's really key, we want to have a rate for the specific risk. And for me it's -- for us it's about accuracy, and it allows people and consumers and small business owners to fulfill their American dream and achieve their economic opportunities that they desire. We've talked a lot in the past about the virtuous cycle. If you've got rating accuracy at least a broader consumer availability and affordability, which leads to growth and financial success not just for our shareholders but for the company and for job creation. We've been able to create so many jobs in the last several years, that leads to innovation and segmentation and then goes back to rating accuracy. So we've had that the virtuous cycle that we've been very proud of. And in the past, we've talked about \u2013 it\u2019s the regulator's role to work with us closely in the industry to ensure solvency, ensure compliance and facilitate healthy and competitive markets that provide a wide variety of options for consumers. So key elements that I've mentioned before to focus on is ensuring that at prices for insurance are not inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. So we're strong advocates for healthy, competitive volunteer insurance and broad distribution. And for the U.S. insurance industry, we want to be able to continue to facilitate the risk taking in transfer that drive economic growth through delivering products that are both available and affordable. So for us we --in the industry we believe ,we want to preserve the sanctity of contract and the continued support for risk-based pricing. Now all that said, we do recognize that for some individuals mandatory insurance protection can be a significant financial burden. We're very open to collaborating with regulatories and other regulators and other industry leaders on solutions for those individuals versus creating massive and unnecessary market disruption that will likely have a negative outcome for certain segments. So that's sort of my feel on, why we've continued to support risk-based pricing which credit is one variable of many. I think how we think about affordability challenges and we just have to think about where we're at in the time of history and decisions that we make that affect the future for consumers. So if you go back to our route in 1937. I'm very proud of Progressive. We started out as the nonstandard insurer allowing people in Cleveland Ohio who couldn't get insurance be able to do that. And then of course you know they're rust eventually countrywide. And we're able to have access to affordable protection across many segments. We have a critical role, I believe in inviting innovation segmentation and the use of technology and data to provide greater access to competitively priced insurance for all. We shouldn't confuse affordability challenges that many face during this unprecedented pandemic with our long standing and solvent model of providing affordable and widely available protection. I think the issues that have arisen regarding social injustice couldn't stem from the insurance industry they've been looming for decades and the events this year brought them to the surface. And now I think we need to really get together and ultimately solve the root problem of opportunity and equality for all not just during the pandemic, but ongoing. So from my perspective and this list could go on and I'll shut up, but very short term after the elections decided we need some form of stimulus to get us through this next wave of infections. And my hope is that, we're able to distribute it more surgically this time to those that need it most. I believe that we need to raise the minimum wage over time to $15 per hour. I will note that all active Progressive employees already make over $15 an hour and we're proud of that. And as a country our focus should really be on additional funding. So the schools can safely reopen and deliver effective online communication. You can't get ahead. If you don't have the ability to learn online which requires infrastructure investments like access to broadband coverage. So I could go on and on, but the message here is that, we as a country are facing a really great opportunity to make substantive changes. And as an insurance company we'll continue to play a role in focusing on rational and risk-based solutions so that everyone is able to achieve the economic opportunities they desire. I've been obviously thinking about that a lot Michael. So I'm glad you brought it up. I think that credit is a powerful variable. It is it is not race related. We do not believe it's race related and we'll continue to hold firm on them. \nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nGary Ransom: Yes, good morning. Tricia you mentioned in your letter the creative ways of treating customers and we also saw how ad spend is up and direct quotes were up. And I just wondered in looking at the success of all that's going in and getting customers into the funnel and successfully getting a new customer. What are the actual key elements of success in attracting those customers either today in this COVID environment or what you're seeing over the longer term? \nTricia Griffith: Well I think ultimate success Gary is to be able to acquire customer at/or below our targeted acquisition cost. But more importantly, as we look at and expand our product line, we're able to do so with our creatives. So for years we had flow inside the superstore, the whole message is savings, savings, savings. And now we have obviously and entire network of characters that talked about savings, but also talk about protection for your home. And we're seeing that work. An example is, I don't know if you've seen it or not, we have had this campaign for a few years and we've settled it on a character called Dr. Rick which is Parentamorphosis as you become your parents when you buy your first call. I think that a lot of people can relate to that. We're seeing the results of that do really well. We've done a couple of good campaigns with the Cleveland Browns quarterback and market to guys that due the 10-yard line chains that we are able to play during the live sports wishes, which is what everyone's watching now until we go back to regular television. So we look at what we call new prospects that haven't shopped us in the last six months. And then we look -- from that we look at do they convert and at what cost. And all those things lead us to understand when the creative works, when it doesn't, when it does we double down and get deeper in the campaign. When it doesn't, we move on and get more creative. So during COVID, I'm really proud of our marketing department, because everything is shut down. And initially we did some nice campaign stories that were softer, because everyone was sort of just nervous about what was happening, because it was so new. And now we're really doing a lot that we're kind of moving forward. But even in the meantime we did really creative opportunities where we had flow and her whole squad, that we call it, on a Zoom call, et cetera. We really got creative to make sure that we didn't miss a step. We know this is a competitive environment and we wanted to continue to be on consumer shortlist, out and available, thinking of Progressive when they go to shop.\nGary Ransom: Maybe extending that into the agency channels also, where I think your conversion rates were up as well. Usually that just means your price is lowest on the comparative raters there. But is there more to it than that as well? Are they -- are you seeing more coming into the agents? Is there -- are there agents\u2019 incentives or other things going on there? \nTricia Griffith: Yes. We occasionally do agent incentives. It may be, based on things like UBI and if we see something that we want them to do more. We, over the years, have changed some of the agency commission structures depending on if you're selling preferred, Robinsons, auto, home bundled those agents to platinum agents get more commission. They're allowed to have 12-month policies on the auto side, so we're giving them that. And we've done a lot in our platinum agency to have incentives based loss ratio and other things. So we didn't always do those in the past. Our relationship with our agents has really changed in a very positive way. Like I said at the beginning, I've been able to talk to a lot of agency agents. Just not long ago I had our top 25 platinum agents. Usually we do something with them. We obviously couldn't this year. So while we'll keep our overall commission level about the same rate, we have bifurcated and we'll give you a different commission based on the incoming type of customer, which we believe is the long-term value of that customer. So, obviously, cost matters a lot, brand matters a lot, commission matters a lot. And probably the last thing I would say and coming from the claims organization, agents are always so happy to not have to deal with any complaints, because our claims organization is so stellar. So there's a lot that goes into it. Clearly, cost is one of them. They benefit from our brand. But, yes, we have -- we do incentives and we have different commissions based on the type of customer that we get in namely preferred. \nJohn Sauerland: I just elaborate on Tricia's last point Gary to say ease of use. So, price competitiveness is extremely important. Ease of use is almost as important in my perspective. So, as Tricia noted not having to deal with hassles on the back end with a claim for sure, but front end as well. So, we've invested heavily in technology to make quoting and now quoting the household in our agents easier. And that will definitely help drive business to Progressive as well. \nTricia Griffith: Yes, I think this month or last month we finished full rollout of portfolio quoting. So, the agent feedback is extraordinary. Just you got to make it easy. Thanks Gary.\nGary Ransom: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good morning. I actually want to continue on this last line of questions. With regards to the kind of creative ways to reach out of consumers beyond the ease of use and quotes and the innovative ad spend in the traditional channels are there any new ways to get to market? Any ways that you're exploring maybe Internet social media and then relate to get our customers? \nTricia Griffith: Yes. When I usually speak about marketing I go to sort of the mass media and that's one portion of how we market media. We're on streaming. So, we advertise on Hulu. We advertise on most of the social network, channels, and affiliates on Internet. So we -- and we have generic search. So there -- we have a variety of ways to make sure we get our message to you and do everything we can to get our message to you the right number of times not too much not too little because we don't want to bog you down. So, yes, there's -- besides the creative also many different ways. And there's sometimes on a digital platform that will have characters that we don't even have on mass media. And it's usually the specific demographic that we're looking for in that channel. So, yes, we a variety of ways. And as things change with how people watch TV or watch streaming, we'll continue to play a part of that. And the great part is we have access to so much data to understand pretty quickly if it's working so we can remove it or double down.\nYaron Kinar: And are there any metrics you can share on that in terms of are you increasing your spend in those kind of non-mass media channels? Is the take-up greater or improving there? \nTricia Griffith: I think John wanted to say something to be yes. We're increasing the spend in those channels for sure because many people have cut the cord and don't watch any TV so we need to have access to them through those different channels. John do you want to add to on?\nJohn Sauerland: Yes, the growth in spend in nontraditional media has outpaced traditional for years now and we're constantly testing into new media where we can. We have a group that entirely focuses on new ways to reach people. And the overarching philosophy is where when and how consumers want to buy. So, we are definitely investing. And normally I think relatively speaking on the forefront of trying new channels and ensuring that we can actually measure the success of those new channels. So, we are very disciplined that we're out spending new money that we find ways to measure its effectiveness and I think that differentiates us relative to a lot of other marketers.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then my second question it goes to one of the arguments that we hear from insurtech, which is that traditional insurers even innovative and successful ones like Progressive ultimately face an innovator's dilemma in the form of how much you push telematics based scoring and pricing because of the legacy blocks. And that these insurtech as a result could have an advantage over the incumbents over time because they're not encumbered by legacy blocks. So I'd love to maybe hear a little more about how Progressive looks at the innovators dilemma and how it handles the right balance between pushing these creative and innovative ways to price in and score versus maintaining the legacy block?\nTricia Griffith: And I talked a little bit about that, when I talked about the virtuous cycle in terms of when you have a segment, you innovate, et cetera and you do that. I think that insurtech are serving a great purpose in terms of ease of use and it would be I think, easy to be able to or nice to be able to I should say start without having legacy systems. That's said we have them, we work around them but we don't say okay, we're just going to be here in time and try to work around. We're constantly innovating from a technology perspective, ease of use perspective. And we believe that part of our DNA is really innovation. We've been first in a lot. I won't go into naming that and we don't intend to change that. And the great benefit that we have that the insurtechs don't is the cost of acquisition. And for us we're going to continue to hone on in \u2013 hone in on that. And that's why we were able to increase our policies $2.5 million in one year. That's the reason we're able to do so and make our target profit margins, which are also very important. We have shareholders that are \u2013 that own us because they know we're committed to our 96th growth fast you can. We don't have the \u2013 the availability to say we're going to test things, regardless if we make money or not. So we're very innovative. We're always going to do everything we can to make a profit one of our core values and we're able to leverage our size to have lower acquisition costs.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. Just sort of following on along the lines of this \u2013 the unique ways of \u2013 or new ways to acquire customers. I was hoping maybe you could expand a bit on any distribution partnerships for the personal auto business that you may have with the OEMs or online car sites like vroom.com that you have or that you might be exploring. I know that Ford has just entered an agreement with Veris Data Exchange to help offer insurance. I'm wondering do you have any of these relationships? Is this something that you're exploring as a new way to acquire customers? And just sort of how you view that I guess subchannel of the DTC market? \nTricia Griffith: Thanks, David. Yes we've worked with many different OEs over the years and I talked a little bit about that Express a quote that will give us the functionality to work with OEs and other aggregators. We do \u2013 we have many relationships and we have some in the works that I'm not liberty to talk about right now. John?\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. So we've worked directly with OEs over the years. We started a relationship with GM. I can't remember how many years ago now, probably four years ago. As you know to get the data directly from vehicles and offer rates that are reflective of driving behavior at the point of quote and the point of sale. We have also worked with aggregators of that data or third-party gatherers of that data. So there are apps on your phone that are tracking where you're going and how you're driving and we've worked with those entities as well. It is a funnel as we think of it. When we talk about funnel economics, the number of people that come in the top there versus the number that come out of the bottom meaning actually buy a policy has been challenging. That is not to say we won't continue and are continuing to test in that space. And in new media, we normally see funnel challenges at the outset and we work through the experience to continue to refine it, and continue to make it better and to get to the point where the funnel economics work for us. So we've been testing into the data direct from OEs in numerous manners for a number of years now and have shown some success but not to the point that it will be a considerable portion of our media spend anytime soon frankly.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And so it sounds like those are interesting, but the conversion rates are still below your other direct channels. Is that correct characterization?\nJohn Sauerland: That's a fair way to think about it. And think of conversion not only as you got to quote and you then bought the policy, but getting folks from interested in the whole process even to get to the core process. So it's a longer funnel than just got the quote, bought the policy. Then when we talk about in conversion percentage that's what we're talking about there. This is we think of the entire funnel efficiency.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then just switching gears just more broadly it's obviously been a profitable year for you guys, notwithstanding, the credit and other actions that you've taken. Just wondering, how we should think about the variable dividend? And I guess how you guys are thinking about that as we approach the end of the year?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. So we meet with the investment committee John and I and Jon Bauer, our Head of Progressive Capital Management throughout the year understanding our capital strength, which is very strong and always thinking about some dry powder for anything that might come up. We've had a couple of sessions that we have a range that we're thinking about. Obviously the Board will be the one that decides that. We meet with them at the beginning of December and we'll talk through something and get more in line with what we believe the dividend will be payable next year. So obviously that's an unknown because it will be a Board's decision. We feel really great about our capital position. We feel great about our growth and our profit. And we -- in the past, we've been able to share that with our shareholders. Again, we don't have any specific amount I can share with you, but we feel really great about our year. Anything can happen. There's still a few months left but we feel good.\nJohn Sauerland: We have approximately five minutes left in the call and still have a handful of people in the queue. We will go through the last handful here and go a little bit long. However, we will limit everybody to a single question. if you have additional question, you may contact the Investor Relations group at the contact information on the website. With that, I'll hand it back over to James.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. And thanks so much for accommodating us. I was hoping that either Tricia or John, could talk us through sort of the monthly volatility in the commercial lines expense ratio and what's been going on there?\nA \u2013 John Sauerland: So whenever we're looking at results, you should expect volatility. Let me start there in terms of loss ratio, as well as the expense ratio. In our commercialized business, we talked about non-acquisition expense ratio previously. We have actually been growing our expense ratio in our commercial business and that's been intentional and plan-ful because we're investing for future growth. Specifically, business owners program, we're now in 13 states and are feeling great about our progress there so far. We would like to get basically to the entire country with that program because we think it effectively triples our addressable marketing like commercialize business. We've also invested heavily in what we call our small business insurance initiative, which is essentially the direct platform for commercialized business. And our BusinessQuote Explorer, which -- HomeQuote Explorer makes it very easy to get quotes from a variety of carriers through our direct platform there. So we have long-term plans to bring that expense ratio on a commercial lines business back down. But in the near-term, it's going to be slightly elevated from where we've been. That said, on a relative basis relative to our competitors, meaning we're very competitive cost structure in a commercialized business. But if you're looking for commentary, specifically on the expense ratio, loss ratio for the month, we encourage you to look a little longer term, at least for the quarter.\nA \u2013 Tricia Griffith: And what I would say Meyer is that this was very specifically planned several years ago when we set forth the three Horizon concept. We saw some opportunities in Horizon to mostly around commercial Auto and BOP and TNC and small business and fleet. And so, we knew that in order to invest there we had to have some money -- put some money into it. And now we're seeing the fruition of that investment. So we believe it will come down over time as we have more broad coverage with these products, but we feel very good about that spend because we felt like there was an opportunity in that addressable market for us to do many new and different things to solidify. Again our commercial auto with even more products. And the pandemics been a little bit odd for small businesses, but we feel positive about that going forward in our ability to win and with that bought product on both the agency and direct side. \nMeyer Shields: Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open. \nQ \u2013 Brian Meredith: My question. Chris if I look at average written premium per policy for your personal auto business it went from plus 1, 2Q to minus 2 in 3Q. Just curious is that, all due to the rate actions you've been taking or are you seeing any changes in customer buying habits i.e. higher deductibles, lower limits those types of things that may be having an impact on that as well? \nTricia Griffith: I would say the majority of that is our reduction in premiums. I haven't seen too much of a change in our business mix profile. \nQ \u2013 Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for taking my questions, so late in the call. I'm just wondering if we can compare shopping and JV right now when compared to where it was three years ago. I've tended to believe that when prices are going up, Progressive's seasonal shop, ever, because people are unsatisfied. But now that prices are going down, maybe people widely know that there's progress to be had in auto insurance and so it might stimulate a decent amount of buying. And if you can add, is there a difference between the shopping behavior, people seeking just an auto policy and people seeking an auto and home policy?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. That's so hard, Josh, to look at and compare it three years ago. I do think that, even when prices are going down in this environment, it might be different. And this is -- I hate to use the word, it's still unprecedented. It really depends on the situation with the consumer and what they're looking for in terms of, did somebody get furloughed or waived off, et cetera. So I think it's hard to know. And what we really focus on is making sure that have the message out there that we have that broad coverage that we have. The ability to measure our acquisition costs and now that they're under our targeted amount to get the customer in there. So it's really hard for me to say. I think what we've tried to do is just, when they are shopping regardless of the reason, we're available, we're easy and we're competitively priced. Do you want to add anything? \nJohn Sauerland: Yes. So I agree with Tricia. There are many different metrics around shopping behavior and they don't always agree. As Tricia noted, we're most concerned with is that we are spending efficiently to get the prospects we are getting as we know prospects are up. In terms of prospects we are getting in the behavior in terms of auto or auto home, we are increasingly being positioned as the bundle provider for certain. And we do measure consumers' perception on that. And certainly, our quotes for bundles both in the direct channel as well as the agency channel have been growing faster than in the mono line.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you very much\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nSuneet Kamath: Great. Thank you. I wanted to circle back to Road Test. It sounds like you have had the technology for a while, but maybe haven't focused on it or marketed it. So just curious why the decision to make a push now? And are you planning on rolling that out to existing policyholders, as well as new customers, or just new customers? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We had something called test drive years ago. I want to say five or six years ago maybe. And at the time there were some complications, because the way it was up, they need to put in some data. So we think that that was probably one of the reasons we did a little bit of advertising not a lot. So we've been working on-road tests, just to give people the ability to still have their own coverage and test what it would be with Progressive. And again, we've been working on this for a while. We want to make it very worthy of our customers. So I'd say we've been working on this for over a year, rolled it out a couple of months ago. Data is really early, because we want to continue to learn as we spread -- as we broaden that coverage. But, yes, so you wouldn't do it if you're for a customer for -- so you'd probably have snapshot already. These are for customers that have other coverage. Again, we're going to work through the funnel economics on that and then likely roll it out more broadly in the very near future.\nJohn Sauerland: That appears to have been our final questions. So that concludes our event. James I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. \nOperator: That concludes The Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. It was an extremely close and not yet decided election. I thought I'd open with a few words before we get to your questions. I know that the elections are on everyone's mind, including those at Progressive. I think it's important that our shareholders know that we live our core values, specifically the golden rule, regardless of the candidate we support. I'm very proud that in the end, we're all united in our commitment to caring for our customers, our communities, our shareholders, and most importantly for each other. As you know, we feel strongly that our people and our culture are a significant competitive advantage for us. They're one of our four strategic pillars, and we rely on our incredible culture to get us through challenging times, and come out more focused and united than ever. This year has been no different as we move forward together. I thought I'd share a note that I received on Monday from an IT Group manager Scott, regarding a video I did on Unity last week. This really exemplifies who we are as a company and why we win in the marketplace. He said Tricia, I have so much to be thankful for in this year and month and there is a literal pile of things for which I'm deeply appreciative for you and your team, truly, and I know I speak for so many others I am grateful. Then he went on to share the communication that he sent to his team and these are words that are echoed by so many leaders at progressive. His note said, it's the last Tuesday in October, which means that next week marks the national election and another end to political yard sign season. Here's the sign we placed in our own yard. And the sign started with love your neighborhood it talked about loving your neighbor regardless of race, who you love, et cetera. Conveying what we've hoped for our neighborhood, that regardless of next week's outcome, we hope that our common bond as neighbors can prevail over the differences, really an extension of the golden rule. That's not to say that it's not easy or that we're not strong in our political convictions, but it's also to say that we strive to respect, care for and even love our neighbors regardless of their vote or other differences. The same applies here at work with Progressive culture rooted in our core values. My DRG is committed -- direct reporting group is committed to support the diversity of our people. Please work to grow and sustain that spirit of collegiality and friendship with each other through and beyond the election. And these words really truly reflect who we are as a company and you know, being up late and in the middle of the night and this morning, I will end up after this call shooting another video today to ensure The Progressive people who may feel stressed, remain calm and focused, even though there'll be delayed results. Also, tomorrow marks our Eighth Annual Keys to Progress, where we give away cars to deserving veterans. Due to restrictions on business operations for the program participants and social distancing requirements, our giveaway events will be small, but still very meaningful. All-in-all, this is another great example of giving back to our communities where we've donated over 750 vehicles in the past eight years. Being a successful business starts with our people and this quarter continues to exemplify what you can do with the right team and the right culture. As I stated in my letter, we're extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We're also acutely aware that these times are tumultuous and that we have to remain nimble as events unfold. That's really always been our strong suits. Thank you. And with that James will take the first question Thanks Mike. Yes, let me give you some insight and it's a little bit difficult to compare with PCI because they haven't reported Q2 yet. They're not as volatile as Q2, but let me go through a couple. So, when you think of PD -- it's sort of the opposite of what happened in Q2 in terms of inbound subrogation. Our supplement payments, which is inbounds sub are coming from a period of lower volume applied to a period of an increase in current volume. So, we report 3.9%, PD incurred. It's a little bit higher, if you remove that inbound sub, about four points higher. So, right around 8.5 points. So, it's a little bit higher, but clearly less than Q2 when we were at 12.7. On collision, again the outbound sub mix is no longer driving trends. And that's of course, the money we receive in. And if you remove that sub percentage, this 6.2 goes up a little bit, that was negative in Q2. So that was very different. And it's all really about the numerator and denominator when you're having frequency changes quarter-to-quarter. You talked about BI, our incurred severity is similar to Q2. So, we have some aging, which we believe accounts for about two points. And then we have another one point to two points that relates to facts of loss -- loss shift. So, what we did was we took a look at quarter two of 2019 facts of loss, and then we compared that to quarter two of 2020 facts of loss. And what we're seeing, we think this is likely because of less morning congestion commute, that there are less rear end accidents. So, think I'm kind of a fender bender, that wouldn't cause much damage from a severity perspective or an injury perspective. There are more intersection accidents, which are always more severe. So our estimates take into account the aging inflation and the facts of loss, mix shift, we believe is around 7% to 8%. So while we are reporting the 11.6%, we believe it's a little bit lower based on those two issues. So PIP so difficult because there's so many different state mix changes. And in the severity \u2013 the higher severity space account for about two points of with those mix shifts. So we think that aside from New York most of the PIP states are around 6% to 7% severity. So it's not as volatile. It's still different just because of the situation with COVID and vehicle miles traveled and different loss patterns. But hopefully that will give you some insight into our severity trends. Yes. I mean on the auto side in the private passenger auto side when we market, we're marketing for the direct side but we believe that our agents are reciting to that. So when the stay-at-home orders happened, a lot of our agents weren't able to actually work or open their branches, some of them obviously were able to do it from their home but we saw applications go down. And now we're seeing them increase a little bit as things start to open. So that could be volatile for a while depending on what happens with rates of infection. What I will say is that the direct-to-consumer side really has increased on the commercial side. So our commercial business has always been the majority from the agents. It's a more complicated product and we are seeing more direct-to-consumer on the commercial side. That trend likely would have been happening over time as people felt comfortable with the products they're buying it really depends on complexity. But I will say that in our for-hire transportation, it's the strongest our direct channel where those new ventures are coming in directly to Progressive. So it's hard to say if it will continue. It could be what's happening with pandemic, it could be what's happening with younger truckers for example, starting new ventures and they're more comfortable going direct. But what I would say is we're glad that we've invested in the direct side of the business. We continue to feel like we want to have broad coverage for where when and how customers want to buy and just be available for everyone depending on that need. Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. We do think that's what happened. We think that is reflected pretty when something changes in a given state. We look at this from state-to-state. There's really a variety of vehicle miles traveled and ranges. It's still now much obviously higher than the trough of 40% right around 10%-ish 10% to 15% across the country. We're really digging in to kind of understand it. We do see the congestion is still a very different in the morning to me where there's less congestion. We're starting to dig into how we look at the types of job you have, and so we can try to understand people that might work-from-home for a longer period of time versus people that have jobs where you need to be on about. And in fact we're really looking through our UBI data that are Robinsons or people that are 65 and older their features fell in line with their vehicle miles traveled and we just think they're driving less during rush hour or they're working from how more they have roles that can work from home they might be retired. And the younger demographics what we would call the spends and dines and wrights their features fell more than the VMC, although the gap is narrowing. And they had a small drop in mileage. We believe that these are jobs that can't be done from home. So we're watching that closely. I think a lot depends on what happens in the next several weeks with infection rates and what specific states do. So again what we'll do is we continue through our product group watching those states and those areas very closely to understand those frequency trends and using data both on the Snapshot side and the smart hall side in commercial where we're not seeing that change. So the truck drivers are on the road more because of moving goods back and forth. So we see a little bit different on the commercial side. And even though the congestion has decreased, we know that they're on the road more. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. It's changing always and we're thankful that we have a lot of data in our usage-based insurance across many of our products and we'll keep watching that and react as necessary. Yes. So immediately, we've always had a pretty good high take rate on the direct side. So immediately, when we had the shutdown, we saw an uptick in that. And that sort of leveled off. On the agency side where we haven't had historically a great of a take rate, we saw that go up, and it's continues. So I think, agents and I've been -- I probably talked in one of the great things about COVID is that, I've been able to get out and talk to literally thousands of agents in the last couple of months, virtually, of course, and they understand that they need to be competitive, and they've been talking and selling Snapshot to their clients, to our mutual clients. And so that has increased and that has continued to kind of maybe level out, but it's increased much more than before COVID. On the commercial side, September was the biggest Smart Haul enrollment ever and the monthly take rate climbed to about 24%. So we're seeing that definitely on the commercial side. John, do you want to add anything? Yes. I mean, we feel really great. We've added 2.4 million policies compared to last September. So we feel like we were well positioned coming into the pandemic. And then we reacted very quickly. So we knew that vehicle miles travel has been down. We immediately gave to 20% credits for two months to our auto customers. We feel that that -- it could change, so that helped us with retention, because those customers were able to say, obviously, there were some moratoriums as well and they'll have to play out depending on what happens, if there's stimulus, et cetera. And then we started to do what we do best and surgically look at state by state, channel by channel, product by product, because we want to balance that growth and profitability. And we've really enjoyed gaining share across the board and we want to continue that. So what we're doing now is, what we call, taking small bites of the apple in terms of rate decreases. If we see conversions going down or we're less competitive and we get a lot of intel from other companies and our agents, we will take rates down slightly. So we talked about taking it down about 1 percentage for the quarter and 3% April through September. We did that in about 37 states and when I say 37 states, there might have been two rate decreases, maybe 0.5% maybe 1%. We really watch this and we're able to react so quickly, which keeps us really competitive when people are shopping. And then, April through December, we will have taken some form of rate decrease in about 42 states and that is about 84% of our country-wide net written premiums. So, again, surgically being able to react to rate, be competitive. And we do that going both ways, depending on the product. But we feel like we're positioned well, like John said, and everybody had whether they took credits or discount, everyone's trying to make sure that we are competitive. This is a very competitive industry and we feel like we're in a really good position, which is why I started the letter off the way I did. I'm very pleased with our results and our reaction to COVID and what we've been able to do for our customers when they need us the most. Yes. So we've had the same objective in the company since we went public in 1971, that to grow as fast as we can and make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so, we always try to balance that. That said, we have five core values and one of them is profit. So if we don't believe we can be profitable then we'll start growing, profit comes first. So, here's the deal. We don't want to give away margin. So if we believe that we can grow and still grow at that 96 or less than a combined ratio, we'll do so. If we don't, we'll keep the margin and understand that again, that is as such, we do it at such a surgical level, that the 96, grow as fast as you can, is our job objective for the overall company but we look at it very different across our portfolio. So, yes, we're going to continue to try to aggressively grow, gain market share all while making sure that we achieve our profitability goal. Thank you. Yes, so retention for us is really the Holy Grail, you want -- you spend the money to acquire customers, they come in, you want to make sure we give great service and they reward us with the retention. So, we look at retention for what we call policy life expectancy. On the trailing 12 months, it's up to 9%, up 10% of agency, 7% indirect. Now, the caveat is we're getting a benefit of the billing leniencies and moratoriums and so we would say -- we would say that those are the numbers, but they may be conservative, depending on what happens with people and jobs and unemployment, etcetera. Our trailing three is a little bit lower and a little bit more volatile. Trailing three is 7% up, up in 6% in agency 8% indirect.  And on the commercial line side, of course, we look at a 12 month basis because those are annual policies; PLE is up about 4%. So, we're very pleased with that, but we also know that there's a lot of volatility going on right now. And we'll do our best to keep our customers and to work with them, our CRM, our customer relationship management group on both the direct side auto and commercial lines auto, work very close to the customers if they need to make changes to their policy in order to keep their coverage available. So, I would say the PLE numbers that we state that we stayed in the queue are very positive. But we also know a part of that is because of the lenient scene moratorium on based on COVID. Yeah, we talk about expense ratios all the time. And we're pretty proud of our results. It's a balance, of course, making sure that we're investing in things like digital that our customers need. I think the one of the silver linings of the pandemic is that we learned that we can write really good estimates from photos and videos and we were working on that prior to the pandemic. But obviously, it was exacerbated based on the fact that we all you know kind of went into our homes to do the work. So, we continue to experiment and see what type of vehicles that we can look at and not be side of car and understand, is that is a quality estimate. Because you don't want to have such a as an example such a low loss expense ratio or loss expense adjustment ratio, if your accuracy is not good, because that indemnity is the biggest part of what we pay out.  And we continue to work in our CRM organization, understand how customers can get things they need without human intervention. John Sauerland's Group is working on, some RPA process. And so there's, we have a lot of things going around the company, we're actually we had, we had completed a five year plan for a Board of Directors last year. And obviously we're redoing it this year, because a lot of the changes and that's actually been a topic of what we're what we try to achieve.  We have internal goals that we work on together. And we balance that with investments of like John said, advertising, digital, but we constantly try to look good. How can we absolutely do more with less than not affect our customers? And we know that this is a competitive industry, and that competitive prices are really important. So that expense ratio is a big part of it whether it's on the overall side or decline side. John you're the first string holder you want to add any color? Yes. I mean I think that we \u2013 from a talent perspective, we feel really positive where we're at. We do \u2013 we have been investing in understanding how to have functionality to gather data from third parties whether it be OEs and we call it Express data quote. So that will be something that we're working on now. I mean I think the question is \u2013 or the answer is that yes, the talent is important. We believe that at some point we'll have to answer who owns the data but we've been working on this with a lot of partners over time to understand how to get quotes our way and understand that data to better understand trends. Does that answer your question? Got it. Yes I wasn't sure if I answered that. Yes, it's great competition. We have had \u2013 they have shot in data for a long, long time. And so we feel very comfortable. The fact that I could be able to tell you today, I think when Elisa answered the question that our Robinson cohort, the feature is sell in line with vehicle miles traveled, et cetera, we're able to watch that real time. And especially, now I'm very excited about what we're doing now on the commercial side and I talked about that with the floor higher transportation to be able to give these discounts to those delivery trust, those trust drivers interest and understand the best drivers are really important. That will help with retention. That will help with loss cost. So the competition is great, because it allows us to never stop evolving. So years ago we only had the dongle and you had to plug it in and then you could do a wireless. Now we have the mobile device. John talked about our road test. We have Snapshot Proview. So it forces us in a really good way to continue to invest data and collecting data on our 24 plus million policyholders. So we feel like we're in a really great position and competition only makes us better. You know what? That's -- I'm glad you brought that up, because I -- we've been thinking about that a lot. And I know there's been -- there will be challenges because of the pandemic on regulatory issues. So Michael this would be a lot longer answer than you probably want. But I think it's really important for me to make a couple of points. Basically on risk based pricing and then on kind of what's happening in the world. So first and foremost, we've been getting questions on the usage of credit specifically, does it affect race. And race is never used in pricing insurance projects. In fact it's illegal. A few people have the exact same risk profile. If there's a person that's just like me, same driving, same credits, and we happen to be different races, we get the same rates. Basically we are risk base and race lined. And I also want to make sure that it's clear that progressive supports legislative and regulation that enables insurers to leverage all the available data technology and advanced analytics to price insurance risks when it reflects the insurance cost. And that's really key, we want to have a rate for the specific risk. And for me it's -- for us it's about accuracy, and it allows people and consumers and small business owners to fulfill their American dream and achieve their economic opportunities that they desire. We've talked a lot in the past about the virtuous cycle. If you've got rating accuracy at least a broader consumer availability and affordability, which leads to growth and financial success not just for our shareholders but for the company and for job creation. We've been able to create so many jobs in the last several years, that leads to innovation and segmentation and then goes back to rating accuracy. So we've had that the virtuous cycle that we've been very proud of. And in the past, we've talked about \u2013 it's the regulator's role to work with us closely in the industry to ensure solvency, ensure compliance and facilitate healthy and competitive markets that provide a wide variety of options for consumers. So key elements that I've mentioned before to focus on is ensuring that at prices for insurance are not inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. So we're strong advocates for healthy, competitive volunteer insurance and broad distribution. And for the U.S. insurance industry, we want to be able to continue to facilitate the risk taking in transfer that drive economic growth through delivering products that are both available and affordable. So for us we --in the industry we believe ,we want to preserve the sanctity of contract and the continued support for risk-based pricing. Now all that said, we do recognize that for some individuals mandatory insurance protection can be a significant financial burden. We're very open to collaborating with regulatories and other regulators and other industry leaders on solutions for those individuals versus creating massive and unnecessary market disruption that will likely have a negative outcome for certain segments. So that's sort of my feel on, why we've continued to support risk-based pricing which credit is one variable of many. I think how we think about affordability challenges and we just have to think about where we're at in the time of history and decisions that we make that affect the future for consumers. So if you go back to our route in 1937. I'm very proud of Progressive. We started out as the nonstandard insurer allowing people in Cleveland Ohio who couldn't get insurance be able to do that. And then of course you know they're rust eventually countrywide. And we're able to have access to affordable protection across many segments. We have a critical role, I believe in inviting innovation segmentation and the use of technology and data to provide greater access to competitively priced insurance for all. We shouldn't confuse affordability challenges that many face during this unprecedented pandemic with our long standing and solvent model of providing affordable and widely available protection. I think the issues that have arisen regarding social injustice couldn't stem from the insurance industry they've been looming for decades and the events this year brought them to the surface. And now I think we need to really get together and ultimately solve the root problem of opportunity and equality for all not just during the pandemic, but ongoing. So from my perspective and this list could go on and I'll shut up, but very short term after the elections decided we need some form of stimulus to get us through this next wave of infections. And my hope is that, we're able to distribute it more surgically this time to those that need it most. I believe that we need to raise the minimum wage over time to $15 per hour. I will note that all active Progressive employees already make over $15 an hour and we're proud of that. And as a country our focus should really be on additional funding. So the schools can safely reopen and deliver effective online communication. You can't get ahead. If you don't have the ability to learn online which requires infrastructure investments like access to broadband coverage. So I could go on and on, but the message here is that, we as a country are facing a really great opportunity to make substantive changes. And as an insurance company we'll continue to play a role in focusing on rational and risk-based solutions so that everyone is able to achieve the economic opportunities they desire. I've been obviously thinking about that a lot Michael. So I'm glad you brought it up. I think that credit is a powerful variable. It is it is not race related. We do not believe it's race related and we'll continue to hold firm on them. Well I think ultimate success Gary is to be able to acquire customer at/or below our targeted acquisition cost. But more importantly, as we look at and expand our product line, we're able to do so with our creatives. So for years we had flow inside the superstore, the whole message is savings, savings, savings. And now we have obviously and entire network of characters that talked about savings, but also talk about protection for your home. And we're seeing that work. An example is, I don't know if you've seen it or not, we have had this campaign for a few years and we've settled it on a character called Dr. Rick which is Parentamorphosis as you become your parents when you buy your first call. I think that a lot of people can relate to that. We're seeing the results of that do really well. We've done a couple of good campaigns with the Cleveland Browns quarterback and market to guys that due the 10-yard line chains that we are able to play during the live sports wishes, which is what everyone's watching now until we go back to regular television. So we look at what we call new prospects that haven't shopped us in the last six months. And then we look -- from that we look at do they convert and at what cost. And all those things lead us to understand when the creative works, when it doesn't, when it does we double down and get deeper in the campaign. When it doesn't, we move on and get more creative. So during COVID, I'm really proud of our marketing department, because everything is shut down. And initially we did some nice campaign stories that were softer, because everyone was sort of just nervous about what was happening, because it was so new. And now we're really doing a lot that we're kind of moving forward. But even in the meantime we did really creative opportunities where we had flow and her whole squad, that we call it, on a Zoom call, et cetera. We really got creative to make sure that we didn't miss a step. We know this is a competitive environment and we wanted to continue to be on consumer shortlist, out and available, thinking of Progressive when they go to shop. Yes. We occasionally do agent incentives. It may be, based on things like UBI and if we see something that we want them to do more. We, over the years, have changed some of the agency commission structures depending on if you're selling preferred, Robinsons, auto, home bundled those agents to platinum agents get more commission. They're allowed to have 12-month policies on the auto side, so we're giving them that. And we've done a lot in our platinum agency to have incentives based loss ratio and other things. So we didn't always do those in the past. Our relationship with our agents has really changed in a very positive way. Like I said at the beginning, I've been able to talk to a lot of agency agents. Just not long ago I had our top 25 platinum agents. Usually we do something with them. We obviously couldn't this year. So while we'll keep our overall commission level about the same rate, we have bifurcated and we'll give you a different commission based on the incoming type of customer, which we believe is the long-term value of that customer. So, obviously, cost matters a lot, brand matters a lot, commission matters a lot. And probably the last thing I would say and coming from the claims organization, agents are always so happy to not have to deal with any complaints, because our claims organization is so stellar. So there's a lot that goes into it. Clearly, cost is one of them. They benefit from our brand. But, yes, we have -- we do incentives and we have different commissions based on the type of customer that we get in namely preferred. Yes, I think this month or last month we finished full rollout of portfolio quoting. So, the agent feedback is extraordinary. Just you got to make it easy. Thanks Gary. Yes. When I usually speak about marketing I go to sort of the mass media and that's one portion of how we market media. We're on streaming. So, we advertise on Hulu. We advertise on most of the social network, channels, and affiliates on Internet. So we -- and we have generic search. So there -- we have a variety of ways to make sure we get our message to you and do everything we can to get our message to you the right number of times not too much not too little because we don't want to bog you down. So, yes, there's -- besides the creative also many different ways. And there's sometimes on a digital platform that will have characters that we don't even have on mass media. And it's usually the specific demographic that we're looking for in that channel. So, yes, we a variety of ways. And as things change with how people watch TV or watch streaming, we'll continue to play a part of that. And the great part is we have access to so much data to understand pretty quickly if it's working so we can remove it or double down. I think John wanted to say something to be yes. We're increasing the spend in those channels for sure because many people have cut the cord and don't watch any TV so we need to have access to them through those different channels. John do you want to add to on? And I talked a little bit about that, when I talked about the virtuous cycle in terms of when you have a segment, you innovate, et cetera and you do that. I think that insurtech are serving a great purpose in terms of ease of use and it would be I think, easy to be able to or nice to be able to I should say start without having legacy systems. That's said we have them, we work around them but we don't say okay, we're just going to be here in time and try to work around. We're constantly innovating from a technology perspective, ease of use perspective. And we believe that part of our DNA is really innovation. We've been first in a lot. I won't go into naming that and we don't intend to change that. And the great benefit that we have that the insurtechs don't is the cost of acquisition. And for us we're going to continue to hone on in \u2013 hone in on that. And that's why we were able to increase our policies $2.5 million in one year. That's the reason we're able to do so and make our target profit margins, which are also very important. We have shareholders that are \u2013 that own us because they know we're committed to our 96th growth fast you can. We don't have the \u2013 the availability to say we're going to test things, regardless if we make money or not. So we're very innovative. We're always going to do everything we can to make a profit one of our core values and we're able to leverage our size to have lower acquisition costs. Thank you. Thanks, David. Yes we've worked with many different OEs over the years and I talked a little bit about that Express a quote that will give us the functionality to work with OEs and other aggregators. We do \u2013 we have many relationships and we have some in the works that I'm not liberty to talk about right now. John? Yeah. So we meet with the investment committee John and I and Jon Bauer, our Head of Progressive Capital Management throughout the year understanding our capital strength, which is very strong and always thinking about some dry powder for anything that might come up. We've had a couple of sessions that we have a range that we're thinking about. Obviously the Board will be the one that decides that. We meet with them at the beginning of December and we'll talk through something and get more in line with what we believe the dividend will be payable next year. So obviously that's an unknown because it will be a Board's decision. We feel really great about our capital position. We feel great about our growth and our profit. And we -- in the past, we've been able to share that with our shareholders. Again, we don't have any specific amount I can share with you, but we feel really great about our year. Anything can happen. There's still a few months left but we feel good. I would say the majority of that is our reduction in premiums. I haven't seen too much of a change in our business mix profile. \nQ \u2013 Brian Meredith: Great. Thank you. Yes. That's so hard, Josh, to look at and compare it three years ago. I do think that, even when prices are going down in this environment, it might be different. And this is -- I hate to use the word, it's still unprecedented. It really depends on the situation with the consumer and what they're looking for in terms of, did somebody get furloughed or waived off, et cetera. So I think it's hard to know. And what we really focus on is making sure that have the message out there that we have that broad coverage that we have. The ability to measure our acquisition costs and now that they're under our targeted amount to get the customer in there. So it's really hard for me to say. I think what we've tried to do is just, when they are shopping regardless of the reason, we're available, we're easy and we're competitively priced. Do you want to add anything? Yes. We had something called test drive years ago. I want to say five or six years ago maybe. And at the time there were some complications, because the way it was up, they need to put in some data. So we think that that was probably one of the reasons we did a little bit of advertising not a lot. So we've been working on-road tests, just to give people the ability to still have their own coverage and test what it would be with Progressive. And again, we've been working on this for a while. We want to make it very worthy of our customers. So I'd say we've been working on this for over a year, rolled it out a couple of months ago. Data is really early, because we want to continue to learn as we spread -- as we broaden that coverage. But, yes, so you wouldn't do it if you're for a customer for -- so you'd probably have snapshot already. These are for customers that have other coverage. Again, we're going to work through the funnel economics on that and then likely roll it out more broadly in the very near future."

            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "I just might add Mike, you use the new normal in both the severity and the direct questions. And we aren't thinking there's any new normal to point out right now. It's a very dynamic environment obviously, but we think we're playing a well. So in the direct space, as you noted in the Q advertising is up a 29% for the quarter. So when you see us spending more in advertising you should know that we are seeing opportunities to spend efficiently to bring in business. That is what we call the prospects side of the equation and prospects are up as we noted in the Q about 8% for the quarter, but conversion is up as well. And that was a quarter where some of our competitors had lower pricing in effect because of their approach to COVID rebates or credits and some of those have come off now. So from a competitiveness standpoint all else equal, we think we're in a pretty good place. Conversion is up 5% for the quarter. We may even be getting more competitive. So again all else equal, our advertising especially being even more effective. Yeah. So that's definitely seeing that take rates go higher, especially in the for-hire transportation segment that Tricia was noting earlier. So that is, you can think of sort of delivery trucks, as well as interstate trucking. And we're very excited to see especially the take rate on what we call new ventures. So a lot of truckers are going out on their own these days. And truck insurance premiums are pretty high. So they're very open to offers that might lower that premium. And it's great that the take rate there is even higher than the overall. And we feel that segment is very well priced, especially when we have the Smart Haul insights that we have really from day one. So the other thing, I would mention on Snapshot more generally is that we are -- well, we haven't marketed a lot, we have something called Snapshot Road Test in market now. And the take rate there is encouraging. And this is via mobile devices whereby you can do what we used to call test drives. So if you drive for a while, we get your driving behavior, we deploy that at your initial quote. Today in Snapshot, we give you a discount for participating and then give you the fully developed discount at renewal with Road Test. You get that up front. So we're excited by the early take rates there again, we have a marketed it, but we think we're ready to do consumers will be very interested. Yeah. So it's available today. We just haven't marketed it. Yes. Certain many competitors are aspiring to our level of cost structure but there are some competitors who have better cost structures than progressive. So we've been focused on continuing to get more competitive in terms of cost structure for years. As Tricia noted, we think of it in two buckets. So we think of what we call non-acquisition expense ratio and acquisition expense ratio. In the acquisition, we put advertising, as well as agents commission, so I just mentioned earlier, advertising for the quarter was up 25%. It was up 20% year-to-date. We think that's good growth in expenses because we're acquiring customers we're going to have for a long time. Similarly on the agent side, we have to pay competitive commission in order to continue to grow there. So we think growth in expenses in that portion of the expense ratio is good. We focus on the non-acquisition expense ratio, where we are trying to drive what we think of as our infrastructure costs lower. And if you go back around five years, as Tricia noted, I think we've taken out maybe close to three or four points on our non-acquisition expense ratio and we \u2013 our site set on reducing that further is as Tricia noted, price competitiveness is not the only thing that matters in the marketplace but it is a very big part of the consideration set for auto and home insurance as well as commercialize especially. I just elaborate on Tricia's last point Gary to say ease of use. So, price competitiveness is extremely important. Ease of use is almost as important in my perspective. So, as Tricia noted not having to deal with hassles on the back end with a claim for sure, but front end as well. So, we've invested heavily in technology to make quoting and now quoting the household in our agents easier. And that will definitely help drive business to Progressive as well. Yes, the growth in spend in nontraditional media has outpaced traditional for years now and we're constantly testing into new media where we can. We have a group that entirely focuses on new ways to reach people. And the overarching philosophy is where when and how consumers want to buy. So, we are definitely investing. And normally I think relatively speaking on the forefront of trying new channels and ensuring that we can actually measure the success of those new channels. So, we are very disciplined that we're out spending new money that we find ways to measure its effectiveness and I think that differentiates us relative to a lot of other marketers. Yes. So we've worked directly with OEs over the years. We started a relationship with GM. I can't remember how many years ago now, probably four years ago. As you know to get the data directly from vehicles and offer rates that are reflective of driving behavior at the point of quote and the point of sale. We have also worked with aggregators of that data or third-party gatherers of that data. So there are apps on your phone that are tracking where you're going and how you're driving and we've worked with those entities as well. It is a funnel as we think of it. When we talk about funnel economics, the number of people that come in the top there versus the number that come out of the bottom meaning actually buy a policy has been challenging. That is not to say we won't continue and are continuing to test in that space. And in new media, we normally see funnel challenges at the outset and we work through the experience to continue to refine it, and continue to make it better and to get to the point where the funnel economics work for us. So we've been testing into the data direct from OEs in numerous manners for a number of years now and have shown some success but not to the point that it will be a considerable portion of our media spend anytime soon frankly. That's a fair way to think about it. And think of conversion not only as you got to quote and you then bought the policy, but getting folks from interested in the whole process even to get to the core process. So it's a longer funnel than just got the quote, bought the policy. Then when we talk about in conversion percentage that's what we're talking about there. This is we think of the entire funnel efficiency. We have approximately five minutes left in the call and still have a handful of people in the queue. We will go through the last handful here and go a little bit long. However, we will limit everybody to a single question. if you have additional question, you may contact the Investor Relations group at the contact information on the website. With that, I'll hand it back over to James. Yes. So I agree with Tricia. There are many different metrics around shopping behavior and they don't always agree. As Tricia noted, we're most concerned with is that we are spending efficiently to get the prospects we are getting as we know prospects are up. In terms of prospects we are getting in the behavior in terms of auto or auto home, we are increasingly being positioned as the bundle provider for certain. And we do measure consumers' perception on that. And certainly, our quotes for bundles both in the direct channel as well as the agency channel have been growing faster than in the mono line. That appears to have been our final questions. So that concludes our event. James I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to The Progressive Corporation second quarter investor event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website, and we will use this event to respond to questions.  Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Although our quarterly investor relations events typically includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use all of the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for a question-and-answer session with members of leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and our first and second-quarter's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of challenges we face. In particular, note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first-quarter includes discussions of the risks and uncertainties that we face, including specific risk factors arising directly and indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic and these risks are further referenced in our second-quarter 10-Q. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments.  Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Doug. I really wanted to actually introduce you to everyone. I know this is your first IR call and it's in a weird circumstance due to COVID. But I thought -- I know you've talked to a couple of people over the last month or so, and I've really enjoyed working with you. A little history of this role being really additive for the person in it, as well as Progressive, as you all know, Julia Hornack took her talents to St. Pete for Progressive Home. Patrick Brennan was a prior director of investor relations, who's now our treasurer and Matt Downing is our HR controller. So we pride ourselves on movement around the company. We think this is such a good role for Doug at this time in his career, it really helps both analysts, investors, Progressive and the individual. So Doug, could you tell us a little bit about your career?\nDoug Constantine: Sure. Well, I've had the opportunity to work throughout the organization in my eight years at Progressive. Spent five years in Commercial Lines, where I managed five different states and included [indiscernible] team for two of our trucking BMTs. Also had an opportunity to work in national accounts, where I worked with some of our largest agency relationships. And most recently, I've been a Progressive Personal Lines PM, where I managed two different states. Really looking forward to working with many of you on this call, and I'll do my best to feel the huge shoes that Julia has left behind.\nTricia Griffith: Great. Thanks, Doug. We are thrilled to be working with you. And of course, we do miss Julia. But we're glad to have you here. Jason, we're ready to take the first question.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you, good morning. My first question, I was hoping to get a little bit of color on how you're seeing frequency and also severity trending in July. Obviously, the trends in the second quarter were pretty favorable. And just as individual start going back to work and perhaps we see a rise in miles driven just due to folks driving for summer vacations, etc. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of how the trends are, and if they started to stabilize in a direction toward pre-COVID level?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. I won't talk about July, but I will talk about when we think about frequency, I'll state that June was lower than the full quarter at about 24%. So we are seeing them stabilize. We still -- it's very different depending on the state as well. So you can see vehicle miles travel go up. And then immediately, if things close down, they go back and forth. So we formed sort of a macroeconomic dashboard. We have a lot of data to look at that, and we react to that. And of course, I'll go into severity because the calendar period severity is very distorted by the drop in new features. So the mix difference compared to last year is very distorted as you see, unlikely with a lot of our competitors. They talked about this last quarter with PD. And remember, we report incurred versus paid. And some of our competitors report paid, as well as PCI. Same story on PD incurred, it's -- the supplements drove PD up about nine points. So when you look at those payments from prior quarters that were we're paying supplements on that frequency, the supplements in the numerator. And so those dollars are increased, where the incurred accounts are the denominator, and so that's where you'll see the difference. Same thing with BI, it's age inflate -- incurred severity about nine points this quarter. Average age of BIs are up about 7%, a little bit higher. So we look at the accident year trends being about 6 to 7%. PIP incurred is really reopens on supplements from PIP. And It accounts for about 25 points of frequency from -- again, from prior periods when frequency was normal. Now the oddest one in this quarter is really our collision incurred [indiscernible], and that is a -- the severity is negative on that. Mainly because when you look at Quarter 2 '20 -- or Quarter 2 '19, the frequency is down about 36%. And then as we thought about our plan because we had excess capacity in claims, we redeployed many different claims individuals. I think I talked last quarter about giving Ohio 100 members of our claims organization to adjudicate unemployment claims. We've also deployed claims people in our CRM organization as people are trying to kind of get their arms around their bills. We also redeployed about 100 people to our subrogation unit, which means that money is coming in. We have kind of full-court press on collecting money when we have liability disputes with our competition. And so that money has come in this quarter because we have 100 extra people actually doing that. And so that's really the -- how the severity trend has gone negative this quarter. So frequency, in June, we saw it abate a little bit to 24%. We'll watch it closely as things go, and we'll just react accordingly.\nElyse Greenspan: That's helpful. And then my second question, it seems like players in the space have kind of responded differently in terms of rate changes, right? I mean we've seen rates slowing, but obviously, there's a degree of magnitude between the different players. Are you seeing the difference in rate taking and obviously, part of that -- part of that is impacted, right, by the rebates, which all depends on the different company. But are you seeing the rating environment starting to have an impact on your new business trends? It seems like new business trends started to rise in the second quarter kind of from some of the COVID lows, kind of that we saw at the start of the quarter. So I'm just wondering if the rating environment was having an impact or it is more just folks there just see more shopping going on independent of that?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean we're seeing more shopping, I think, specifically in the direct part of our business. And how we look at rates, when we took the -- when we had the credit, the $1 billion credit in April and May, that was sort of a, hey, we're -- this thing happened very quickly. COVID happened very quickly. We wanted to react. And now we're in the mode, really, we're back to grow as fast as we can at our target profit margins. But we're really trying to leverage, we believe we have, and that's industry-leading segmentation. So we are looking across the country, each product manager, state by state, channel by channel, product-by-product and being much more surgical when we're thinking about our rates. So as an example, in quarter two, we lowered rates and states that made up about half of our auto premium. And if you want to go from the beginning of COVID, take April through August rates that are in play, we'll -- we'll have reduced rates in 35 states that make up more than three quarters of our auto premium. That 35 states, that doesn't mean it's 35 revisions. It could be a few more because maybe we take smaller bites of the apple. I always think about -- think about segmentation and especially increasing rates, unless it's something where we need to react very quickly. I think about my predecessor, Glenn Renwick, who always said, three ones is better than one three. And so we are very, very surgically looking at each state and trying to determine the best rate to continue our growth and make sure that we also have our target profit margin. Does that help, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, that is helpful. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning, thanks. First maybe, Tricia, you did mention Michigan auto reform in your letter. Maybe you can kind of give us an early preview of kind of how you see it playing out? Like directionally, do you expect pricing to fall a lot? Are direct writers like Progressive maybe in a better position versus the agency writers as you guys can kind of blanket targeted customers certain discounts, just curious how we should think about that [Inaudible] does move the needle, and it's very profitable for Progressive.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, Thanks, Mike. What I can say is we know it was -- it's a herculean effort to get ready for that event, and we were ready. I will tell you -- and this is, of course -- this is really early because it went into effect July 2nd. I can tell you that we are very pleased with results in terms of growth. Again, we're going to have to watch this closely because individuals are going to choose to have PIP as it was before and not. So it's a little bit early to tell anything. We'll have a lot more data next quarter. What I can say from just looking at the early results, from a growth perspective, we are pleased.\nMike Zaremski: OK. So I'll put that maybe next quarter. Moving maybe to Telematics. We're hearing industry some participants talk about an increase of a take-up rate. And those industry participants are typically on the agency side. Have you seen any increase in uptake in either direct or agent for your Telematics program?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Mike, we have. We've seen it actually more on the agency side. So our direct side went up a couple of points, but leveled out. And of course, we already have a high percentage of take rate on our direct side -- and direct side. And our agency side, yes, it did tick up. And I think that makes a lot of sense because this is a great time to understand your rating equals one, and it's up about 12% on the agency side. So overall, about 40% on the direct side, about 12% on the agency side and so a little bit more than 20% overall.\nJohn Sauerland: And Mike, I would add that we have UBI in our commercial business as well. And take rate there is very strong. And we're seeing great trends around our for-hire segments in terms of their take rate and their own renewal rate as well. So we are broadening our UBI deployment and really pleased with what we're seeing in commercial lines.\nMike Zaremski: And then, could you give us the kind of the recent take-up rate like Tricia gave us on personal or commercial?\nJohn Sauerland: We have not provided our take rate on Smart Haul and our commercial business. But I would just tell you, it's exceeded our expectations out of the gate. And the other thing I would mention is that these truckers are required to have the recording devices in their vehicles by federal law. So we don't have the barrier of getting a device into the car or getting an app downloaded. We get the information directly from third-party providers of those devices in the trucks. So it is a pretty good proposition to a trucker who can get a significant discount on a premium, which is a pretty significant premium. So again, I would point to those items without pointing to a number and say, we're pretty pleased with [indiscernible].\nTricia Griffith: And I would say, I think, John, we a few quarters ago talked about -- or maybe as Karen talked about insurance being like the top -- one of the top three costs for those truckers. I think that that is really important. And we've seen trucking increasing based on COVID. I will also add, John talked about Smart Haul. We also have Snapshot Preview, which is available for our business auto and contractors. And although we don't have the data, it gives same upfront savings and fleet management. But we're encouraging -- we're encouraged, I should say, with the demand, and we think that will only increase. And we have that in about 40 states in our agency channel so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on just the bundled business, the Robinsons. In the 10-Q, it sounds like you had some pretty good growth in the Robinsons, particularly in the direct channel, but it also looks like you had some good growth in PIP in the agency channel. Just wondering where we're at in terms of the mix, what percentage of your book is now bundled policies? And where do you expect that to get to?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we're happy with our Robinsons growth. The agency channel is up a little bit over 18%, and the direct channel is up about 46%. I think our mix there is right around 10%, maybe a little bit lower. Our goal is to continue to have more bundled customers and so the goal is to have as many as we can. We want every auto customer in our book to be able to bundle when they have either a rental or a home, should that be other demographic. So we continue to push hard. You can obviously see it in our advertisement that we talk about protection in home. So our goal is continue to increase our numbers of Robinsons because we know they're stickier and give them reasons to stay based on the products and sources that we're able to provide.\nJohn Sauerland: And a little bit on that percentage. So a little higher in direct. We've been at it a little longer in the direct channel, but we've been really pleased with the Robinsons growth we've been able to achieve with Progressive Home, but that's behind where the direct channel is today. But if you blend them together, you come to a number, a little below 10%.\nDavid Motemaden: OK. Great. And then just my other question is just a higher-level question on -- just in terms of how you guys are thinking about miles driven and accident frequency. I know there is a lot of uncertainty, but just wondering what you guys are thinking about, will -- do you think that will ever get back to a level of miles driven and accident frequency that we were at pre-COVID and I guess, just how are you thinking you'll adjust given whatever environment you think we'll be in?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I'll start, David, by the caveat being, we really don't know because of all the different things that go into it. So schools reopening, cases going up, cases going down, vaccines, unemployment, work from home, all those things. So I'll start with that caveat. I will say with our Smart Haul data, we did see signs of congestion kind of flattening more recently. And we're starting to sort of look at data with that. And so we have some initial trends. And again, we're going to have to fine-tune these. So these are -- aren't perfect, but we're continuing to understand the measures of congestion, both on our Telematics on the commercial side, as well as our UBI on the auto side. So I'll give you a quick example. And again, these are going to change, but this is kind of how we look at it. So we've got -- vehicle miles traveled are up, not as up as much as they were this time last year. And obviously, losses haven't followed in particular. So we're trying to figure out the delta between those two. And what we have seen from a congestion perspective is that that does tell some of the delta. So on the UBI side, on the auto side, we believe that that congestion, the gap is about one point during morning rush hour and about nearly two and a half points on afternoon rush hour, which would take into account some of the differences in actually miles driven and accidents because less accidents happen when there's less congestion. Again, we're just digging into this as we have more and more. And the data changes and is very influenced about what states do depending on their rise or fall in cases.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks, good morning. Tricia, you talked in the past about how Progressive responds really quickly to frequency. And I was wondering whether there are any constraints. I mean, obviously, we're seeing frequency swing around a lot more than ever before. And from an internal perspective, are there stability considerations that would minimize the amount of rate change that you would pursue based on frequency?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. It was a little bit hard to hear, but I think what you were asking was how we would react to frequency from a rate change perspective. I think we take all the data into account. Frequency right now is just so hard -- it's always hard to predict, but it's even more difficult now with all the different inputs with COVID. Again, I'll go back to our stated goal, and we're going to try to grow as fast as we can. We'll look at all the trends and try to understand surgically, by channel, by product, how to continue to put our pedal on that growth mode while making sure we have our profit target margins. We never want to grow and just -- and not also have that profit come with it. So that's an important part. We want to make sure that we have competitive prices and growth. So the predicting frequency is going to be a real challenge for us in the near term just because of all the different inputs that are in a constant state of flux.\nMeyer Shields: Yes, that's helpful. I was just wondering whether there is a limit to how much embedded frequency change you'll include in a rate filing just because of how rapidly it could fluctuate?\nJohn Sauerland: I can elaborate a little bit there. So a rate filing, depending upon the size of your state is going to look at data, sometimes going back a year, sometimes going back three years. But you're trying to project the trend going forward because you're trying to price to a point in the future. So you can look backwards, which we do. But ultimately, what we're trying to do is price forward. So it's a little tricky at this juncture given the anomalies we're seeing due to COVID. So it's a great question as to how much of that we actually include on a going-forward assumption basis versus exclude because we think it's a one-off that will not be in plate down the road. So it really depends upon the robustness of the program we're pricing to and I look forward as to what we think we're going to be experiencing when those premiums are in effect, which can be for the next year to two.\nMeyer Shields: Follow-up question on the homeowner side. I know in the past you talked about correcting maybe the pricing for non-cat weather. And obviously, weather has been pretty bad this year, so if you could tell us internally how that progress has -- or how that's been progressing?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean you saw the results. So we're -- we need to make sure that profit is a big part of what we're thinking about in terms of property. And so as you know, we have our new product 4.0 model that we're rolling out. The hail and wind that's happened from a cat perspective has been pretty -- very high. What we're concentrating on right now is to continue to have segmentation. So we continue to roll our 4.0 product out. In addition, we're making changes to the products. And that includes minimum deductibles and ACVs on roofs because that's what we see, especially in hail-ridden states. Underlying ex-CAT, we feel better about our movement in property. We feel pretty good about it, as well as the growth. But again, we want to make sure that we continue to roll out our segmentation. We want to continue to roll out minimum deductibles. And more importantly, make it easy for people to shop. So we have property in 45 states. Now in 17 of those states, you can buy through a tablet or a phone. So we're pretty excited about our investments in technology around that. John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Sauerland: Sure. Yes. Unlike the vehicle programs, especially personal auto, where we've been getting rates more competitive. We're taking rates up in home. So the segmentation is really important. And I think we've got about 18 states out with our next-generation 4.0 product, which is fantastic. We're also increasing rates. We're taking them up almost 6% year-to-date. And we're obviously not hitting our profitability targets. But you also recognize that if you're looking at cat losses year-to-date, we changed from the aggregate stop-loss agreement that we employed last year, which was essentially a cat loss plus LAE ratio to a retention of 375 million of hail losses, effectively hail, wind, a nonnamed storm, and we're yet to hit that retention level. So if you adjust that, and if you assume that we are under the same agreement we had last year to a combined ratio that would be below 100, but still well above our target margins there, so we are taking actions, as Tricia noted, and we're also changing rates.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you so much.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. In those 18 states on 4.0, I think 16 of them have the mandates that I referred to in terms of min deductibles in ACV. So we feel good about where we're going. We need to continue to concentrate on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters : Good morning. My first question is around technology. I know you guys have been innovative with technology, but there's also been some new platforms that have hit the market like Root with usage-based insurance and lemonade and renters. Can you talk about your competitive position relative to some of these start-up companies that are gaining a lot of attention in the marketplace?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I feel like we're in a really nice competitive position for a couple of reasons. And we've had usage-based insurance for literally decades. And they've come in different forms, and we've continued to evolve as technology has evolved. So we have a lot of data to really understand that variable. And we continue to evolve. That's the best part. And it's not something that we sit still on. So we continue to evolve. I will say that start-ups are good competition because they're doing things that the consumers want. And we've always believed in the ability to rate a driver on their individual driving behavior. And so I think competition in that aspect is good. I think also where we have the benefit is in acquisition costs. If you are start-up, those acquisition costs are very expensive. We have a good base of auto customers, for renters in home, etc., and we're a known brand. So I feel like we're in a great position and we continue to add technology advances in our UBI, and I don't think you'll see that abated.\nJohn Sauerland: I'd just add a little bit to that. The usage-based model today that we predominantly employ applies discounts in the personal space basically at the first renewal point. We gave a participation discount upfront. Increasingly, we are getting that data upfront. And in Commercial Lines, we're always getting that data upfront and that's really the Root model. You might recall that, I don't know, five years ago or so, we rolled out what we called Snapshot Test Drive, which was a model where you get the driving behavior before you price the policy. We are doing that now with third parties that are -- such as OEMs, such as other app providers. And we are now deploying what we call Snapshot Road Test, which is a model where you download the app, we see your driving behavior, and we employ those discounts at new business, similar to our Commercial Lines model. So I think you'll gradually see migration to employing the driving data where available upfront and we think we're very well positioned for that transition. On the property side, I will point out that we have for a number of years now been the No.1 provider of homeowners quotes and the No.1 provider of renters quotes online. And as Tricia mentioned, brand is a big driver in all of the insurance space, and we think it is a key lever to have acquisition costs in a place that are feasible to make money over the long term.\nGreg Peters : And my follow-up question around your comments on acquisition costs. I realize you have the Snapshot product, the dongle, but then there's also a lower cost alternative of having the app on the phone. Can you talk to us about how the mix has shifted within your auto business from heavily Snapshot to more blended, where we are in that cycle and where we're going to get to?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think as we introduce the mobile device, that has continued to increase. I think it's easy. I think people get it. They can see their information more readily. We still have a fair amount that we're on the Snapshot dongle. I think as we continue to look at the model of senior information upfront, and we're very early on in that, and we haven't really even advertised that, we've seen a really high take rates. I think people -- I think a couple of things. One, we're trusted brand that understands UBI 2, the situation with COVID. I think people are going to -- want to give their data more and more, especially if they're not driving, and they're working from home more often.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you, good morning. Maybe a couple more questions on Telematics. First, when you look at the dongle versus the mobile app, do you find that they are equally precise and accurate?\nTricia Griffith: I'll take the last part.\nJohn Sauerland: I think you're asking about the accuracy of the data from a dongle versus the mobile app, you're breaking up a little bit. There are differences, for sure. Technology, as you can imagine, continues to evolve in the mobile space and pretty quickly. So there are definitely differences, but we are very confident that we can adequately price folks based on the mobile data. And the data that is coming directly from vehicles is growing as well. And that's obviously as robust as you can get. So we're very comfortable between mobile and dongle in terms of ability to price accurately. And like it was just discussed, it is a lower cost option, and can afford also continuous monitoring, if we so chose to do that as well. So a little different, but not materially. So it's way I would characterize it.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I would agree with John. I would say when we look at the data we have for dongle also versus the mobile device is a little bit different as well because we're able to understand handheld versus hand free and not just -- in addition to the time of day, miles traveled and hard breaking. So we're also getting a little bit more data, but there's a little bit of a difference, but nothing that we're concerned about.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then for the customers who do use UBI to [indiscernible].\nJohn Sauerland: We're having a lot of trouble hearing you or understanding. Can you say that one again?\nYaron Kinar: I'll try. I'm asking for the customers who sign up for UBI, what weighting do you assign the UBI data in the grand scheme of pricing those customers?\nJohn Sauerland: Sure. Sure. Some commentary there. It's very powerful rating variable. However, today, because not everyone takes the Snapshot option, we solve that last in terms of our algorithms. So we solve for all the other rating variables because all the customers will be rated on those rating variables and then we solve secondarily for Snapshot. So even though we would see it being our most powerful rating variable, one could surmise that if we solve for it first, it would be an even more powerful rating variable. But again, because we don't require everybody to take that option, we solve it last. Does that answer your question?\nYaron Kinar: It does. But can you also maybe offer like -- does it account for like 5%, 50%? How important is it?\nJohn Sauerland: That will vary at the customer level. So based on where you live and the other demographics of the household, as you can imagine, for more preferred households, it's going to be different than for more nonstandard households, young, old, etc., and urban and rural as well. So we don't provide an absolute percentage for you.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. I was hoping, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape right now in personal auto? And particularly, as I look at your largest competitor on the direct side, they're offering discounts to kind of new and renewal customers instead of these credits. Do you anticipate that having any impact on your ability to kind of grow new business in the near term?\nTricia Griffith: I mean I think everybody took a decision when we went through COVID on what to do and no one company had it perfect because the data was ever changing, it was very new. So I feel like GEICO is a great competitor. They took a different stance than we did in terms of taking the two credits in April and May. I feel very comfortable in our ability to continue to grow. And especially as the end came to the second quarter. So we've increased our advertising in auto about 12% this quarter. So that kind of tells you that we're very much in play for new business. We believe times like this, where there's disruption is really when we win in marketplace. And so we're -- although we hate the fact that this is happening to our country, we believe a lot more people will shop. And our goal is to have very competitive rates and great service once you're with us.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then my second question is with respect to the Commercial Lines business, you continue to have some adverse reserve development in that area. Is that related to some of the shared economy business? And kind of what is your experience on that business? Is there any changes going on?\nTricia Griffith: Well, the severity and the development is really -- it has been based on similar topics that we talked about before in terms of increased medical cost in the marketplace, higher attorney rep and newer features and then our mix of business going to for-hire trucking, which is a higher severity than business auto and contractors. And when you look at the quarter two reserve development in Commercial Lines, about 44 million really came from about four states, those states being big states. And so when you look at our overall -- year-to-date development overall, you can see Commercial Lines is the biggest part of that 116 million at 98 million. So we continue to watch that from the Commercial Lines perspective. Frequency is down as well. But we -- it's very much like I've talked about in prior quarters with specific states and those variables in terms of medical costs, attorney rep and our mix of business changing.\nBrian Meredith: So it's not specifically related -- it's not necessarily the rideshare-type businesses, it's just generally?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, T&C, we talk about our T&C, and we took our premium down by 29 million this month. So we're definitely seeing less driving, but in terms of the development piece, that really is about higher BI limits and our adjusters' reserve going up as well. It's a thing we talked about before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Tricia, I was hoping you could share with us an actual average rate number for the quarter and also through the year so far?\nTricia Griffith: I don't have it with me, but it's been -- it's pretty flat. I think our average written premium. The rate, you mean or rate of increase?\nRyan Tunis: Average premium.\nTricia Griffith: Between 1 and 2%.\nJohn Sauerland: Minus 1%. A little over minus 1% [indiscernible] for personal auto.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, personal auto.\nJohn Sauerland: We've taken commercial up a little over 2% and property I mentioned was almost 6%.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Sorry.\nRyan Tunis: Perfect. And then my follow-up is, I guess, looking through the 10-Q, in direct, you've got quotes up, but conversion rates down. I'm curious how you guys are interpreting because it sounds like you guys are being proactive in terms of making your rates more competitive. How are you interpreting your lower conversion rates?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think that when we look at -- we also want to add in new apps there. So our new apps in direct are also in conversion, we had some increased ad spend as well. I think conversion is down about 2% with quotes up 6%. It's -- the data is ever-changing because we do believe more people are shopping. But like I said, we spent more in the direct auto. And we feel comfortable with our new apps being up at 4% on the direct side and especially increasing toward the latter part of the quarter.\nJohn Sauerland: As Tricia noted, we are taking targeted rate decreases. So we have product managers generally who are managing a state or two, and they are very focused on where they sit competitively or watching conversion in their markets, and they're taking targeted cuts largely at this juncture where we think we should be more competitive and have room to take the rate again on a longer-term basis.\nTricia Griffith: And again, I'll reiterate. For the majority of the states, the 35 states where we're taking targeted rate decreases, they're small bite to the apple to kind of see what happened. Some states needed deeper decreases, but we're really looking at, like John said, the average is between 1.5 to 2% decreases. We're looking at all the data that could be changing. And what we know from the past and what we've always talked about with rate changes overall is our customers want stable rates. And obviously, that can always happen when you need to get rate like we do in the homeowners product, but that's really our goal here to understand the data as it changes and just be lockstep with what's needed to be competitive and grow.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, hey Tricia, I'm just curious on your thoughts on given the -- maybe the longer-term implications of the pandemic and stay-at-home and online shopping on how that might change the mix longer term of agency versus direct? And maybe, I guess, what used to be agency customers maybe more willing to become a direct customer?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. It's hard to say, Mike. I think that we're obviously seeing more now and the recovery is faster in the direct business on both Personal Auto and Commercial Auto. I think about it almost like I would have never bought groceries online before because I go to my little suburban town grocery store where I see my friends and it's comfortable. Well, now I'm doing that. I see where people, one, because it is -- a lot of these customers, a lot of these agents, I should say, are small businesses. And so they're reacting to get themselves set up and socially distant, and some people might not be as comfortable coming in. So I do think it's definitely changing now. I think it depends on how long this goes and how comfortably -- how comfortable people are. But it does show, I think, especially on the commercial side, that people are getting -- and then the majority of our business, by the way, in commercial has been through the agency channel. People are more comfortable buying small business insurance, etc., on the direct side. So we have seen it change. I can't commit that it will be a long-term change, but I do think it could be one factor in having people be much more comfortable buying insurance across the board in direct channel.\nMichael Phillips: OK. And then separately on the bundled product topic that's talked about a lot by many companies. Can you say, if you've been approached more by other -- other insurance companies, monoline companies, have you been approached more today than in the past to partner with them to offer home or to offer auto when they don't have auto?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think we're approached a lot in terms of that. And in our HomeQuote Explorer and our BusinessQuote Explorer, we work with a lot of different companies, unaffiliated partnerships to sell our home to our auto customers through, not just Progressive Home, but many different carriers and the same thing on the commercial side. So yes, we obviously want -- we want to care about the values of those companies, the brand of those companies to make sure when we partner that we feel good about it. And we always want to expand those, if we think it will be better for our customers, to be able to bundle their auto, even if -- auto and home, even if it's not with us. So yes, I think -- we're approached very regularly.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Just one follow-up. I hope you can hear me better. I think in the June results, you said you were positively surprised by the renewal auto applications and lower policy cancellations. Can you maybe -- now that you have a month of hindsight, can you maybe talk about what happened there? What's led to the surprise?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we're happy with retention. I think, obviously, during the COVID period through May 15th, for the most part, there were moratoriums on any cancellations and we had leniency going into play. And so we knew at some point, our customers on both the commercial side and the auto side would either have a big bill coming due or need our help to really kind of get through what could be a big hump and kind of get on course for their future payments for auto. So we had a process a really very detailed process in both our CRM organization on the commercial side and the auto side to personalize those things what our customers called, knowing that they would have what we call kind of big bills coming up and how we could help them to get through that payment plans, forgiveness, etc. And we were really happy to say that through that plan that we started in May 15th and has wrapped up more recently, on the private passenger auto side, we were able to salvage over 50% of those people that might have canceled. And maybe they would have canceled because they were shopping anyway, maybe they would have canceled because of finances related to COVID, but we were just happy that we were able to personalize that process and have those individuals maintain their coverage with Progressive.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Can you hear me?\nTricia Griffith: Yes.\nMike Zaremski: Okay great. Just a follow-up question, kind of along the lines of thinking -- starting to think about whether there's any kind of secular trends post COVID. Anything you guys are seeing on the efficiency side, whether it's LAE or expense ratio directly that you think might be done differently, maybe consumer preference, too, that could lead to some kind of benefits for Progressive or just broadly the industry going forward?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think the efficiency automatically go to claims, which is the big organization, that's really our product once it happens. And it can be -- you got to balance it with accuracy. So we've been testing photo estimates and video estimates from our customers for quite a long time. And this really -- this fast forwarded it because we weren't going to body shops. And so we have a much larger amount, much larger percentage of our auto claims going through, what I would call photo method of inspection. Some of it is from our customers, giving it themselves and they may or may not get it repaired. I would say, that's about 25%. And after COVID, post COVID, it's been about 55% coming from our network body shops. And so of course, you want to balance that efficiency of reps not having the windshield timer going out with accuracy. And so as we're starting to kind of come through the first wave of this, we are seeing some accuracy trends that we want to be able to have our people eventually site of car. So although it's not as efficient because they're going out, we think it's more accurate. So as an example, recently, we -- a lot of our managed repair reps that got into nonnetwork body shops to do the estimates, really want to be able to get out there. When you have a really hard hit incoming -- I was a claims adjuster, so you have a really hard hit, doing it from a photo or video are really tough because underneath that sheet metal, there could be a lot of damage. And you can see a little bit, but you can't really get there. So that causes more supplements, which, of course, is inefficient. So we've just recently talked to our managed repair reps because they've been asking, can we go back out? We have given them all the materials they need to be safe, whether it's mask or gloves and both. And it's completely voluntary. So if you do not feel like you want to go out, that is no problem. We -- our first protection is our employees, but they're going out to some of the nonnetwork shops to do the estimate by the car, and we think that will be a good balance of the efficiency with the accuracy. And of course, we have it set up where the car is outside, no one's with them, etc. So we're really protected. And if they go to a body shop and they see the people aren't wearing mask. We ask them to turn around. So I think we'll learn more about the efficiency of how many estimates post COVID can we do with technology? And we're always testing technology and artificial intelligence to understand that we have so many years of millions and millions of photos. Could we ultimately have very simple estimates actually almost ride themselves and so we've been testing that for a while. Again, I hope I'm answering the question, but it really is a balance of accuracy and efficiency. We're having a lot of learnings from COVID, which is you always want to take advantage of something that's not good to say, what did we learn from that? And how will we come out better and more efficient? And overall, we have goals for LAE and NAER. During this time, there's so much noise in the data because of excess capacity at this juncture and etc. But we care deeply about efficiency and care deeply about our cost structure because we know that in order to have competitive costs, we have to be very competitive on the expense side.\nDoug Constantine: That appears to have been our final question. So that concludes our event. Jason, I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes Progressive Corporation's second-quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the investor relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. I really wanted to actually introduce you to everyone. I know this is your first IR call and it's in a weird circumstance due to COVID. But I thought -- I know you've talked to a couple of people over the last month or so, and I've really enjoyed working with you. A little history of this role being really additive for the person in it, as well as Progressive, as you all know, Julia Hornack took her talents to St. Pete for Progressive Home. Patrick Brennan was a prior director of investor relations, who's now our treasurer and Matt Downing is our HR controller. So we pride ourselves on movement around the company. We think this is such a good role for Doug at this time in his career, it really helps both analysts, investors, Progressive and the individual. So Doug, could you tell us a little bit about your career? Great. Thanks, Doug. We are thrilled to be working with you. And of course, we do miss Julia. But we're glad to have you here. Jason, we're ready to take the first question. Thanks, Elyse. I won't talk about July, but I will talk about when we think about frequency, I'll state that June was lower than the full quarter at about 24%. So we are seeing them stabilize. We still -- it's very different depending on the state as well. So you can see vehicle miles travel go up. And then immediately, if things close down, they go back and forth. So we formed sort of a macroeconomic dashboard. We have a lot of data to look at that, and we react to that. And of course, I'll go into severity because the calendar period severity is very distorted by the drop in new features. So the mix difference compared to last year is very distorted as you see, unlikely with a lot of our competitors. They talked about this last quarter with PD. And remember, we report incurred versus paid. And some of our competitors report paid, as well as PCI. Same story on PD incurred, it's -- the supplements drove PD up about nine points. So when you look at those payments from prior quarters that were we're paying supplements on that frequency, the supplements in the numerator. And so those dollars are increased, where the incurred accounts are the denominator, and so that's where you'll see the difference. Same thing with BI, it's age inflate -- incurred severity about nine points this quarter. Average age of BIs are up about 7%, a little bit higher. So we look at the accident year trends being about 6 to 7%. PIP incurred is really reopens on supplements from PIP. And It accounts for about 25 points of frequency from -- again, from prior periods when frequency was normal. Now the oddest one in this quarter is really our collision incurred [indiscernible], and that is a -- the severity is negative on that. Mainly because when you look at Quarter 2 '20 -- or Quarter 2 '19, the frequency is down about 36%. And then as we thought about our plan because we had excess capacity in claims, we redeployed many different claims individuals. I think I talked last quarter about giving Ohio 100 members of our claims organization to adjudicate unemployment claims. We've also deployed claims people in our CRM organization as people are trying to kind of get their arms around their bills. We also redeployed about 100 people to our subrogation unit, which means that money is coming in. We have kind of full-court press on collecting money when we have liability disputes with our competition. And so that money has come in this quarter because we have 100 extra people actually doing that. And so that's really the -- how the severity trend has gone negative this quarter. So frequency, in June, we saw it abate a little bit to 24%. We'll watch it closely as things go, and we'll just react accordingly. Yes. I mean we're seeing more shopping, I think, specifically in the direct part of our business. And how we look at rates, when we took the -- when we had the credit, the $1 billion credit in April and May, that was sort of a, hey, we're -- this thing happened very quickly. COVID happened very quickly. We wanted to react. And now we're in the mode, really, we're back to grow as fast as we can at our target profit margins. But we're really trying to leverage, we believe we have, and that's industry-leading segmentation. So we are looking across the country, each product manager, state by state, channel by channel, product-by-product and being much more surgical when we're thinking about our rates. So as an example, in quarter two, we lowered rates and states that made up about half of our auto premium. And if you want to go from the beginning of COVID, take April through August rates that are in play, we'll -- we'll have reduced rates in 35 states that make up more than three quarters of our auto premium. That 35 states, that doesn't mean it's 35 revisions. It could be a few more because maybe we take smaller bites of the apple. I always think about -- think about segmentation and especially increasing rates, unless it's something where we need to react very quickly. I think about my predecessor, Glenn Renwick, who always said, three ones is better than one three. And so we are very, very surgically looking at each state and trying to determine the best rate to continue our growth and make sure that we also have our target profit margin. Does that help, Elyse? Yes, Thanks, Mike. What I can say is we know it was -- it's a herculean effort to get ready for that event, and we were ready. I will tell you -- and this is, of course -- this is really early because it went into effect July 2nd. I can tell you that we are very pleased with results in terms of growth. Again, we're going to have to watch this closely because individuals are going to choose to have PIP as it was before and not. So it's a little bit early to tell anything. We'll have a lot more data next quarter. What I can say from just looking at the early results, from a growth perspective, we are pleased. Yes. Mike, we have. We've seen it actually more on the agency side. So our direct side went up a couple of points, but leveled out. And of course, we already have a high percentage of take rate on our direct side -- and direct side. And our agency side, yes, it did tick up. And I think that makes a lot of sense because this is a great time to understand your rating equals one, and it's up about 12% on the agency side. So overall, about 40% on the direct side, about 12% on the agency side and so a little bit more than 20% overall. And I would say, I think, John, we a few quarters ago talked about -- or maybe as Karen talked about insurance being like the top -- one of the top three costs for those truckers. I think that that is really important. And we've seen trucking increasing based on COVID. I will also add, John talked about Smart Haul. We also have Snapshot Preview, which is available for our business auto and contractors. And although we don't have the data, it gives same upfront savings and fleet management. But we're encouraging -- we're encouraged, I should say, with the demand, and we think that will only increase. And we have that in about 40 states in our agency channel so far. Yes. So we're happy with our Robinsons growth. The agency channel is up a little bit over 18%, and the direct channel is up about 46%. I think our mix there is right around 10%, maybe a little bit lower. Our goal is to continue to have more bundled customers and so the goal is to have as many as we can. We want every auto customer in our book to be able to bundle when they have either a rental or a home, should that be other demographic. So we continue to push hard. You can obviously see it in our advertisement that we talk about protection in home. So our goal is continue to increase our numbers of Robinsons because we know they're stickier and give them reasons to stay based on the products and sources that we're able to provide. Yes, I'll start, David, by the caveat being, we really don't know because of all the different things that go into it. So schools reopening, cases going up, cases going down, vaccines, unemployment, work from home, all those things. So I'll start with that caveat. I will say with our Smart Haul data, we did see signs of congestion kind of flattening more recently. And we're starting to sort of look at data with that. And so we have some initial trends. And again, we're going to have to fine-tune these. So these are -- aren't perfect, but we're continuing to understand the measures of congestion, both on our Telematics on the commercial side, as well as our UBI on the auto side. So I'll give you a quick example. And again, these are going to change, but this is kind of how we look at it. So we've got -- vehicle miles traveled are up, not as up as much as they were this time last year. And obviously, losses haven't followed in particular. So we're trying to figure out the delta between those two. And what we have seen from a congestion perspective is that that does tell some of the delta. So on the UBI side, on the auto side, we believe that that congestion, the gap is about one point during morning rush hour and about nearly two and a half points on afternoon rush hour, which would take into account some of the differences in actually miles driven and accidents because less accidents happen when there's less congestion. Again, we're just digging into this as we have more and more. And the data changes and is very influenced about what states do depending on their rise or fall in cases. Yes. It was a little bit hard to hear, but I think what you were asking was how we would react to frequency from a rate change perspective. I think we take all the data into account. Frequency right now is just so hard -- it's always hard to predict, but it's even more difficult now with all the different inputs with COVID. Again, I'll go back to our stated goal, and we're going to try to grow as fast as we can. We'll look at all the trends and try to understand surgically, by channel, by product, how to continue to put our pedal on that growth mode while making sure we have our profit target margins. We never want to grow and just -- and not also have that profit come with it. So that's an important part. We want to make sure that we have competitive prices and growth. So the predicting frequency is going to be a real challenge for us in the near term just because of all the different inputs that are in a constant state of flux. Yes. I mean you saw the results. So we're -- we need to make sure that profit is a big part of what we're thinking about in terms of property. And so as you know, we have our new product 4.0 model that we're rolling out. The hail and wind that's happened from a cat perspective has been pretty -- very high. What we're concentrating on right now is to continue to have segmentation. So we continue to roll our 4.0 product out. In addition, we're making changes to the products. And that includes minimum deductibles and ACVs on roofs because that's what we see, especially in hail-ridden states. Underlying ex-CAT, we feel better about our movement in property. We feel pretty good about it, as well as the growth. But again, we want to make sure that we continue to roll out our segmentation. We want to continue to roll out minimum deductibles. And more importantly, make it easy for people to shop. So we have property in 45 states. Now in 17 of those states, you can buy through a tablet or a phone. So we're pretty excited about our investments in technology around that. John, do you want to add anything? Yes. In those 18 states on 4.0, I think 16 of them have the mandates that I referred to in terms of min deductibles in ACV. So we feel good about where we're going. We need to continue to concentrate on that. Yes. I feel like we're in a really nice competitive position for a couple of reasons. And we've had usage-based insurance for literally decades. And they've come in different forms, and we've continued to evolve as technology has evolved. So we have a lot of data to really understand that variable. And we continue to evolve. That's the best part. And it's not something that we sit still on. So we continue to evolve. I will say that start-ups are good competition because they're doing things that the consumers want. And we've always believed in the ability to rate a driver on their individual driving behavior. And so I think competition in that aspect is good. I think also where we have the benefit is in acquisition costs. If you are start-up, those acquisition costs are very expensive. We have a good base of auto customers, for renters in home, etc., and we're a known brand. So I feel like we're in a great position and we continue to add technology advances in our UBI, and I don't think you'll see that abated. Yes. I think as we introduce the mobile device, that has continued to increase. I think it's easy. I think people get it. They can see their information more readily. We still have a fair amount that we're on the Snapshot dongle. I think as we continue to look at the model of senior information upfront, and we're very early on in that, and we haven't really even advertised that, we've seen a really high take rates. I think people -- I think a couple of things. One, we're trusted brand that understands UBI 2, the situation with COVID. I think people are going to -- want to give their data more and more, especially if they're not driving, and they're working from home more often. I'll take the last part. Yes. I would agree with John. I would say when we look at the data we have for dongle also versus the mobile device is a little bit different as well because we're able to understand handheld versus hand free and not just -- in addition to the time of day, miles traveled and hard breaking. So we're also getting a little bit more data, but there's a little bit of a difference, but nothing that we're concerned about. I mean I think everybody took a decision when we went through COVID on what to do and no one company had it perfect because the data was ever changing, it was very new. So I feel like GEICO is a great competitor. They took a different stance than we did in terms of taking the two credits in April and May. I feel very comfortable in our ability to continue to grow. And especially as the end came to the second quarter. So we've increased our advertising in auto about 12% this quarter. So that kind of tells you that we're very much in play for new business. We believe times like this, where there's disruption is really when we win in marketplace. And so we're -- although we hate the fact that this is happening to our country, we believe a lot more people will shop. And our goal is to have very competitive rates and great service once you're with us. Well, the severity and the development is really -- it has been based on similar topics that we talked about before in terms of increased medical cost in the marketplace, higher attorney rep and newer features and then our mix of business going to for-hire trucking, which is a higher severity than business auto and contractors. And when you look at the quarter two reserve development in Commercial Lines, about 44 million really came from about four states, those states being big states. And so when you look at our overall -- year-to-date development overall, you can see Commercial Lines is the biggest part of that 116 million at 98 million. So we continue to watch that from the Commercial Lines perspective. Frequency is down as well. But we -- it's very much like I've talked about in prior quarters with specific states and those variables in terms of medical costs, attorney rep and our mix of business changing. Yes. I mean, T&C, we talk about our T&C, and we took our premium down by 29 million this month. So we're definitely seeing less driving, but in terms of the development piece, that really is about higher BI limits and our adjusters' reserve going up as well. It's a thing we talked about before. I don't have it with me, but it's been -- it's pretty flat. I think our average written premium. The rate, you mean or rate of increase? Between 1 and 2%. Yes, personal auto. Yes. Sorry. Yes. I mean I think that when we look at -- we also want to add in new apps there. So our new apps in direct are also in conversion, we had some increased ad spend as well. I think conversion is down about 2% with quotes up 6%. It's -- the data is ever-changing because we do believe more people are shopping. But like I said, we spent more in the direct auto. And we feel comfortable with our new apps being up at 4% on the direct side and especially increasing toward the latter part of the quarter. And again, I'll reiterate. For the majority of the states, the 35 states where we're taking targeted rate decreases, they're small bite to the apple to kind of see what happened. Some states needed deeper decreases, but we're really looking at, like John said, the average is between 1.5 to 2% decreases. We're looking at all the data that could be changing. And what we know from the past and what we've always talked about with rate changes overall is our customers want stable rates. And obviously, that can always happen when you need to get rate like we do in the homeowners product, but that's really our goal here to understand the data as it changes and just be lockstep with what's needed to be competitive and grow. Yes. It's hard to say, Mike. I think that we're obviously seeing more now and the recovery is faster in the direct business on both Personal Auto and Commercial Auto. I think about it almost like I would have never bought groceries online before because I go to my little suburban town grocery store where I see my friends and it's comfortable. Well, now I'm doing that. I see where people, one, because it is -- a lot of these customers, a lot of these agents, I should say, are small businesses. And so they're reacting to get themselves set up and socially distant, and some people might not be as comfortable coming in. So I do think it's definitely changing now. I think it depends on how long this goes and how comfortably -- how comfortable people are. But it does show, I think, especially on the commercial side, that people are getting -- and then the majority of our business, by the way, in commercial has been through the agency channel. People are more comfortable buying small business insurance, etc., on the direct side. So we have seen it change. I can't commit that it will be a long-term change, but I do think it could be one factor in having people be much more comfortable buying insurance across the board in direct channel. Yes. I think we're approached a lot in terms of that. And in our HomeQuote Explorer and our BusinessQuote Explorer, we work with a lot of different companies, unaffiliated partnerships to sell our home to our auto customers through, not just Progressive Home, but many different carriers and the same thing on the commercial side. So yes, we obviously want -- we want to care about the values of those companies, the brand of those companies to make sure when we partner that we feel good about it. And we always want to expand those, if we think it will be better for our customers, to be able to bundle their auto, even if -- auto and home, even if it's not with us. So yes, I think -- we're approached very regularly. Well, we're happy with retention. I think, obviously, during the COVID period through May 15th, for the most part, there were moratoriums on any cancellations and we had leniency going into play. And so we knew at some point, our customers on both the commercial side and the auto side would either have a big bill coming due or need our help to really kind of get through what could be a big hump and kind of get on course for their future payments for auto. So we had a process a really very detailed process in both our CRM organization on the commercial side and the auto side to personalize those things what our customers called, knowing that they would have what we call kind of big bills coming up and how we could help them to get through that payment plans, forgiveness, etc. And we were really happy to say that through that plan that we started in May 15th and has wrapped up more recently, on the private passenger auto side, we were able to salvage over 50% of those people that might have canceled. And maybe they would have canceled because they were shopping anyway, maybe they would have canceled because of finances related to COVID, but we were just happy that we were able to personalize that process and have those individuals maintain their coverage with Progressive. Yes. Well, I think the efficiency automatically go to claims, which is the big organization, that's really our product once it happens. And it can be -- you got to balance it with accuracy. So we've been testing photo estimates and video estimates from our customers for quite a long time. And this really -- this fast forwarded it because we weren't going to body shops. And so we have a much larger amount, much larger percentage of our auto claims going through, what I would call photo method of inspection. Some of it is from our customers, giving it themselves and they may or may not get it repaired. I would say, that's about 25%. And after COVID, post COVID, it's been about 55% coming from our network body shops. And so of course, you want to balance that efficiency of reps not having the windshield timer going out with accuracy. And so as we're starting to kind of come through the first wave of this, we are seeing some accuracy trends that we want to be able to have our people eventually site of car. So although it's not as efficient because they're going out, we think it's more accurate. So as an example, recently, we -- a lot of our managed repair reps that got into nonnetwork body shops to do the estimates, really want to be able to get out there. When you have a really hard hit incoming -- I was a claims adjuster, so you have a really hard hit, doing it from a photo or video are really tough because underneath that sheet metal, there could be a lot of damage. And you can see a little bit, but you can't really get there. So that causes more supplements, which, of course, is inefficient. So we've just recently talked to our managed repair reps because they've been asking, can we go back out? We have given them all the materials they need to be safe, whether it's mask or gloves and both. And it's completely voluntary. So if you do not feel like you want to go out, that is no problem. We -- our first protection is our employees, but they're going out to some of the nonnetwork shops to do the estimate by the car, and we think that will be a good balance of the efficiency with the accuracy. And of course, we have it set up where the car is outside, no one's with them, etc. So we're really protected. And if they go to a body shop and they see the people aren't wearing mask. We ask them to turn around. So I think we'll learn more about the efficiency of how many estimates post COVID can we do with technology? And we're always testing technology and artificial intelligence to understand that we have so many years of millions and millions of photos. Could we ultimately have very simple estimates actually almost ride themselves and so we've been testing that for a while. Again, I hope I'm answering the question, but it really is a balance of accuracy and efficiency. We're having a lot of learnings from COVID, which is you always want to take advantage of something that's not good to say, what did we learn from that? And how will we come out better and more efficient? And overall, we have goals for LAE and NAER. During this time, there's so much noise in the data because of excess capacity at this juncture and etc. But we care deeply about efficiency and care deeply about our cost structure because we know that in order to have competitive costs, we have to be very competitive on the expense side."

            "content": "And Mike, I would add that we have UBI in our commercial business as well. And take rate there is very strong. And we're seeing great trends around our for-hire segments in terms of their take rate and their own renewal rate as well. So we are broadening our UBI deployment and really pleased with what we're seeing in commercial lines. We have not provided our take rate on Smart Haul and our commercial business. But I would just tell you, it's exceeded our expectations out of the gate. And the other thing I would mention is that these truckers are required to have the recording devices in their vehicles by federal law. So we don't have the barrier of getting a device into the car or getting an app downloaded. We get the information directly from third-party providers of those devices in the trucks. So it is a pretty good proposition to a trucker who can get a significant discount on a premium, which is a pretty significant premium. So again, I would point to those items without pointing to a number and say, we're pretty pleased with [indiscernible]. And a little bit on that percentage. So a little higher in direct. We've been at it a little longer in the direct channel, but we've been really pleased with the Robinsons growth we've been able to achieve with Progressive Home, but that's behind where the direct channel is today. But if you blend them together, you come to a number, a little below 10%. I can elaborate a little bit there. So a rate filing, depending upon the size of your state is going to look at data, sometimes going back a year, sometimes going back three years. But you're trying to project the trend going forward because you're trying to price to a point in the future. So you can look backwards, which we do. But ultimately, what we're trying to do is price forward. So it's a little tricky at this juncture given the anomalies we're seeing due to COVID. So it's a great question as to how much of that we actually include on a going-forward assumption basis versus exclude because we think it's a one-off that will not be in plate down the road. So it really depends upon the robustness of the program we're pricing to and I look forward as to what we think we're going to be experiencing when those premiums are in effect, which can be for the next year to two. Sure. Yes. Unlike the vehicle programs, especially personal auto, where we've been getting rates more competitive. We're taking rates up in home. So the segmentation is really important. And I think we've got about 18 states out with our next-generation 4.0 product, which is fantastic. We're also increasing rates. We're taking them up almost 6% year-to-date. And we're obviously not hitting our profitability targets. But you also recognize that if you're looking at cat losses year-to-date, we changed from the aggregate stop-loss agreement that we employed last year, which was essentially a cat loss plus LAE ratio to a retention of 375 million of hail losses, effectively hail, wind, a nonnamed storm, and we're yet to hit that retention level. So if you adjust that, and if you assume that we are under the same agreement we had last year to a combined ratio that would be below 100, but still well above our target margins there, so we are taking actions, as Tricia noted, and we're also changing rates. I'd just add a little bit to that. The usage-based model today that we predominantly employ applies discounts in the personal space basically at the first renewal point. We gave a participation discount upfront. Increasingly, we are getting that data upfront. And in Commercial Lines, we're always getting that data upfront and that's really the Root model. You might recall that, I don't know, five years ago or so, we rolled out what we called Snapshot Test Drive, which was a model where you get the driving behavior before you price the policy. We are doing that now with third parties that are -- such as OEMs, such as other app providers. And we are now deploying what we call Snapshot Road Test, which is a model where you download the app, we see your driving behavior, and we employ those discounts at new business, similar to our Commercial Lines model. So I think you'll gradually see migration to employing the driving data where available upfront and we think we're very well positioned for that transition. On the property side, I will point out that we have for a number of years now been the No.1 provider of homeowners quotes and the No.1 provider of renters quotes online. And as Tricia mentioned, brand is a big driver in all of the insurance space, and we think it is a key lever to have acquisition costs in a place that are feasible to make money over the long term. I think you're asking about the accuracy of the data from a dongle versus the mobile app, you're breaking up a little bit. There are differences, for sure. Technology, as you can imagine, continues to evolve in the mobile space and pretty quickly. So there are definitely differences, but we are very confident that we can adequately price folks based on the mobile data. And the data that is coming directly from vehicles is growing as well. And that's obviously as robust as you can get. So we're very comfortable between mobile and dongle in terms of ability to price accurately. And like it was just discussed, it is a lower cost option, and can afford also continuous monitoring, if we so chose to do that as well. So a little different, but not materially. So it's way I would characterize it. We're having a lot of trouble hearing you or understanding. Can you say that one again? Sure. Sure. Some commentary there. It's very powerful rating variable. However, today, because not everyone takes the Snapshot option, we solve that last in terms of our algorithms. So we solve for all the other rating variables because all the customers will be rated on those rating variables and then we solve secondarily for Snapshot. So even though we would see it being our most powerful rating variable, one could surmise that if we solve for it first, it would be an even more powerful rating variable. But again, because we don't require everybody to take that option, we solve it last. Does that answer your question? That will vary at the customer level. So based on where you live and the other demographics of the household, as you can imagine, for more preferred households, it's going to be different than for more nonstandard households, young, old, etc., and urban and rural as well. So we don't provide an absolute percentage for you. Minus 1%. A little over minus 1% [indiscernible] for personal auto. We've taken commercial up a little over 2% and property I mentioned was almost 6%. As Tricia noted, we are taking targeted rate decreases. So we have product managers generally who are managing a state or two, and they are very focused on where they sit competitively or watching conversion in their markets, and they're taking targeted cuts largely at this juncture where we think we should be more competitive and have room to take the rate again on a longer-term basis."

These documents can be found on our Web site, investors.progressive.com. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith will make some introductory comments, Tricia.\nTricia Griffith: Good morning. Before we open up for your Q&A, I'd like to make just a few remarks of how Progressive has responded to COVID-19 because I'm extraordinarily proud of my team and the nearly 43,000 people that make Progressive incredible company and culture that we all enjoy. As you know, with our incredible growth over the past several years, I've had the opportunity to welcome thousands of new people into progressive. I take an hour to meet with new hires and talk about our core values in our culture. I sometimes struggle describing our special culture because it is somewhat indescribable. So I usually say that it becomes crystal clear when something really great happens or when there is a crisis. This unprecedented situation has allowed all of our Progressive family to visibly live our core values and completely understand why this is such a unique place. The actions we've taken for both our employees and customers have absolutely created and reinforced their loyalty to Progressive. Let me walk you through a few specifics. We immediately determined the needs of each of our constituents and started to develop plans forming teams to address each party. We've named the program, the Apron Relief Program, a nod to our brand icon it symbolizes protection and strength. Let me start with our employee base. We knew we needed to get the majority of our employees home to be able to work and take care of our customers. We immediately put into play our business continuity plan to protect our people. Currently, 95% of our workforce is working from home and for the employees that need to continue to come into the office, we've adjusted the workspaces to increase social distances, and we've intensified our cleaning measures. We also knew that even though every Progressive employee has a job and many of them have spouses and significant others that aren't as fortunate. In order to help our employees to have financial confidence, we paid our non-equity employees a portion of their annual gain share bonus in April. We also have created and committed $2 million to the Progressive employee relief fund to assist our employees experiencing hardships. Our employees have really appreciated the communication from every level of leaders at Progressive. I send a weekly video from my home and have literally received thousands of notes from our employees. I'll share one that will give you a sense of the sentiments. In a time of uncertainty, I want to let you know your videos in Progressive had been so encouraging and uplifting. I've never been prouder to be part of our Progressive family. I bleed blue and orange, but all that we are doing during this most difficult time to help each other and others is inspiring. Thank you for taking the time to be so honest and for opening your home and family to all of us. It's refreshing seeing you and your family's experiences are similar to ours. I love your journey through the years at Progressive and how approachable and friendly, I've always been. I know we try to be not what you expect an insurance company for our customers. But I'm very grateful and proud that is also for our employees. And I received so many of those. The customers that were privileged to serve need us now more than ever. We are providing premium credits of 20% to personal auto policies in force at the end of April and May, which amount to approximately $1 billion. In addition, we temporarily suspended cancellations and non-renewals on personal and commercial lines policy, paused collection activities and have deferred some deductibles. We also provided delivering meals for our 400 trucking customers, first responders and health care providers. I'll share one of the many comments we received from the first responder. I'm so impressed with Progressive and what they are doing about the COVID situation. You guys are really helping our customers and even providing food to our table. Thank you. These kinds of things make you want to stay with the company forever. For our communities we've given $8 million of donations to charities focused on hunger, health and homelessness. I recently received a call from Claire, the CEO of Feeding America, and she was so thankful that we were providing meals to so many who need them now more than ever. I also recently received a letter from Gail the CEO of the American Red Cross. I'll read a short excerpt. I wanted to reach out to you with a personal note to express my most sincere appreciation for the Progressive Insurance Foundation's recent and truly impactful gift to the Red Cross and powering the continued delivery of our life saving mission nationwide and then the Coronavirus outbreak. As our humanitarian organization continues to adapt to meet the new challenges presented by this pandemic, your generosity ensures that Red Cross is there to provide vital blood and disaster relief services to people around the U.S. who rely on us when they win help can't wait. We also care immensely about our partners and helping them get through this trying time. For our body shops and independent agent partners, it's about loyalty, but it's also about minimizing the disruption of our supply chain as we get on the other side of this crisis. For more than 35,000 independent agents, we are partnering with agent associations to provide over $2.5 million in grants to help agents address new challenges presented by the virus, and we're also administering internal fund to provide additional targeted relief to our agents. Additionally, we've made over $40 million available to agents by advancing performance bonus payments to more than 4500 of our agents. While the opt-in period is still open on today, we've had over 1600 agents opt-in for a total of $20 million. In addition, we sent $1,000 to each of our network body shops to use as a soft pad. We saw this is another opportunity to help when they needed it most and show them how much we value them. One shop owner called in tears to tell us how much that was appreciated. Lastly, we aren't sitting still and have our eyes focused on the future. In fact, we formulated three distinct scopes of work outlined under constructs we call resolve, return and reimagine. Resolve, first and foremost, we are addressing the immediate challenges COVID-19 presents to our workforce, customers, agents, communities and other stakeholders. Return, next, we are creating detailed plans to return business back to scale quickly as the virus evolves, lasting impact are more understood and effects become clearer. Reimagine, lastly, we have formed several teams under this category and the goal is to understand how the environment may shift and reimagine the next normal and how we can position ourselves to flourish. All of this to say our shareholders should feel very confident that we've got this covered for the short, medium and long-term. Our resilience is shining brighter than ever and we will come out of this stronger that I'm confident in. Thank you and now we'll take the first question.\nJulia Hornack: Jake please go ahead with the remainder of the script.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nTricia Griffith: I'm going to give Jake just a moment to allow additional callers into the question queue. But so I'll get started with the first question, which is can you talk about the current shifts in automotive automobile usage and potential shifts in automobile usage as the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and the resulting impact to Progressive? Well, absolutely, let me start with our usage based insurance data because it is continues to evolve as the shelter and place orders are lifted. So we saw abrupt declines in miles driven in mid-March. And by the end of the month and the daily driving for vehicle miles travelled was 40% lower than pre-COVID baselines. And then, in the first few days of May, we started to see some broad based increase in driving and I'll give you a little bit more on that. So last week, and we actually saw driving only down 14% countrywide versus pre-COVID. Now that changes and even up to this Monday we saw around 20%, 25%. So we are definitely seeing in states where the shelter in place has lifted we're seeing driving continue to be to increase and we're really following it on a daily basis. So I would say the level of data I'd normally don't show this level of data, but we're really literally watching it state by state and day by day to understand driving behavior. The reductions we're seeing are almost entirely due to changes in number of trips and not the length of trips. And I think, overall, I can't tell you what will happen in the future because these times are so uncertain. But the fact that we have this knowledge of the driving behavior, I think has been really important for us, as we understand sort of long-term trends.\nJohn Sauerland: I will just add to that, obviously, everyone is wondering how fast this company is back? Does it come back to the same level of miles travelled as pre-COVID, and we're obviously trying to assess that as well. We believe there may be some trends around lower usage of public transportation over the longer term. They're also think there must be some substitution effect from air travel to vehicle travels for longer trips. And we'll be watching this carefully over time. And if we continue to see opportunities to give credits to our customers, we'll do that. But we are going to take it on a sort of a month by month and a geographically specific basis. Obviously, our product managers at Progressive are a huge competitive advantage for us, while we've taken a broad swath to date. We think the right path forward is likely a more surgical approach to any further credits.\nTricia Griffith: Great. Thanks for that date. Jake, can we please go to the first question in the queue, please?\nOperator: Our first question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Tricia, you guys have done a great job over the years, this is a non-COVID question. A great job over the years of kind of becoming more efficient and lowering this -- your non-acquisition expense ratio. And I guess just curious over the longer term, how much juice you think is left in that, so you can improve that?\nTricia Griffith: Well, it's hard to give a certain percentage Michael, but we will care deeply to continue to care about costs because, this is a -- it's a competitive environment. That has always been one of our four pillars when we talk about our strategy of becoming consumers' number one choice, so we'll continue to care about cost. And from a media perspective, we will spend media when we think it's efficient. This has been sort of a strange time because a lot of our media spend has -- is normally in live sports, et cetera. So obviously, in March, it went down a little bit because of that. But from an efficiency perspective, we are constantly thinking of ways to take unnecessary costs out of the system, to be able to have competitive prices for our customers. Can't tell you the exact amount but we talked about it all the time on my team.\nMichael Phillips: Follow up is just, I guess curious to hear your thoughts on how you think just the overall market, personal auto market pricing arm would be once we get out of COVID and kind of back to normal, maybe 2021 or whatever that is, but what you think the impact of this would be on a normal state back into the auto pricing market?\nTricia Griffith: I wish I had that crystal ball. I think all the good companies are thinking about right now, getting consumers back, some of the money from the premiums because of the reduction in driving. Again, we're seeing that reduction go to less levels and we saw initially in March so we will price it. And one of the reasons that we did credits was because the fact that, we care a lot about segmentation and making sure that a lot of variables that we use, were price try and so we didn't want to kind of mess up that and I think all the good companies will do that and we will be competitive. And we will think about all the things that are important in terms of continued segmentation. So even during this time, whether it's on the personal line side or the commercial line side, we have been focused on continuing with our product models understanding right to risk, understanding our cost structure, making sure our brand has evolved and all those things together, I believe I can only speak on behalf of Progressive. I think we will come out of this stronger and be able to continue to capture share as we've had in the last 3, 4 years.\nOperator: We have a question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: In the last earnings release and I believe in the Q2 you talked about a 200,000 policyholders electing the billing leniency option. As of March 31, do you expect that number to increase a lot? And I assume that number was correlated with the kind of uncertain, I can't believe -- I can't recall you called it but a kind of maybe the potential bad debt expense you also charged you took in your March results.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So a lot of that is from the leniency and then we through March 15, we didn't cancel for non-pay. So, that we will expect that to increase, we're not going to share the exact amount. But here's what we're really trying to do. I think this is an important piece, Mike. In John Murphy's CRM organization, they're really working closely to personalize it with each customer. And we're trying to make sure that if they couldn't pay for a certain period of time, how do we get them back on track, we want people to be legal, we want people to have insurance, we want to be really flexible with each and every customer that happens to. So we have those 200,000 customers, that -- the payments will start to come due, we'll work with them to try to design coverage that they're able to stay, insurance insured with Progressive. And John Murphy's team is working literally many, many hours in many days, it's just to think about this in his team. And in fact, the CRM organization has been quite busy because we're doing a lot of personalization, a lot of consultation with our customers at this time, when they really need to understand how they can stay legal. And we actually have a couple hundred people from our claims organization who had worked in CRM at one point moving over to be able to counsel those customers. So retention is going to be as important as ever, we don't know how many people we will lose or that won't have insurance for a while. There's so many different variables in terms of what is happening in our customers lives, but our goal is to keep as many as we can and we are going to do that as much we can. And put so much work into that to make sure that our retention stays the same.\nJohn Sauerland: Mike, I will just add. Clearly the 200,000 is through the end of March and leniency goes through May 15. So we won't cancel anyone for non-payment or renew them through May 15. Starting May 15, customers will be getting bills that will be for the balance outstanding for the period in which we planned our leniency as well as the upcoming months. So, we will be working very hard as Tricia mentioned, our customer relationship management organization to make sure we keep those customers. If you're trying to estimate what bad debt write-offs were being through April through May that's a fair thing to do for sure. We're not providing numbers in terms of additional people that we are providing leniency to at this point, but it's safe to assume that it is more than 200,000 as of end of March. And it will be -- a difficult challenge, frankly, to estimate what portion of that we won't collect. This is unprecedented. Of course, we normally have bad debt expense routines, unexposed premium, those really don't apply in this case, it's very different situation. So we will be making some estimates. And the good news is, due to our monthly releases, you will have clarity around that for April and just a couple --\nTricia Griffith: May 20. Yes, I mean, we watched the hardships kind of unfold. And so, I mean, we care a lot about that. I have to tell you a story that just came to me yesterday. And this is back to my culture comment. Mike, so woman from CRM was talking to one of our customers that couldn't pay for May and we're talking -- she was talking through leniency and our CRM rep and I don't always want this to happen, but I think this is a beautiful story. Our CRM rep paid a premium for May out of her own pocket, which to me is like, that's an incredible tribute to our culture and having somebody listening to a customer and doing the right thing. Now, of course, I don't want that to happen all the time. It's an extraordinary example. I think is a good example of our culture. And we're going to do whatever we can to make sure that we understand the hardships going forward. And the most important thing is to make sure that people stay legal and have insurance and we hope it's a Progressive.\nMike Zaremski: Tricia that's helpful. It's amazing that your colleague did that. Lastly, Tricia, I think you mentioned the gain share factor earlier. It's clearly a very important metric for your colleagues, when they think about their potential bonuses. It's also been an important metric for investors to gauge Progressive success, and I don't think it's disclosed anymore kind of curious why is that the case?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we disclosed it publicly because it was correlated with our dividend policies. So we've had it internally forever when we change the dividend policy to have that reflected in our gains share score is a piece of the formula. We shared publicly. So we started not doing that when we changed the dividend policy last year. So what we did this year was we looked at the gain share for the quarter, we took in conservative estimates. So we didn't go to the full number that we thought it would be on basically to make sure that we gave the employees that needed most some of their bonus that we believe, is not at risk. Of course, again, we don't know what'll happen at the end of the year, lots of things can happen, but we won't share the gains share publicly going forward, especially since we have monthly earnings release. And we've also even gotten more disclosures on that in terms of caps and in our approach to how we look at caps on a monthly basis.\nOperator: We have a question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on new business. When you guys reported your March results, you had pointed to a good slowdown, kind of in the back half of the month as individuals weren't shopping on, even, during kind of the COVID situation. Have you seen any change in April? And then I guess, maybe combined with that question, because it's also on new business, we've seen others in the space kind of elect to give their refunds related to COVID in different ways, right, some just, sending money in the mail and some waiting till business comes up for renewal. Do you think that that kind of difference of, kind of refund, when it's given will also have an impact on new business, not just for Progressive, maybe that's more just industry comments as well.\nTricia Griffith: Those are good questions, Elyse. So we have seen I'll have Pat Callahan, add in a little bit on this and John Barbagallo, if he want too as well because it's a little bit different during depending on the business marketing tier in commercial, but we have seen some uptick in shopping. Usually during disruptive times, you'll start to see that. Again, there's so many variables going on. So we know that a cohort of people in America have gotten some portion of their tax refund or their tax benefits from COVID. We've always seen shopping in times like this and we're watching it closely on the private passenger auto side. And in commercial, it's very different, if you're talking about business auto versus trucking, and I will have John Barbagallo talk a little bit about that. But the uptick hasn't been extraordinary, but we are seeing it, so we're taking every day to point to understand how during this disruptive time, we can have competitive prices. Pat, you want to add in some more detail on that.\nPat Callahan: Sure. We definitely seen a rebound from the immediate lows during the shutdown or the shelter in place. We have seen a different recovery by channel as well, where we've seen a faster recovery on the direct side of the business than we have an agency because we expected agents offices are still somewhat disrupted. And, we do see just a lower recovery from our agency channel.\nTricia Griffith: John, you want to?\nJohn Barbagallo: Yes, sure. Elyse on the small business side, the demand function is pretty well correlated with what's going on in the economy. So we saw very definite demand shocks. And similar to personal auto, we are starting to see that come back nicely. We're still on a year-over-year basis below where we'd expect to be, especially given what is normally a peak season, this is somewhat seasonal business, but we are seeing recovery. The other thing is, and Tricia alluded to this, different businesses were affected very differently by COVID. So, I'll give one example in our truck where we have good telematics data through our smart haul program. About a third of our truckers actually saw an increase in miles driven. And then they tend to be kind of drive freight agriculture, livestock calling, but about 7%, 8% of them completely shut down. So, if you're an auto hauler, you're not real busy right now. And, so we monitored kind of not only kind of on a state level, on a BMT level, but we even go down to kind of industry class codes. And we see things very differently. And they will respond to that, the data continue to emerge.\nTricia Griffith: And for your question on sort of policy credits in our customer accounts, obviously, we have those April and May and we're always assessing, I went through the UBI data, we're assessing that more now on a state-by-state basis because of the different shelter in place orders and what will happen. And so going forward, I think that'll -- it'll be key for us to do what we do best in terms of by state, by channel, by product to understand the differences that have happened from COVID-19 and then react to those. It's hard to say what will happen from an industry perspective, because I think different companies handle it differently. But we'll go back to -- I'm really trying to understand it on a more granular level, depending on the state, the channel the product.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys gave some good data in terms of seeing, miles driven by down around 14%. Last weekend, I think you said relative to kind of pre-COVID levels and then Monday 20 to 25, right? So still varying but not down as much as I guess like the tail end of March. You did see April kind of in line with the end of March, or did you start to see, I guess some of this not like returned to pre-COVID levels but a little bit of a bounce back and driving levels. Did you see that towards the end of April, or is this something that you just started to see in May?\nTricia Griffith: That bounced back started about mid-April, mid to late April started the bounce back to about 25%. And right now, we think we're between 20 and 25. That 14% was specifically just to kind of show you like the detail that we look at for a weekend. So take Monday's data of this past Monday that was 21%. So we're right around that point. And again, it varies wildly depending on the states in terms of their restrictions. So if you look at a New York, it's very different than a Georgia. And so that's really how we're looking at it. The New York Times puts out sort of what's happening with restrictions being lifted. And we look at that and it seems to mirror some of the things we've seen. Of course, we don't have all the data that's in there, but we believe that's a correlation. So we think this next, two weeks, three weeks will be really interesting because so many states are starting to live, starting to open up and of course, depending on what happens with cases and testing that may change but I mean, just anecdotally, I was talking to Dan Mascaro, our Chief Legal Officer on Monday, and he went to hike in the metro parks in Cleveland. And he said it was so crowded. So you start to see this rare sunshine in Cleveland and people get out and they start to drive. And like Mike Johnson, we have a lot of theories that we play around with on my team to think about, okay, this summer, will people -- will you drive to grandma's house or to wherever versus fly? Could there be an increase in those longer trips? And of course, that has different frequency as well. So yes, I would say anywhere between right now we're seeing 20 to 25, but we started to see that mid-April.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I had a question about the premium median fees because I remember, in the past tracking non-payment of premium was itself an underwriting tool and I'm wondering whether that visibility is being dampened by obviously, I think necessary grace period extension?\nTricia Griffith: Not sure if I understand your question. John, you wan to take that?\nJohn Sauerland: I think that I can try. If I'm off-base what are you trying to get to please redirect. So we do perhaps look at payment patterns on current and incoming customers as a portion of a set of data that we look at when we are underwriting both new business as well as renewals. Is that the direction you're taking the question?\nMeyer Shields: Yes. In other words, is it less predictive now?\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. So that's a great question. And similarly with our snapshot data patterns have changed dramatically relative to fairly normal and very predictable datasets over time. So, yes, that will be a challenge for us. We are making exceptions in our underwriting today around new businesses, especially where we can pull data sets from common sources that the industry contributes to look at previous insurance ownership patterns. And, yes, that's been disrupted. And in the near term, I think it's fair to say, there will be a period where we probably have to exclude over the longer term run. I think the snapshot or vehicle usage based data will fall into the same camp. So it's really difficult to read right now. But you're right that is a underwriting variable that we have used and I would say in the interim, we are redirecting a bit. But in the long-term, we think we will continue to use that -- the underwriting we've done we think, has been a huge benefit to us in terms of avoiding new business that we probably are going to price accurately.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Sorry about that Meyer. I wasn't sure about it. But, yes, I think we'll continue to use that. And I think it's also only one variable that we use when we look at the sort of holistic rates to risk. But again, during these times, there's going to be a lot of data that will skew things that we'll have to kind of understand as we think about pricing and risks going forward.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. That was clear. So that's very helpful. The second question, as we seen the claim frequency decline, is there any offset in terms of maybe the gap between pre-virus average speeds and how people are driving now?\nTricia Griffith: I've seen a lot of data around speeds and anecdotally driving here today, there was a lot of people that were going really fast because there weren't very many on the highway. So I kind of made a note of that. What we've observed is, so we looked at hard brakes for 100 miles driven and the percentage of trips with time with their phone in their hand, we've seen that increase about 10% to 15% after the post-COVID-19. So it could suggest that the miles are riskier. We are not seeing that in the claims data yet. So we're going to be watching that closely.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Couple of questions here for you. First, I'm curious, I know it's a real new product here for you. But the Atlas product, does it have business interruption coverage in it? And if so, do you have virus exclusions in there as well, and this situation at all, make you think about the design of your product and potentially changing it?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think you'd refer to as our Bob product Atlas service, yes, behind it. Yes. Well, so for Bob products, we have less than 200 of those policies that have business interruption insurance, and we have an exclusion for damages caused by virus or bacteria in those. We use ISO verbiage. So we feel like our risk is very, very low, less than 200 policies and we have an exclusion. I do want to say as long as we're talking about this, as a leader in the U.S., P&C marketplace, we're very actively involved in ensuring the COVID pandemic doesn't result in legislative or regulatory actions that permanently damage the voluntary insurance market and slow our nation's economic recovery. The U.S. markets heavily regulated and we want to ensure carriers provide essential products that comply with the applicable regulations. So when they're developing and filing these program, the voluntary insurance market relies heavily, we rely heavily on contracts sanctity, and that's a really important piece that we believe in. And we have to ensure that so that we have adequate prices for all included exposures. So when you think about the economic damage that is, is tragic for small business, we don't believe that fabricating coverage that doesn't exist on insurance policies is the right solution for this problem. That said, we have little exposure if any but as an industry, we feel very passionate about the fact of contract sanctity.\nBrian Meredith: And then another quick question here, with respect to your homeowners product and just curious, how do you deal with a situation where the insurance payment is tied with a mortgage and with respect to mortgage forbearance, so it may not be your decision with respect to -- when ultimately the insurance payment comes in. Could be that just the bank extending mortgage prevents?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I don't know if I have a specific answer to that. Normally, when its part of the mortgage, it's less likely to not be paid because it has to be part of that and so it's just a pass-through.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. It's generally paid up front, in the mortgage. So while, the forbearance might postpone payments to the bank, generally speaking, the insurance hasn't paid upfront in that situation.\nBrian Meredith: Now I get that but I mean, if it's part of you would get -- you wouldn't necessarily get the mortgage forbearance and you may not necessarily get your premium?\nJohn Sauerland: While the premium again is generally speaking, paid upfront, so then the payment from the customer to the bank, the bank would be in that case, short on the money because the bank is generally recorded the entire insurance premium to us at the inception of that policy.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. They would have collected via escrow and put a year of homeowners insurance aside exactly for these types of either late payments or forbearance, to escrow directly.\nBrian Meredith: Perfect, perfect. And just one quick one. How do you think about [indiscernible] in these types of situations?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I'd have to watch it. I know we have a lot of history. But no history is like this. And so we look back and times like -- during the financial crisis, et cetera. And so we'll just have to follow the trends and then we're after them.\nJulia Hornack: Yes. If you let Yaron Kinar into the question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Yaron, your line open.\nYaron Kinar: A couple of questions. One, you mentioned that frequency has started to pick up from its mid-March to mid-April trough. Have you seen any change in severity corresponding to that change?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. The severity has been a little bit different for us. First of all, we report encouraged trends instead of paid trends. So for frequency, the incurred is more responsive and for severity both incurred and paid are more impacted by sudden changes in data. And so that may not be a true reflection of our trends. So, my opinion on severity right now, I can't necessarily tell, partly because the incurred counts distort the severity trends. Let me give you an example. So our property damage for the quarter was about 14% on severity trends. We think about 9 points to that, how to deal with trends that we've been seeing in the past, total loss repairables. What we think of the other 5% is really applied to supplement dollars that came in March from prior months, subrogation dollars from other companies from prior months. And when you apply those to March, they increase the encouraged severity. So we think that trend is a little bit different during the times where we have less incoming volume because the mix changed. So we do think that distorts that a little bit.\nJohn Sauerland: At the bodily injury severity even more generally speaking, as our inventory ages are reserving factors are such that we increase the expected cost of an injury claim, the older it gets. And we put those dollars into the current loss dollars each month, we're dividing by the incurred accounts for that month. So, to the extent new volume coming in is lower and we continue that inventory ageing on bodily injury and current severity trend is going to look higher.\nTricia Griffith: Right. If you look at the quarter for bodily injury, it was about 9% and through February was 5%. We know that in March fewer incoming which increased the age like Jon said, there were more attorney but less lawsuits. So we think with our average age increasing the encouraged severity would be better than February.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. So maybe I'll try else for a different angle, as miles driven or increase your number of trips is increasing again from the mid-March trough. Are you seeing speeding decreasing and maybe distracted driving decreasing?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we talked about the hard braking and the phone in hand. So we have seen that increase, about 10% to 15%. But we have not seen that result in greater claims costs.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then my follow up is on new business that you mentioned in the Q that you saw a significant drop off in new business in, even the direct channel and in the COVID environment. Does that surprise you? And would you expect that to maybe pick up as people -- maybe as the environment stabilizes?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I didn't surprise us. We didn't really know how deep the initial decrease would be. But we've already seen it pick up from pre-COVID and specifically in the direct channel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Mead with Anchor Capital Advisors.\nStephen Mead: What do you see in terms of post-COVID from the standpoint of distribution, either direct or through the agency channel? And do you see that this period is going to in a sense, hurt the agency in spite of distribution and what kinds of adjustments are you looking at?\nTricia Griffith: And so we are a big advocate of the agency challenge since half our business on the auto side more so on the commercial side, you're part of it, part of the decrease and then a little bit slower the increase in agency channel, just has to do with a lot of times people want to go in, sit knee to knee talk with their agents. On the small business, it's -- a lot of the society what's going on with COVID-19. But we're very supportive. And that's why we've been trying to find grants for the industry and then grants for individual agents that, that call us. So because we obviously have social distancing, our sales reps are making calls daily to our agents making sure they have what they need, we've responded to get some of them computers and printers and things they need to work out of their home. So I think, that they will try to get back to business as soon as the shelter in place are lifted in their areas. I can't tell you, if there'll be people that don't actually last through this. We certainly hope they do. And we're going to do everything we can to support that channel and all of our 35,000 independent agents.\nJohn Sauerland: On the direct side as we pointed out in the Q, advertising was up a lot for January, February, I believe 28%, down a bit in March. And Pat can maybe comment a bit more. We are a large advertiser on live sports. And obviously spend there dropped to virtually nil, overnight. And so that is part of the reason our advertising spend for marches are recorded less than 2% relative to previous March. That said, the desire to grow and the direct channel and we'll spend, what we call allowables and I think are continuing to find opportunities.\nPat Callahan: Yes. I would build on that and just say that in the direct side, specifically, we are constantly evolving our media mix and testing and measuring into what's efficient and effective driving demand. So while we did see that that [trough] [ph] appropriately so focused on other things in car insurance, We are shifting to some more over the top in streaming services that people spend more time at home, some more digital than necessarily the mass media and finding select programming that we see significant spikes in viewership that we want to have Progressive brand position well. Now, on the agency channel, I think everything that Tricia said is absolutely spot on. The other thing to recognize is that that agents for the most part are small businesses. And the disruption to small businesses can't be overestimated and we do expect that the agency channel will come back just as strong as it was previously. And I think some of the digital capabilities that Progressive has invested in to help agents, both service customers and in the case of our snapshot usage based insurance program control their costs or match their costs to their driving will potentially position us well, to benefit from that rebound in the agency channel over time.\nTricia Griffith: And a great part of Our CRM organization is that they take service calls on behalf of the agents. So even if they're at home, we're able to talk those agent customers through the same sort of situations as our direct customers.\nStephen Mead: And just shifting gears. Any change or what's your sort of view of the investment side of your portfolio in terms of asset allocation or your approach to the fixed income side of investment? I'd be curious what you're doing, if anything?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I'll let Jonathan Bauer, who is our the PCM, President talk a little bit more about this. So, we talked a lot about their ability to protect the balance sheet and to get a total return that is compared to our index group. So that has not changed. Our philosophy on investing hasn't changed. Jonathan's been able to take advantage of sort of what's been happening in the economy and I'll let him give you a little bit of detail. And I will say risk, it's slight any risks that we've added during this situation. Jon?\nJonathan Bauer: Yes. Thanks very much for the question. So, as Tricia mentioned, for us, the focus is always number one to protect the balance sheet, so that the operating business can grow as fast as it wants to grow. And then after that, to earn the best total return that we can, we were fortunate to come into the year with a very conservative portfolio. The group one measure that we use for our riskiest assets, which is things like stocks and high yield bonds was at its post crisis lows. So when this started to happen, in late February into March, we began to invest in things as you saw in 10-Q, high quality corporate bonds, the municipal bond market, which we do to tax changes in the corporate tax rate, have not very attractive over the last two or three years, as that market faced some outflows we're able to buy some very high quality municipal bonds and then sprinkled in some securitized products as well. So we decided to add within what we would label as high quality and the fixed income throughout the month of March, starting in late February. We think our position is still incredibly conservative in our portfolio, but we think that we got some great total return opportunities. And I think we stand in a really strong place as we head in through the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Stefano: Why don't you talk a little more about the operating expenses maybe we can put aside the advertising expenses, it feels like a pretty well covered. But are there just discretionary expenses in the business or levers that you can pull down at a time like this to maybe help support the expense ratio improvements that may come back next year or at least to offset some of the increases in allowance for doubtful expenses or other things like that to maybe neutralize the upside expense pressures, you might be seeing.\nTricia Griffith: I think we always have different levers. And I think you've seen in the past when things have happened, where we've gotten closer to our 96, we've done that we're really not in that position now because of the margins. And like we talked about, we have the expense for 28 points for the doubtful accounts. And we'll watch and see how that continues to impact us through April. We are always looking at expenses and how to do more with less, et cetera. This is an odd-time, but I think once we get through this and things are back to normal and claims frequencies back to normal we will continue with our expense management. A lot of this, we learned about how many people work from home. And so initially, before the COVID happened, we probably had maybe about 10,000 of our employees or 43,000 employees working from home now we have 95%. As we think about returning, there could be an advantage for real estate, because many of those people will be very efficient and effective working from home, it would be better for them. So those all the things like that we will look at. And when I talked about that, sort of that third tranche of how we think about the future, we have five different teams working out what we call reimagine. And one of those is based -- it really talks about expenses and people and the workforce. And so we will look at all these things that happen and then figure out how to come out on the better end. As an example, when I was -- when during the financial crisis, I was the President of Claims and we have same situation were the frequency had diminished during that timeframe. And that's when we started learning about being able to do things virtually that you didn't have to be sitting necessarily in every office and we really started to consolidate and have right file, right rep right time. I believe we will learn a lot from these to continue to be more efficient. We care about that immensely.\nPhilip Stefano: Interesting here is a bit of picking up the ride sharing business, have there been any interesting lessons that have come out of the decline of frequency broader, had the economics of the ride sharing business changed at all?\nTricia Griffith: I have to let the people that run the ride sharing companies talk about that. We continue to be very happy with our relationships. And as you saw -- we had decrease in net premium written over about over 110 million on the commercial side. That wasn't surprising because we look at miles driven during a given policy period, and then we kind of trued that up with extra miles. And it's just clear right now, in fact those companies are saying you shouldn't necessarily drive. So I think, we'll watch and see if that comes back. And it really all depends, I think on how quickly once the shelter in place orders are lifted and people feel comfortable and more importantly vaccine. So I can't predict the future. But I'm not surprised that the decreases based on the restrictions in the States.\nJulia Hornack: Great. So Jake, we'll go ahead and take our next question from Mike Zaremski.\nOperator: Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Zaremski: My question and if I missed this, just please tell me, was on telematics, are you seeing any changes in adoption rates. And also does your telematics data give you any kind of potential competitive advantages with filings as we kind of come out of this, in certain states that might allow you to take in telematics data to kind of be more precise or agile in your filings in the future? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Pat, you can weigh in on this and John B even on your with your smart haul. We've seen the adoption, I think people are more willing to adopt UBI because they realize they may be driving less and that would be a good program for them. So we're hoping that continues, because we believe this is a really very powerful variable. There are some states that we are not able to use it, but those it's only a few. So we'll continue to have usage based insurance and we will continue to learn from it. So we're not sitting still and saying, we're going to stop at, UBI 2.0. We're going to continue to evolve that as we do everything. On the commercial side, it has been great like John Barbagallo said, we're able to understand that a third of our truckers are driving more summer driving number able to work with them to kind of get through this. And we're able to help support those truckers, and give them the discounts they deserve with that program or continue to evolve that program as well with something we call PROVIEW. That will be rolling out in this quarter. So we were very bullish on telematics across our entire company on both the private passenger auto and commercial side. So do you have anything to add, Pat?\nPat Callahan: Sure. On the personal line side, exactly, as you mentioned that we have a lot of monitoring that's in place and we've seen some survey data that indicates that people are now more open to usage based insurance, so that potentially will drive adoption and help primarily in the agency channel where we still lag behind our direct channel adoption. But beyond that, we've also seen a higher take rate within our quoting funnel. So not surprising that people are looking to think a little more about getting a benefit from driving less and if they are thinking and looking forward to working from home for an extended period of time, they may think of Progressive as a leader and usage-based insurance as a good choice for them as they think about their future insurance needs. Now, from the state level filing perspective, one of the toughest decisions we have to make is with the uncertainty how we're pricing policies on a going forward basis. And I think Tricia highlighted some of the detail level data that we have. Our snapshot program gives us hundreds of thousands of daily monitored drivers across the country. And what that gives us at the state and DMA level is visibility into not only how is the recovery actually taking place, but then correlating those miles travelled with our actual claims data. And that's a really important thing to understand because the ramp down of miles was so quick that we saw them highly correlated when they ramped down, what we need to watch is on the recovery side, does the time a day and day a week of those vehicle miles travelled correlate with higher frequency events, so that we can price policies accurately going forward.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Pat. And Jon will you talk a little bit about smart haul and?\nJohn Barbagallo: So Mike, I would say on the commercial side, we're still fairly early in the adoption phase of both of our telematics products, smart hauls been out there longer. It has been very well received and had been doing very well. I can't at this point say has the adoption rate increase due to COVID. But I think one of the things we're learning with this pandemic is, truckers are affected very differently by what's happening. And this actually gives us the ability to kind of proactively have a conversation with them about making use of space adjustments their rate. We think that's something that has the marketing power beyond just what we're going through right now. So excited about that. Snapshot PROVIEW very early in the adoption phase that's more than just telematics base pricing and brings with it a host of additional services. We're pleased with how that's going as well. Of course, overall demand has dropped, as I mentioned earlier, but again, nothing there to suggest it would interfere with the adoption on that program. But, again, I couldn't tell you it's going to accelerate at this point in time, but we'll be curious to see how that plays out.\nJulia Hornack: That would appear to have been our final question, actually. So that concludes our event. Jake, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing script.\nOperator: Thank you, ma'am. That concludes the Progressive Corporation's first quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's Web site for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning. Before we open up for your Q&A, I'd like to make just a few remarks of how Progressive has responded to COVID-19 because I'm extraordinarily proud of my team and the nearly 43,000 people that make Progressive incredible company and culture that we all enjoy. As you know, with our incredible growth over the past several years, I've had the opportunity to welcome thousands of new people into progressive. I take an hour to meet with new hires and talk about our core values in our culture. I sometimes struggle describing our special culture because it is somewhat indescribable. So I usually say that it becomes crystal clear when something really great happens or when there is a crisis. This unprecedented situation has allowed all of our Progressive family to visibly live our core values and completely understand why this is such a unique place. The actions we've taken for both our employees and customers have absolutely created and reinforced their loyalty to Progressive. Let me walk you through a few specifics. We immediately determined the needs of each of our constituents and started to develop plans forming teams to address each party. We've named the program, the Apron Relief Program, a nod to our brand icon it symbolizes protection and strength. Let me start with our employee base. We knew we needed to get the majority of our employees home to be able to work and take care of our customers. We immediately put into play our business continuity plan to protect our people. Currently, 95% of our workforce is working from home and for the employees that need to continue to come into the office, we've adjusted the workspaces to increase social distances, and we've intensified our cleaning measures. We also knew that even though every Progressive employee has a job and many of them have spouses and significant others that aren't as fortunate. In order to help our employees to have financial confidence, we paid our non-equity employees a portion of their annual gain share bonus in April. We also have created and committed $2 million to the Progressive employee relief fund to assist our employees experiencing hardships. Our employees have really appreciated the communication from every level of leaders at Progressive. I send a weekly video from my home and have literally received thousands of notes from our employees. I'll share one that will give you a sense of the sentiments. In a time of uncertainty, I want to let you know your videos in Progressive had been so encouraging and uplifting. I've never been prouder to be part of our Progressive family. I bleed blue and orange, but all that we are doing during this most difficult time to help each other and others is inspiring. Thank you for taking the time to be so honest and for opening your home and family to all of us. It's refreshing seeing you and your family's experiences are similar to ours. I love your journey through the years at Progressive and how approachable and friendly, I've always been. I know we try to be not what you expect an insurance company for our customers. But I'm very grateful and proud that is also for our employees. And I received so many of those. The customers that were privileged to serve need us now more than ever. We are providing premium credits of 20% to personal auto policies in force at the end of April and May, which amount to approximately $1 billion. In addition, we temporarily suspended cancellations and non-renewals on personal and commercial lines policy, paused collection activities and have deferred some deductibles. We also provided delivering meals for our 400 trucking customers, first responders and health care providers. I'll share one of the many comments we received from the first responder. I'm so impressed with Progressive and what they are doing about the COVID situation. You guys are really helping our customers and even providing food to our table. Thank you. These kinds of things make you want to stay with the company forever. For our communities we've given $8 million of donations to charities focused on hunger, health and homelessness. I recently received a call from Claire, the CEO of Feeding America, and she was so thankful that we were providing meals to so many who need them now more than ever. I also recently received a letter from Gail the CEO of the American Red Cross. I'll read a short excerpt. I wanted to reach out to you with a personal note to express my most sincere appreciation for the Progressive Insurance Foundation's recent and truly impactful gift to the Red Cross and powering the continued delivery of our life saving mission nationwide and then the Coronavirus outbreak. As our humanitarian organization continues to adapt to meet the new challenges presented by this pandemic, your generosity ensures that Red Cross is there to provide vital blood and disaster relief services to people around the U.S. who rely on us when they win help can't wait. We also care immensely about our partners and helping them get through this trying time. For our body shops and independent agent partners, it's about loyalty, but it's also about minimizing the disruption of our supply chain as we get on the other side of this crisis. For more than 35,000 independent agents, we are partnering with agent associations to provide over $2.5 million in grants to help agents address new challenges presented by the virus, and we're also administering internal fund to provide additional targeted relief to our agents. Additionally, we've made over $40 million available to agents by advancing performance bonus payments to more than 4500 of our agents. While the opt-in period is still open on today, we've had over 1600 agents opt-in for a total of $20 million. In addition, we sent $1,000 to each of our network body shops to use as a soft pad. We saw this is another opportunity to help when they needed it most and show them how much we value them. One shop owner called in tears to tell us how much that was appreciated. Lastly, we aren't sitting still and have our eyes focused on the future. In fact, we formulated three distinct scopes of work outlined under constructs we call resolve, return and reimagine. Resolve, first and foremost, we are addressing the immediate challenges COVID-19 presents to our workforce, customers, agents, communities and other stakeholders. Return, next, we are creating detailed plans to return business back to scale quickly as the virus evolves, lasting impact are more understood and effects become clearer. Reimagine, lastly, we have formed several teams under this category and the goal is to understand how the environment may shift and reimagine the next normal and how we can position ourselves to flourish. All of this to say our shareholders should feel very confident that we've got this covered for the short, medium and long-term. Our resilience is shining brighter than ever and we will come out of this stronger that I'm confident in. Thank you and now we'll take the first question. I'm going to give Jake just a moment to allow additional callers into the question queue. But so I'll get started with the first question, which is can you talk about the current shifts in automotive automobile usage and potential shifts in automobile usage as the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and the resulting impact to Progressive? Well, absolutely, let me start with our usage based insurance data because it is continues to evolve as the shelter and place orders are lifted. So we saw abrupt declines in miles driven in mid-March. And by the end of the month and the daily driving for vehicle miles travelled was 40% lower than pre-COVID baselines. And then, in the first few days of May, we started to see some broad based increase in driving and I'll give you a little bit more on that. So last week, and we actually saw driving only down 14% countrywide versus pre-COVID. Now that changes and even up to this Monday we saw around 20%, 25%. So we are definitely seeing in states where the shelter in place has lifted we're seeing driving continue to be to increase and we're really following it on a daily basis. So I would say the level of data I'd normally don't show this level of data, but we're really literally watching it state by state and day by day to understand driving behavior. The reductions we're seeing are almost entirely due to changes in number of trips and not the length of trips. And I think, overall, I can't tell you what will happen in the future because these times are so uncertain. But the fact that we have this knowledge of the driving behavior, I think has been really important for us, as we understand sort of long-term trends. Great. Thanks for that date. Jake, can we please go to the first question in the queue, please? Well, it's hard to give a certain percentage Michael, but we will care deeply to continue to care about costs because, this is a -- it's a competitive environment. That has always been one of our four pillars when we talk about our strategy of becoming consumers' number one choice, so we'll continue to care about cost. And from a media perspective, we will spend media when we think it's efficient. This has been sort of a strange time because a lot of our media spend has -- is normally in live sports, et cetera. So obviously, in March, it went down a little bit because of that. But from an efficiency perspective, we are constantly thinking of ways to take unnecessary costs out of the system, to be able to have competitive prices for our customers. Can't tell you the exact amount but we talked about it all the time on my team. I wish I had that crystal ball. I think all the good companies are thinking about right now, getting consumers back, some of the money from the premiums because of the reduction in driving. Again, we're seeing that reduction go to less levels and we saw initially in March so we will price it. And one of the reasons that we did credits was because the fact that, we care a lot about segmentation and making sure that a lot of variables that we use, were price try and so we didn't want to kind of mess up that and I think all the good companies will do that and we will be competitive. And we will think about all the things that are important in terms of continued segmentation. So even during this time, whether it's on the personal line side or the commercial line side, we have been focused on continuing with our product models understanding right to risk, understanding our cost structure, making sure our brand has evolved and all those things together, I believe I can only speak on behalf of Progressive. I think we will come out of this stronger and be able to continue to capture share as we've had in the last 3, 4 years. Yes. So a lot of that is from the leniency and then we through March 15, we didn't cancel for non-pay. So, that we will expect that to increase, we're not going to share the exact amount. But here's what we're really trying to do. I think this is an important piece, Mike. In John Murphy's CRM organization, they're really working closely to personalize it with each customer. And we're trying to make sure that if they couldn't pay for a certain period of time, how do we get them back on track, we want people to be legal, we want people to have insurance, we want to be really flexible with each and every customer that happens to. So we have those 200,000 customers, that -- the payments will start to come due, we'll work with them to try to design coverage that they're able to stay, insurance insured with Progressive. And John Murphy's team is working literally many, many hours in many days, it's just to think about this in his team. And in fact, the CRM organization has been quite busy because we're doing a lot of personalization, a lot of consultation with our customers at this time, when they really need to understand how they can stay legal. And we actually have a couple hundred people from our claims organization who had worked in CRM at one point moving over to be able to counsel those customers. So retention is going to be as important as ever, we don't know how many people we will lose or that won't have insurance for a while. There's so many different variables in terms of what is happening in our customers lives, but our goal is to keep as many as we can and we are going to do that as much we can. And put so much work into that to make sure that our retention stays the same. May 20. Yes, I mean, we watched the hardships kind of unfold. And so, I mean, we care a lot about that. I have to tell you a story that just came to me yesterday. And this is back to my culture comment. Mike, so woman from CRM was talking to one of our customers that couldn't pay for May and we're talking -- she was talking through leniency and our CRM rep and I don't always want this to happen, but I think this is a beautiful story. Our CRM rep paid a premium for May out of her own pocket, which to me is like, that's an incredible tribute to our culture and having somebody listening to a customer and doing the right thing. Now, of course, I don't want that to happen all the time. It's an extraordinary example. I think is a good example of our culture. And we're going to do whatever we can to make sure that we understand the hardships going forward. And the most important thing is to make sure that people stay legal and have insurance and we hope it's a Progressive. Well, we disclosed it publicly because it was correlated with our dividend policies. So we've had it internally forever when we change the dividend policy to have that reflected in our gains share score is a piece of the formula. We shared publicly. So we started not doing that when we changed the dividend policy last year. So what we did this year was we looked at the gain share for the quarter, we took in conservative estimates. So we didn't go to the full number that we thought it would be on basically to make sure that we gave the employees that needed most some of their bonus that we believe, is not at risk. Of course, again, we don't know what'll happen at the end of the year, lots of things can happen, but we won't share the gains share publicly going forward, especially since we have monthly earnings release. And we've also even gotten more disclosures on that in terms of caps and in our approach to how we look at caps on a monthly basis. Those are good questions, Elyse. So we have seen I'll have Pat Callahan, add in a little bit on this and John Barbagallo, if he want too as well because it's a little bit different during depending on the business marketing tier in commercial, but we have seen some uptick in shopping. Usually during disruptive times, you'll start to see that. Again, there's so many variables going on. So we know that a cohort of people in America have gotten some portion of their tax refund or their tax benefits from COVID. We've always seen shopping in times like this and we're watching it closely on the private passenger auto side. And in commercial, it's very different, if you're talking about business auto versus trucking, and I will have John Barbagallo talk a little bit about that. But the uptick hasn't been extraordinary, but we are seeing it, so we're taking every day to point to understand how during this disruptive time, we can have competitive prices. Pat, you want to add in some more detail on that. John, you want to? And for your question on sort of policy credits in our customer accounts, obviously, we have those April and May and we're always assessing, I went through the UBI data, we're assessing that more now on a state-by-state basis because of the different shelter in place orders and what will happen. And so going forward, I think that'll -- it'll be key for us to do what we do best in terms of by state, by channel, by product to understand the differences that have happened from COVID-19 and then react to those. It's hard to say what will happen from an industry perspective, because I think different companies handle it differently. But we'll go back to -- I'm really trying to understand it on a more granular level, depending on the state, the channel the product. That bounced back started about mid-April, mid to late April started the bounce back to about 25%. And right now, we think we're between 20 and 25. That 14% was specifically just to kind of show you like the detail that we look at for a weekend. So take Monday's data of this past Monday that was 21%. So we're right around that point. And again, it varies wildly depending on the states in terms of their restrictions. So if you look at a New York, it's very different than a Georgia. And so that's really how we're looking at it. The New York Times puts out sort of what's happening with restrictions being lifted. And we look at that and it seems to mirror some of the things we've seen. Of course, we don't have all the data that's in there, but we believe that's a correlation. So we think this next, two weeks, three weeks will be really interesting because so many states are starting to live, starting to open up and of course, depending on what happens with cases and testing that may change but I mean, just anecdotally, I was talking to Dan Mascaro, our Chief Legal Officer on Monday, and he went to hike in the metro parks in Cleveland. And he said it was so crowded. So you start to see this rare sunshine in Cleveland and people get out and they start to drive. And like Mike Johnson, we have a lot of theories that we play around with on my team to think about, okay, this summer, will people -- will you drive to grandma's house or to wherever versus fly? Could there be an increase in those longer trips? And of course, that has different frequency as well. So yes, I would say anywhere between right now we're seeing 20 to 25, but we started to see that mid-April. Not sure if I understand your question. John, you wan to take that? Yes. Sorry about that Meyer. I wasn't sure about it. But, yes, I think we'll continue to use that. And I think it's also only one variable that we use when we look at the sort of holistic rates to risk. But again, during these times, there's going to be a lot of data that will skew things that we'll have to kind of understand as we think about pricing and risks going forward. I've seen a lot of data around speeds and anecdotally driving here today, there was a lot of people that were going really fast because there weren't very many on the highway. So I kind of made a note of that. What we've observed is, so we looked at hard brakes for 100 miles driven and the percentage of trips with time with their phone in their hand, we've seen that increase about 10% to 15% after the post-COVID-19. So it could suggest that the miles are riskier. We are not seeing that in the claims data yet. So we're going to be watching that closely. Yes. I think you'd refer to as our Bob product Atlas service, yes, behind it. Yes. Well, so for Bob products, we have less than 200 of those policies that have business interruption insurance, and we have an exclusion for damages caused by virus or bacteria in those. We use ISO verbiage. So we feel like our risk is very, very low, less than 200 policies and we have an exclusion. I do want to say as long as we're talking about this, as a leader in the U.S., P&C marketplace, we're very actively involved in ensuring the COVID pandemic doesn't result in legislative or regulatory actions that permanently damage the voluntary insurance market and slow our nation's economic recovery. The U.S. markets heavily regulated and we want to ensure carriers provide essential products that comply with the applicable regulations. So when they're developing and filing these program, the voluntary insurance market relies heavily, we rely heavily on contracts sanctity, and that's a really important piece that we believe in. And we have to ensure that so that we have adequate prices for all included exposures. So when you think about the economic damage that is, is tragic for small business, we don't believe that fabricating coverage that doesn't exist on insurance policies is the right solution for this problem. That said, we have little exposure if any but as an industry, we feel very passionate about the fact of contract sanctity. Yes. I don't know if I have a specific answer to that. Normally, when its part of the mortgage, it's less likely to not be paid because it has to be part of that and so it's just a pass-through. Well, I'd have to watch it. I know we have a lot of history. But no history is like this. And so we look back and times like -- during the financial crisis, et cetera. And so we'll just have to follow the trends and then we're after them. Yes. The severity has been a little bit different for us. First of all, we report encouraged trends instead of paid trends. So for frequency, the incurred is more responsive and for severity both incurred and paid are more impacted by sudden changes in data. And so that may not be a true reflection of our trends. So, my opinion on severity right now, I can't necessarily tell, partly because the incurred counts distort the severity trends. Let me give you an example. So our property damage for the quarter was about 14% on severity trends. We think about 9 points to that, how to deal with trends that we've been seeing in the past, total loss repairables. What we think of the other 5% is really applied to supplement dollars that came in March from prior months, subrogation dollars from other companies from prior months. And when you apply those to March, they increase the encouraged severity. So we think that trend is a little bit different during the times where we have less incoming volume because the mix changed. So we do think that distorts that a little bit. Right. If you look at the quarter for bodily injury, it was about 9% and through February was 5%. We know that in March fewer incoming which increased the age like Jon said, there were more attorney but less lawsuits. So we think with our average age increasing the encouraged severity would be better than February. Well, we talked about the hard braking and the phone in hand. So we have seen that increase, about 10% to 15%. But we have not seen that result in greater claims costs. Yes. I didn't surprise us. We didn't really know how deep the initial decrease would be. But we've already seen it pick up from pre-COVID and specifically in the direct channel. And so we are a big advocate of the agency challenge since half our business on the auto side more so on the commercial side, you're part of it, part of the decrease and then a little bit slower the increase in agency channel, just has to do with a lot of times people want to go in, sit knee to knee talk with their agents. On the small business, it's -- a lot of the society what's going on with COVID-19. But we're very supportive. And that's why we've been trying to find grants for the industry and then grants for individual agents that, that call us. So because we obviously have social distancing, our sales reps are making calls daily to our agents making sure they have what they need, we've responded to get some of them computers and printers and things they need to work out of their home. So I think, that they will try to get back to business as soon as the shelter in place are lifted in their areas. I can't tell you, if there'll be people that don't actually last through this. We certainly hope they do. And we're going to do everything we can to support that channel and all of our 35,000 independent agents. And a great part of Our CRM organization is that they take service calls on behalf of the agents. So even if they're at home, we're able to talk those agent customers through the same sort of situations as our direct customers. Yes, I'll let Jonathan Bauer, who is our the PCM, President talk a little bit more about this. So, we talked a lot about their ability to protect the balance sheet and to get a total return that is compared to our index group. So that has not changed. Our philosophy on investing hasn't changed. Jonathan's been able to take advantage of sort of what's been happening in the economy and I'll let him give you a little bit of detail. And I will say risk, it's slight any risks that we've added during this situation. Jon? I think we always have different levers. And I think you've seen in the past when things have happened, where we've gotten closer to our 96, we've done that we're really not in that position now because of the margins. And like we talked about, we have the expense for 28 points for the doubtful accounts. And we'll watch and see how that continues to impact us through April. We are always looking at expenses and how to do more with less, et cetera. This is an odd-time, but I think once we get through this and things are back to normal and claims frequencies back to normal we will continue with our expense management. A lot of this, we learned about how many people work from home. And so initially, before the COVID happened, we probably had maybe about 10,000 of our employees or 43,000 employees working from home now we have 95%. As we think about returning, there could be an advantage for real estate, because many of those people will be very efficient and effective working from home, it would be better for them. So those all the things like that we will look at. And when I talked about that, sort of that third tranche of how we think about the future, we have five different teams working out what we call reimagine. And one of those is based -- it really talks about expenses and people and the workforce. And so we will look at all these things that happen and then figure out how to come out on the better end. As an example, when I was -- when during the financial crisis, I was the President of Claims and we have same situation were the frequency had diminished during that timeframe. And that's when we started learning about being able to do things virtually that you didn't have to be sitting necessarily in every office and we really started to consolidate and have right file, right rep right time. I believe we will learn a lot from these to continue to be more efficient. We care about that immensely. I have to let the people that run the ride sharing companies talk about that. We continue to be very happy with our relationships. And as you saw -- we had decrease in net premium written over about over 110 million on the commercial side. That wasn't surprising because we look at miles driven during a given policy period, and then we kind of trued that up with extra miles. And it's just clear right now, in fact those companies are saying you shouldn't necessarily drive. So I think, we'll watch and see if that comes back. And it really all depends, I think on how quickly once the shelter in place orders are lifted and people feel comfortable and more importantly vaccine. So I can't predict the future. But I'm not surprised that the decreases based on the restrictions in the States. Pat, you can weigh in on this and John B even on your with your smart haul. We've seen the adoption, I think people are more willing to adopt UBI because they realize they may be driving less and that would be a good program for them. So we're hoping that continues, because we believe this is a really very powerful variable. There are some states that we are not able to use it, but those it's only a few. So we'll continue to have usage based insurance and we will continue to learn from it. So we're not sitting still and saying, we're going to stop at, UBI 2.0. We're going to continue to evolve that as we do everything. On the commercial side, it has been great like John Barbagallo said, we're able to understand that a third of our truckers are driving more summer driving number able to work with them to kind of get through this. And we're able to help support those truckers, and give them the discounts they deserve with that program or continue to evolve that program as well with something we call PROVIEW. That will be rolling out in this quarter. So we were very bullish on telematics across our entire company on both the private passenger auto and commercial side. So do you have anything to add, Pat? Thanks, Pat. And Jon will you talk a little bit about smart haul and?"

            "name": "John Barbagallo",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Elyse on the small business side, the demand function is pretty well correlated with what's going on in the economy. So we saw very definite demand shocks. And similar to personal auto, we are starting to see that come back nicely. We're still on a year-over-year basis below where we'd expect to be, especially given what is normally a peak season, this is somewhat seasonal business, but we are seeing recovery. The other thing is, and Tricia alluded to this, different businesses were affected very differently by COVID. So, I'll give one example in our truck where we have good telematics data through our smart haul program. About a third of our truckers actually saw an increase in miles driven. And then they tend to be kind of drive freight agriculture, livestock calling, but about 7%, 8% of them completely shut down. So, if you're an auto hauler, you're not real busy right now. And, so we monitored kind of not only kind of on a state level, on a BMT level, but we even go down to kind of industry class codes. And we see things very differently. And they will respond to that, the data continue to emerge. So Mike, I would say on the commercial side, we're still fairly early in the adoption phase of both of our telematics products, smart hauls been out there longer. It has been very well received and had been doing very well. I can't at this point say has the adoption rate increase due to COVID. But I think one of the things we're learning with this pandemic is, truckers are affected very differently by what's happening. And this actually gives us the ability to kind of proactively have a conversation with them about making use of space adjustments their rate. We think that's something that has the marketing power beyond just what we're going through right now. So excited about that. Snapshot PROVIEW very early in the adoption phase that's more than just telematics base pricing and brings with it a host of additional services. We're pleased with how that's going as well. Of course, overall demand has dropped, as I mentioned earlier, but again, nothing there to suggest it would interfere with the adoption on that program. But, again, I couldn't tell you it's going to accelerate at this point in time, but we'll be curious to see how that plays out."

            "name": "Jonathan Bauer",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks very much for the question. So, as Tricia mentioned, for us, the focus is always number one to protect the balance sheet, so that the operating business can grow as fast as it wants to grow. And then after that, to earn the best total return that we can, we were fortunate to come into the year with a very conservative portfolio. The group one measure that we use for our riskiest assets, which is things like stocks and high yield bonds was at its post crisis lows. So when this started to happen, in late February into March, we began to invest in things as you saw in 10-Q, high quality corporate bonds, the municipal bond market, which we do to tax changes in the corporate tax rate, have not very attractive over the last two or three years, as that market faced some outflows we're able to buy some very high quality municipal bonds and then sprinkled in some securitized products as well. So we decided to add within what we would label as high quality and the fixed income throughout the month of March, starting in late February. We think our position is still incredibly conservative in our portfolio, but we think that we got some great total return opportunities. And I think we stand in a really strong place as we head in through the second quarter."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "Sure. We definitely seen a rebound from the immediate lows during the shutdown or the shelter in place. We have seen a different recovery by channel as well, where we've seen a faster recovery on the direct side of the business than we have an agency because we expected agents offices are still somewhat disrupted. And, we do see just a lower recovery from our agency channel. Yes. I would build on that and just say that in the direct side, specifically, we are constantly evolving our media mix and testing and measuring into what's efficient and effective driving demand. So while we did see that that [trough] [ph] appropriately so focused on other things in car insurance, We are shifting to some more over the top in streaming services that people spend more time at home, some more digital than necessarily the mass media and finding select programming that we see significant spikes in viewership that we want to have Progressive brand position well. Now, on the agency channel, I think everything that Tricia said is absolutely spot on. The other thing to recognize is that that agents for the most part are small businesses. And the disruption to small businesses can't be overestimated and we do expect that the agency channel will come back just as strong as it was previously. And I think some of the digital capabilities that Progressive has invested in to help agents, both service customers and in the case of our snapshot usage based insurance program control their costs or match their costs to their driving will potentially position us well, to benefit from that rebound in the agency channel over time. Sure. On the personal line side, exactly, as you mentioned that we have a lot of monitoring that's in place and we've seen some survey data that indicates that people are now more open to usage based insurance, so that potentially will drive adoption and help primarily in the agency channel where we still lag behind our direct channel adoption. But beyond that, we've also seen a higher take rate within our quoting funnel. So not surprising that people are looking to think a little more about getting a benefit from driving less and if they are thinking and looking forward to working from home for an extended period of time, they may think of Progressive as a leader and usage-based insurance as a good choice for them as they think about their future insurance needs. Now, from the state level filing perspective, one of the toughest decisions we have to make is with the uncertainty how we're pricing policies on a going forward basis. And I think Tricia highlighted some of the detail level data that we have. Our snapshot program gives us hundreds of thousands of daily monitored drivers across the country. And what that gives us at the state and DMA level is visibility into not only how is the recovery actually taking place, but then correlating those miles travelled with our actual claims data. And that's a really important thing to understand because the ramp down of miles was so quick that we saw them highly correlated when they ramped down, what we need to watch is on the recovery side, does the time a day and day a week of those vehicle miles travelled correlate with higher frequency events, so that we can price policies accurately going forward."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "I will just add to that, obviously, everyone is wondering how fast this company is back? Does it come back to the same level of miles travelled as pre-COVID, and we're obviously trying to assess that as well. We believe there may be some trends around lower usage of public transportation over the longer term. They're also think there must be some substitution effect from air travel to vehicle travels for longer trips. And we'll be watching this carefully over time. And if we continue to see opportunities to give credits to our customers, we'll do that. But we are going to take it on a sort of a month by month and a geographically specific basis. Obviously, our product managers at Progressive are a huge competitive advantage for us, while we've taken a broad swath to date. We think the right path forward is likely a more surgical approach to any further credits. Mike, I will just add. Clearly the 200,000 is through the end of March and leniency goes through May 15. So we won't cancel anyone for non-payment or renew them through May 15. Starting May 15, customers will be getting bills that will be for the balance outstanding for the period in which we planned our leniency as well as the upcoming months. So, we will be working very hard as Tricia mentioned, our customer relationship management organization to make sure we keep those customers. If you're trying to estimate what bad debt write-offs were being through April through May that's a fair thing to do for sure. We're not providing numbers in terms of additional people that we are providing leniency to at this point, but it's safe to assume that it is more than 200,000 as of end of March. And it will be -- a difficult challenge, frankly, to estimate what portion of that we won't collect. This is unprecedented. Of course, we normally have bad debt expense routines, unexposed premium, those really don't apply in this case, it's very different situation. So we will be making some estimates. And the good news is, due to our monthly releases, you will have clarity around that for April and just a couple -- I think that I can try. If I'm off-base what are you trying to get to please redirect. So we do perhaps look at payment patterns on current and incoming customers as a portion of a set of data that we look at when we are underwriting both new business as well as renewals. Is that the direction you're taking the question? Yes. So that's a great question. And similarly with our snapshot data patterns have changed dramatically relative to fairly normal and very predictable datasets over time. So, yes, that will be a challenge for us. We are making exceptions in our underwriting today around new businesses, especially where we can pull data sets from common sources that the industry contributes to look at previous insurance ownership patterns. And, yes, that's been disrupted. And in the near term, I think it's fair to say, there will be a period where we probably have to exclude over the longer term run. I think the snapshot or vehicle usage based data will fall into the same camp. So it's really difficult to read right now. But you're right that is a underwriting variable that we have used and I would say in the interim, we are redirecting a bit. But in the long-term, we think we will continue to use that -- the underwriting we've done we think, has been a huge benefit to us in terms of avoiding new business that we probably are going to price accurately. Yes. It's generally paid up front, in the mortgage. So while, the forbearance might postpone payments to the bank, generally speaking, the insurance hasn't paid upfront in that situation. While the premium again is generally speaking, paid upfront, so then the payment from the customer to the bank, the bank would be in that case, short on the money because the bank is generally recorded the entire insurance premium to us at the inception of that policy. Yes. They would have collected via escrow and put a year of homeowners insurance aside exactly for these types of either late payments or forbearance, to escrow directly. At the bodily injury severity even more generally speaking, as our inventory ages are reserving factors are such that we increase the expected cost of an injury claim, the older it gets. And we put those dollars into the current loss dollars each month, we're dividing by the incurred accounts for that month. So, to the extent new volume coming in is lower and we continue that inventory ageing on bodily injury and current severity trend is going to look higher. On the direct side as we pointed out in the Q, advertising was up a lot for January, February, I believe 28%, down a bit in March. And Pat can maybe comment a bit more. We are a large advertiser on live sports. And obviously spend there dropped to virtually nil, overnight. And so that is part of the reason our advertising spend for marches are recorded less than 2% relative to previous March. That said, the desire to grow and the direct channel and we'll spend, what we call allowables and I think are continuing to find opportunities."

I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be moderator for today\u2019s event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q in the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. This quarter, we will have a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations sections of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, 2021 was a year like no other. We were forced to confront the new normal imposed on us by the pandemic. We faced business challenges unlike those we have ever previously seen, all while continuing to serve our customers at the level they have come to expect from Progressive. Our people are flexible. They can see the challenges coming and react appropriately to ensure we meet our business objectives. Our ability to respond like this is supported by our corporate culture, which is built on our four cornerstones: who we are which is based on our five core values; why we are here, which is our purpose; where we are headed, which is our vision; and how we will get there, which is our strategy. This construct guides us so we are all headed in the same direction regardless of the bumps in the road. To achieve our vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto home and other insurance, we need to execute on our four strategic pillars. In our quarter two call, I spoke in detail about our pillars and their importance to our business and I continued that discussion in my annual letter to shareholders. While each pillar is equally important to support our strategy, today, we are going to focus on a single pillar, competitive pricing. Competitive pricing does not mean having the lowest rate all the time, although we strive to do that as much as possible. Rather, it means having the correct rate to match the risk we are trying to ensure, while at the same time, delivering more value to the customer. We believe that if we could outsegment our competition, settle claims accurately and manage expenses appropriately, providing attractive rates to our customers will come naturally. It\u2019s no secret that the insurance industry is going through a period of immense change brought on by catastrophic weather events and macroeconomic headwinds. Our business is no exception. The changes in Personal Lines results, which is our largest line of business, were especially pronounced. Personal Lines results continued to benefit in the first quarter of the year by lower frequency brought on by the pandemic. However, the last three quarters delivered challenges. Frequency started to rise, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in frequency did not surprise us as people started driving more, what was a bit of surprise were the increases in severity, especially the cost to repair and replace vehicles. It was these rising trends that forced us to increase rates. Once we realize these developments were not temporary, our product managers acted quickly, and in the second quarter, started taking Personal Auto rate increases, which were in advance of many in the industry. We have continued to increase rates through the fourth quarter with a total of 8% taken in calendar year 2021. In addition to rate changes, we also had to make some difficult decisions to reduce expenses and increase underwriting scrutiny to hit our profitability goal of a 96 combined ratio, which is the expected impact of reducing growth. While these decisions are tough to make and the short-term results can be difficult to acknowledge, we believe we have built a better mousetrap. History has shown that following times of industry disruption, we have grown our Personal Lines business faster than our competitors with better profitability. Further, it has been after times like this that we have made some of our greatest strides to achieving our vision. Today, we will spend some time talking about the mousetrap that allows us to react faster and we believe more accurately than the industry as a whole. Our first topic today will be on the science of Personal Auto pricing. We will discuss how we take massive amounts of incoming data and apply tools to make risk-based decisions and provide an accurate view of rate adequacy. John Curtiss, our National Product Development Leader, will be presenting this topic. John currently leads our Personal Auto product R&D and pricing groups and has held numerous roles throughout his 19-year career with Progressive. Next, on the agenda is Kanik Varma, who will demonstrate the real-world execution of the science used by our product managers. Kanik has been with Progressive for over 20 years and was recently appointed as the General Manager of the West region. Kanik currently leads a team of about 12 product managers and draws on many years of direct product management experience to lead the team. Kanik will wrap up the presentation by talking about Progressive\u2019s deployment capabilities. Following the presentations, we will of course have our Q&A session. Again, thank you for joining this morning. I will now hand it over to John Curtiss. John?\nJohn Curtiss: Thanks, Tricia. Today, Kanik and I will give an update on the rate-making process in our Personal Auto business. We have structured our discussion in a Q&A format based upon common questions we receive from our investors. There are many facets to managing rate level in our Personal Auto business. And today, we are going to focus on two key aspects. First, we will share how we determine our rate need to support our operational goal to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. This can broadly be categorized into two areas: segment level and aggregate level. Segment level pricing is largely the responsibility of our product R&D group. While very important, we are not going to discuss this in detail today. You might remember that Pat Callahan and Sanjay Vyas discussed our approach to product segmentation back in our third quarter 2018 Investor Relations call. Today, we are going to focus on aggregate rate level, ensuring we are collecting enough premium in total to cover our expected future loss costs and expenses to achieve our 96 combined ratio goal. We will provide an overview on two key aspects of how we do this. The first topic that I will cover is the role of our auto pricing team who is responsible for the pricing indication process and providing product managers with an accurate estimate of rate need to ensure they hit rate revision profit targets. The second topic that Kanik will cover is how our product managers leverage these pricing indications, their broader toolkit, and local knowledge and expertise to set the pricing strategy for their respective states to ensure they hit not only rate revision targets, but also our calendar year goals. We will close the presentation with an overview of our deployment capabilities. In our Personal Auto business, it is very common for us to do hundreds of rate revisions per year, which involves many groups at Progressive. This is an area we have invested significantly in over the years to ensure we have industry-leading speed to market and the agility to adapt our resources to meet the dynamic needs of the marketplace. So, let\u2019s start with the first topic on how pricing and product management work together to determine our aggregate rate need. Before I go into details on our pricing tools, I will introduce six key concepts that we will be covering today. The first is compliance. Our product and rates need to comply with all state regulations, which can vary in each jurisdiction and often include limitations in our ability to use specific variables to rate policies. The second is that we price to cost. Our primary goal is to match the rate we charge with the expected cost to ensure our customers. To determine our aggregate rate need, we need to consider loss and loss adjustment expenses, operating and acquisition costs and our profit load. Third, insurance pricing is prospective. Insurance is unique as we do not know our cost of goods sold when we write a policy. As a result, we need to estimate future losses and expenses and ensure we charge enough premium to cover these and earn our profit load. Fourth, our rates need to comply with actuarial standards. The three primary considerations are to ensure rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And for clarity, when I say unfairly discriminatory, I mean not tied to underlying loss costs. Fifth, when managing our business, product managers need to consider both accident year and calendar year results. Our pricing decisions are based on accident year data, which is determined by the actual timing of a loss or accident as our product offering provides coverage for accidents we expect to occur during our rate revision. Our calendar year results consist of all the losses and premiums for the year, which include the current accident year plus any runoff from prior accident years. Finally, we will discuss our premium earnings convention. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t change rates on our entire book of business overnight. Rather, rate changes start earning in when a rate revision goes live either upon filing or after approval by Department of Insurance and that depends on the state. While new customers see the rate changes immediately, existing policyholders\u2019 rates will change at their next renewal event. As a result, it takes time for rate changes to earn in. Fortunately, Progressive writes mostly 6-month policies, which allows us to earn rates faster than many competitors who issue a higher mix of annual policies. Let me start with the auto pricing group. Pricing\u2019s goal is to deliver best-in-class tools to enable product managers to make risk-based decisions and to provide an accurate view of rate adequacy for our auto business. Think of this as the science behind the ratemaking. Given our beginnings as a non-standard writer and evolution to become a leader in segmentation and product innovation, we have honed our pricing sophistication for nearly 85 years. We continue to invest in attracting and retaining high-quality talent, building systems and processes to make sure we can accurately price a very complex product in a high-quality manner and advancing the science of pricing to improve our assessments of rate adequacy. The pricing indication is the key tool we use to determine our indicated rate need. It helps product managers answer the question how much do I need to raise or lower rates in my next rate revision to achieve the target combined ratio or better on an accident year basis. The indication is based upon two primary loss ratio calculations. The numerator is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we expect for policies that we will write in the upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. The denominator is the target loss ratio. This is the loss ratio we need to achieve to have enough premium left over to cover our prospective non-loss costs and profit load. The difference between these two ratios is the indicated rate need for the next revision. Let me provide more detail on how we determine the target loss ratio. Our goal is to price policies in a way that we will collect enough premium to cover our expected loss costs, loss adjustment expense, operating and acquisition costs, and have enough left over to hit our 4% profit margin. The chart on the slide depicts the various components to determine this loss ratio. And in this example, as you can see, our target loss ratio is 66%. It\u2019s very important to note that changes in our non-indemnity cost structure can result in changes in our target loss ratio and thus having a low cost structure is very important. All else equal, if expenses are lower, our target loss ratio will be higher and we can charge customers less for the same protection. The other key input into our indication is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we would expect for policies we are going to write in an upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. As I said earlier, we do not know what our loss cost will be when we write policies. And given our 4% profit target, we need to be very accurate in our projection. So, how do we get there? This requires us to adjust our historical accident year losses and premiums to reflect our best estimates of the future. Let me talk a little bit about the adjustments we make to our losses first. The first consideration is loss development, which is the process of estimating the ultimate frequency and severity of our claims. Since rate-making is prospective, we need to know how much will recent claims change from what we know about them today. We also need to know how many more claims will be reported from this time period and how much they will cost and change over time. To develop our historical frequency and severity, we analyzed historical development patterns using a variety of methodologies to help us achieve accurate estimates. Second, we also need to adjust for weather, which can be highly volatile over time. Our goal here is to price to a longer term average to make sure that we are not over or under-reacting to recent weather events. Once losses are fully developed, both frequency and severity are trended to the midpoint of the rate revision period. The midpoint represents the average cost of goods sold of losses during the revision. There are many factors that can impact our loss trends from macroeconomic variables such as inflation and gas prices to improve safety technology, to law changes and even our mix of business. We monitor these to understand where frequency and severity maybe headed and we update our trends on a monthly basis. On the premium side, we make two important adjustments. First, we adjust historical premium levels and bring them to current rate level to reflect our most recent pricing. Second, premiums also have trends, which are largely a function of changes in our mix of business. We need to account for the fact that our premiums can change due to the segments we write. We do not want to change rates simply because our mix of business changes over time. Our indications contain many inputs to help us project the future. And as a result, there is pricing risk. Let me share a few examples of the strategies we employ to manage this. First, when possible, we would like to rely on the most recent accident periods, which allow us to be responsive to our most recent experience and limits the trending period. Here, our data scale is a big asset as it affords us increased precision and prevents us from reacting to noise. The second is our high frequency of rate revision. This allows us to price to a shorter rate revision length and to be more responsive to changes in our indications. You have probably heard us say that we take smaller and more frequent bites at the apple. As a result, it is common for product managers to complete multiple revisions in a year. This is true in general, but not always as we are currently taking much larger bites in the current rapidly escalating loss cost environment to ensure rate adequacy. The third is our high mix of 6-month policies. As I mentioned earlier, once a rate revision goes live, it takes time to earn into the book, because we need to wait for policies to renew into the new rate level. As you would expect, 6-month policies earn in roughly twice as fast as annual policies. Our high mix of 6-month policies dramatically increases the speed with which new rates earn into our results. As you can imagine, COVID was a massive shock to our business and has forced us to adapt our pricing indications in multiple ways. Today, I am going to use collision coverage as a quick case study to highlight the impact on our loss trends and to share our responses. This slide contains a time series view of our collision coverage frequency, severity and pure premium through the end of 2019. It represents a pre-COVID period. The solid line is monthly data. You will notice that this data can be bumpy, which is largely due to seasonality. The dotted lines represent the trailing 12-month average. As you can see, during this time, our trends are relatively stable. Pure premiums were increasing on average by slightly more than 3% per year, with frequency gradually decreasing and severity growing faster than the rate of inflation. During this time, we were tracking a variety of variables that could help inform where we thought trends might be headed in the future. One thing we did not expect was once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. On this slide, the data has been updated through April 2020 to reflect the onset of COVID. As you are aware, a massive decrease in driving significantly reduced our collision frequency. This also dramatically changed our data and challenged us to think of new ways to project trends. The key question we needed to answer was how quickly will frequency rebound? To help us answer this question, we leveraged a variety of data elements to inform future projections of frequency. This data came from a variety of sources. First, we closely monitor our claims frequency data to understand both monthly changes and comparisons to pre-COVID levels. Second, we leveraged our extensive snapshot data, which we know is highly correlated with frequency. This data provides a daily view of vehicle miles traveled and important segment level data on driving patterns such as time of day and day of week. Third, we utilized input from product managers who brought local knowledge about changes to driving in their respective states. By analyzing this data over time, we could start to quantify with what likelihood, by how much and when frequency might return to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is conducted at a state, channel and coverage level and we update it very frequently. This slide shows the same three graphs through the end of 2021. As you can see, our collision pure premiums have rapidly accelerated to well above historic levels. While frequency has rebounded, it is still below where it was prior to the pandemic. However, collision severity has dramatically increased driven by supply chain disruptions and the soaring prices of used cars. Like frequency, our response for severity has been to leverage new data sources like the Manheim Index to explain the causes of these increases and where they might be headed in the future. In collision, more than half of our lost dollars are from total losses as we pay to replace total vehicles damaged beyond net cash value. This plot is showing the average value of used cars from Manheim in orange and the estimate of actual cash value, or ACV, of the vehicles we write estimates on in blue. Not surprisingly, what we see is a very strong correlation between these two metrics with ACV lagging in Manheim by a few months. Given this, signals of upward movement in car values are a leading indicator of ACV estimates and severity. With this data, we are better able to evaluate scenarios of where severity maybe headed in the future, with the cones representing the fact that there is still a high level of uncertainty. Given there is a high level of uncertainty of where our trends and therefore, our rate need might be headed, I want to share with you how we ensure we are getting our latest views of rate adequacy to product managers in a timely manner. As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to frequently update our trend analysis and pricing indications so that product managers can quickly respond to changing market conditions. Our indications are updated quarterly for each state, channel and coverage combination, which generates thousands of pricing recommendations per year. As I mentioned earlier, we updated our loss trends and premium trends on a monthly basis. Given the rapidly changing trend environment due to COVID, we are now able to update the trend portion of our indications monthly, which provides product managers even more up-to-date data on changes to their rate indications. This allows product managers to adjust their plans as the needs of their business change. And now, I will hand the presentation over to Kanik who will provide an update on how product managers leverage our pricing science to deliver our operational goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a 96 combined ratio.\nKanik Varma: Thanks, John. The goal of the product management organization is to deliver profitable growth at our target margin through adapting Progressive\u2019s products to win in our local markets. This organization comprises of highly talented individuals. They are results oriented and were attracted by profit and loss ownership. They want accountability and decision rights and we empower them to make decisions at the local level. Think of them as Chief Operating Officers of their own businesses. There are several aspects to our Product Manager\u2019s job at Progressive. Each product, state, channel is different and our Product Manager\u2019s design strategies to meet our goals within the individual businesses. Compliance is mandatory. Profit is our second priority. Growth at target margins comes next. Managing legislative, regulatory developments and relationships are key levers in order to respond to economic conditions and the competitive environment within their states. Today, I am going to focus on one aspect of their role, tactics to deliver our target margins. And this is especially relevant in the current environment. The first step in consistently hitting our target margins is to give our product managers very clear operational goals. You know it as our grow as fast as you can at a 96 objective. Just a reminder, that\u2019s a composite calendar year target number. Product Managers manage to their respective targets within their channel product or geography down to the line coverage level. Each business fulfills their role within the overall portfolio to meet this composite goal. Our product managers have multiple tools that help us operationalize this goal. We call it the product manager toolkit. Product managers actively monitor results with daily reporting on volume measures and monthly data across all other KPIs. The toolkit affords both diagnostics and informs actions to ensure we deliver segment level results that roll up to our aggregate objectives. At the macro aggregate level, operationalizing this objective is like riding a wave. It requires a very delicate balance, go do fast with rate and you will be ahead of the market in compromise growth. However, if you move too slowly and fall behind on rate, it\u2019s incredibly hard to catch back up and you will miss profitability targets. Product managers continuously adjust rate level to match changing conditions and the capability to be nimble is a source of competitive advantage for Progressive. Our product managers are not just trying to hit 96 at the macro level, but are making sure they are pricing each individual segment the same target margins. That\u2019s very important. We don\u2019t have a bias towards any specific customer segment. We want to drive growth across the spectrum, provided those risks of price accurately. This approach enables us to deliver on our broad acceptance or what we call take nearly all comers philosophy. Our heritage starting out writing less preferred customers required us to align our entire business around matching rate to risk. And as we have expanded our aperture over the past decades, this approach remains foundational to our strategy. We have to make sure we are continuously matching rate to risk. Our scale provides us credible data and to make data-driven decisions at the micro level, which is a competitive advantage versus many industry competitors. Product upgrades in each state allow us to add new rating wearables to our algorithms that feeds the virtuous cycle of risk selection. We have talked about this at length in the past. So today, I will just focus on how product managers manage profitability at the macro level. The aggregate rate level is determined for each state and channel. Each product manager decides how much rate to take and how often to take that rate for the state and channel they manage. This decision-making relies very heavily on the advanced analytics John talked about earlier. Product managers also incorporate multiple local inputs into their decisions. I\u2019d like to group these local inputs into three broad categories: state-specific loss trends; regulatory framework within the state; the mix of business we ensure in each state as that drives the earnings cadence. Let\u2019s walk through each one of these one-by-one. The first category of inputs is state-specific loss trends. Each state is unique and states have different loss trends at any given point of time. There are many reasons for this in the auto product. Coverages and limits offered are based on unique state laws. State laws change often and have a direct effect on loss costs going forward. Example of this would be injury limit increases, fee schedule changes and new case law. States have unique weather patterns that impact loss costs. For example, hill states differ from hurricane states and we use different weather loads in these states. Claims processes are different by state and we keep improving them to make sure we are paying accurately. Process changes like labor rate changes, litigation and fraud mitigation strategies can have an impact on loss costs and LAE. These are all different by state. And during the COVID pandemic, states had different lockdown and reopening laws. Product managers work closely with our cross-functional partners in their states. These partners provide valuable local market input and we incorporate those into our decisions. The second input that impacts decision-making at the state level is rate regulations. At a very basic level, there are two types of rate regulation mechanisms, file and use in prior approval. In file and use states, we could elevate rate changes literally the day after we file. Though approval for the revision in these states can come months and in some cases years after the rates are effective. Prior approval means a state DOI needs to approve their revision before its effective. This framework requires more time to get rates to the street. But even before approval and prior approval states, we typically go through a back and forth with regulators as they ask questions and we explain our data and answer that questions about what\u2019s changing with the specific revision. We call this the objection process. But don\u2019t be confused, these are questions raised to clarify and understand and not fix barriers to implementing our product changes. Over decades, we have built incredibly strong relationships with our regulators as both credible and transparent operators and we continue to work closely with regulators to ensure they are comfortable with what we are doing, why we are doing it and how, what we are doing ensures we deliver rates that are adequate, are not excessive, and are not unfairly discriminatory. When trends changes, usually with a first carrier to share the latest credible data with state regulators. So it\u2019s fairly normal for them to react to new information and ask questions and ask for support to confirm understanding. In practice though, there are 51 different enforcement mechanisms, no two are alike. Each has to be managed independently. We have built the institutional knowledge and dedicated resources to put together filings and additional support, to ensure we get the right price into every local market as quickly as possible. Each product manager has in-depth understanding of the state\u2019s regulatory mechanism. They are on top of the unique deviations which means we have to know how to calculate rate need on the state\u2019s template, how much rate can be approved under a certain mechanism, the flex bands and how often we can file in a year. They also manage the approval timelines, which can vary based on the type of filing within each state. While we price our policies to run consistently at or below a 96 accident year combined ratio prospectively, we also manage our results to a calendar year 96 combined ratio target. In order to do that, product managers need to plan for the time it takes for rate changes to earn into our financials. It\u2019s important to note that because we have a large book of in-force business rate changes don\u2019t affect all policies at the same time. All new policies going forward are written on the new rates, but existing policies don\u2019t see a rating until they come up for renewal. Our combined ratio is a function of losses and expenses divided by earned premium. To put things into perspective, this is a chart of how much time it takes for that earned premium to reflect the new rates on our Personal Auto policies. With a predominantly 6-month book of business, if we increase rates by 5% today, 5 months from now, our earned premium, which is the denominator for the combined ratio, would have increased approximately 3.5%. And by month 7, we will be close to that 5%. So the rate we took in the second half of 2021, around 6%, will have largely earned into the financials by midyear. Any rate we will take now will partially offset the first half and, more materially, the second half\u2019s combined ratio. For comparison, if a carrier had 75% of their policies as annuals, it will take even longer as only 65% of the premium would be at the right rate level 7 months after the change. This is a big reason we\u2019ve limited distribution of 12-month policies to primarily our Platinum agencies, while over 90% of our Personal Auto policies are 6-month policies. And at times like these, we benefit from a shorter lag period to realize rate changes in our book. Let\u2019s use one example to show you how one auto product manager made high-level decisions over the last couple of years. This is a real example from one medium-sized state. The gray line on the chart is monthly pure premium in that state, while the blue line is a trailing 12-month average pure premium. This takes out the weather-related seasonality in the state. In 2019, the state was running under a 96 combined ratio, and our loss cost trends were fairly stable in the state. With stable trends, the product manager was focused on growth strategies, which typically include lowering rates to convert more shoppers or increasing demand generation spend to generate more shoppers. As early COVID-related frequency drop came through our data, the product manager responded, first, by participating in our April relief efforts. That included $1 billion of premium credits during the immediate post-COVID period. That was followed by an aggregate rate level decrease a couple of months later. In early 2021, as this product manager was evaluating their aggregate rate level, based on the data available at the time, they expected trends to start returning to pre-COVID level at a fairly slow pace. The state\u2019s pure premium expectations at the time are shown in the orange line. At this point of time, our tools indicated no immediate rate action, nor did local conditions in the state weren\u2019t anything different. Our ability to review trends and rate level every month allow this product manager to very quickly spot a change in trend shortly after making their rate decision. This change in loss cost trend was supported by UBI data in the state, which you\u2019re driving returning at a faster pace than previously expected. There was enough credibility in the data for the product manager to react and the adjusted rate level upwards to reflect the change in frequency trend. As time went on, severity continued to rise at a faster pace than expected back in May, especially in collision comprehensive property damage coverages. Frequency also continued to see modest positive trend as driving behavior reverted back to normal. At this point, the product manager took another rate adjustment to ensure they would hit the accident year 96 and calendar year 96 combined ratio objectives. Since we\u2019re in the business of trying to predict the future, there is near certainty that we will be wrong. However, our business model is to minimize this error by shortening our future pricing time horizon to provide more frequent opportunities to adjust our future prices to market conditions. Our product managers have the advantage of getting updated indications and other diagnostics often and have the resources to act when needed. This allows us to react very quickly when conditions are changing and when the regulatory framework allows it. As Tricia shared, this approach of taking more frequent smaller bites of the apple continues to serve us well as our rates are more closely aligned with true underlying costs, which enables us to deliver more consistent underwriting profitability and more competitive rates that drive long-term growth. If a carrier either does not have the ability to review data often and/or does not have the flexibility to react quickly, you can fall behind on rate need. The margin of error grows the longer you have to wait to react. This is why we have invested heavily in the tools to evaluate trend quickly, and the systems to react as fast as possible. This chart also illustrates the challenge in states with longer approval times. Our product managers deploy different strategies to manage rate revision length risk in states where we aren\u2019t afforded the flexibility to change rates as often as necessary to accurately match rate to risk. Our product managers typically act earlier and more conservatively to ensure we have adequate rates while making sure they are not excessive. They also have a full toolkit of levers available to deploy, to protect the book and meet their target margins. We just talked about the science and the product manager toolkit. Now let\u2019s talk about how we deploy changes to the market. Having data and analytics to inform pricing decision-making is necessary, but not sufficient to effectively manage a book of business. You must also have decision makers and the deployment resources to file in a timely manner, get regulators comfortable with our actions and the IT infrastructure to get the updated pricing to market. In the example I shared, this particular product manager implemented 10 rate revisions in the state in the last 2 years alone, five each for direct and five for agency. These actions resulted in the state meeting its profit targets, both years in a very dynamic market and achieving 7.4% earned premium growth last year or over 25% earned premium growth over the 2-year period while continuing to keep us ahead of the industry on segmentation. The backbone of our deployment capabilities is our rate revision factory. We have the ability to act multiple times in a year in every state. Our resources dedicated for product upgrades are incremental to those for rate increases. Just to give you an idea. Last year, we deployed over four rate revisions per state in auto, and approximately 60% of our premium picked up the latest product model. It\u2019s also important to note, each tool in the product manager toolkit is supported with dedicated IT infrastructure. These are separate systems and resources that are incremental to our rate revision factory. That gives us added flexibility to deploy our tools as needed in individual states. We have long seen revision deployment and cadence as a potential source of competitive advantage, which is why several years ago, we invested in the factory to increase its throughput and improve its quality to ensure we can continue to lead in both pricing and segmentation. We believe this investment has provided us with best-in-class capabilities. And this is just a view of our auto product. Each business, commercial, recreational lines and property, have, incremental dedicated capabilities. Our ability to react early to changes in market conditions creates opportunities for us. The last time the market hardened, we followed our playbook and reacted fast and decisively. We believe faster response times help us compress the industry cyclicality during both hard and soft markets. That continues to drive our growth during times of change. This market cycle may be different in magnitude but requires a similar playbook. We reacted as soon as we saw trends turned in 2020 in addition to the $1 billion April relief effort. Trends changed direction in 2021, and we reacted immediately. We\u2019ve had a head start, and we will continue to react quickly as we see changes in the results in either direction. While we can\u2019t know if this cycle will play out exactly like cycles of the past, we do continue to have trust in our process and believe it will help us deliver the best possible results. Thank you.\nDoug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including John Curtiss and Kanik Varma, who can answer questions about the rate level presentation. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question \u2013 thanks for all the disclosure just on the rating side of things. Given where you guys are now, the rates that you mentioned, the 8 points that you guys took last year as well as just what seems like continued elevated severity, when do you think you will potentially be at your target margins within Personal Auto? If I remember from last \u2013 the call last quarter seemed to indicate perhaps it would take 6 months or longer. I just want to understand kind of where we are in the time frame of you guys thinking we will have enough rate to kind of get back to where you want your margins to be in auto, just in Personal Auto.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. And I think that\u2019s very dependent on each state. So we feel good where we\u2019re at now. So we took the 8 points last year, took another 3 points in Personal Auto in January. And we\u2019ve had some successes with some of the regulators. So let me give you an example. In Texas \u2013 I think that came up in the last call. We \u2013 they had some objections. We went back and forth with a lot of data, came to an agreement earlier this month, and both of those prior \u2013 those approvals are done and effective, I think, on the 24th. And then we\u2019ve put another rate increase in February. So we feel good about states like Texas where we\u2019ve had great conversations with our regulators, and we can get the rates on the street. And that allows us to open up local advertising, our bill plans that we might have restricted underwriting guidelines and \u2013 our underwriting restrictions, I should say. And so it\u2019s a mixed bag depending on each state. So we will continue to watch the trends. The trends in used cars and new cars still continue to actually outpace even pre-COVID levels. And of course, a lot depends on frequency. So we saw vehicle miles traveled down more in January. We think that might have been through Omicron. So they were down about 11% to 14% compared to our percentage of about 7% to 8% since May. Now that we\u2019re seeing more states open, we will watch frequency closely. So we\u2019re watching companies open. And what the new normal is of how people go back to work, I think, is yet to be determined. I know with Progressive, we are just figuring that out as well. There\u2019ll be a lot more people that work from home or work from home part of the time. So we\u2019re going to watch frequency once things stabilize a little bit more. So the real answer is we don\u2019t know for sure. But hopefully, John and Kanik let you understand that the propensity to have the majority of our auto policy 6 months allow us that flexibility to get the rate in more quickly.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up. Tricia, you did kind of touch upon in your answer. When I look at your results January versus December, typically, there is been some better seasonality in January, but this January saw almost 6 points of better underlying loss ratio relative to December, and severity remains high, as you guys noted. So did frequency drive a net benefit in your January numbers perhaps from Omicron? And then is there anything that you can say about February as Omicron has waned and just the impact perhaps in that month?\nTricia Griffith: I think that\u2019s probably part of it. I think there is a lot of seasonality in January. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that too much because we still have a lot of that rate to earn in. What I would say, early results from February from vehicle miles traveled, they are going back to what we saw before January. So we could see frequency go up a little bit. Again, that\u2019s yet to be determined, and we will have those results in a few weeks.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Great presentation. First question, Tricia, to your comments about in the past, during times of industry disruption, you\u2019ve been able to \u2013 the company has been able to make great strides. Just curious, is \u2013 obviously, every cycle is different, as you all mentioned. Is the window of opportunity just very different this time given that it appears Progressive results have deteriorated much more so than peers, which maybe could be due to being overweighted non-standard drivers? Are you seeing kind of a bifurcation of results, non-standard versus standard, which might make other peers less likely to need as much rate?\nTricia Griffith: Well, when we kind of strip away at the Q4 results from some of our competitor, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good company. It looks like almost everybody needs a similar rate than we do. So we\u2019re monitoring that. I mean as far as our book of non-standard, of course, that\u2019s \u2013 that was our humble beginnings, but we are \u2013 we continue to grow more on the preferred side. When you think about new business, our apps are down more on the Sams, which makes total sense because they are very sensitive to price. We define them as inconsistently insured. And of course, a lot of the PIF growth on the Sam side comes from the new apps because their PLEs are really short. So I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I would say I think everybody in these rates. The trends changed as you saw dramatically. And so I feel like we\u2019re in a really good position. We continue to work with regulators where we don\u2019t have the right rates on the Street yet to prove that out. And if we need to, we will slow growth for a bit until we get there.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. Thank you. My follow-up is just trying to \u2013 maybe if you can try to unpack some of the severity statistics a little bit more. You focus on the Manheim in the deck it looks like. But just curious, we\u2019re also hearing about supply chain issues requiring cars to be taking longer to fix, higher rental car prices. Just curious, are you \u2013 are any of the other issues that have been impacting severity, are they getting better? Are they decelerating? Or is there still a lot of uncertainty? Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Mike, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty, but I think you hit the nail on the head. So we\u2019ve got the supply-demand issues with chips. So we have parts prices continue to increase. Because it\u2019s taking longer to repair those, our rental prices have gone up. We\u2019re watching labor rates in body shops closely and working with our MSOs to understand what we think about that. But when you think about severity, we look at it in a couple of different ways, but I\u2019ve been focusing on looking at it from this last quarter, quarter four of 2021 compared to \u201819. And let\u2019s take collision as an example, and we don\u2019t usually share at this level. But in the aggregate, we are up in severity about 11.9%. Collisions, up substantially more than that. And actually, frequency is down less than pre-COVID, and severity is up. So we\u2019re watching very specific line coverages to understand the trends and how they relate to the increases that we need specifically.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. First, I just had a question on the sort of \u2013 if you could discuss what\u2019s going on in California. It\u2019s a small state for you guys, but I don\u2019t think the state has approved any pricing request yet. So what\u2019s the reason for that? And do you think that, that will change as you have more of the sort of weaker margins in your actual experience that gets built into their analysis?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean we continue to work with regulators in California. It can be a challenge, and we\u2019re up for the challenge. We \u2013 how they might look at rates versus we are looking at them prospectively, I think, is a little bit different. And so we\u2019re sharing data regarding what we\u2019re seeing and the trends we need. Here\u2019s the bottom line for any regulators. They should demand adequate rates. And we need to get adequate rates on the street in California in every jurisdiction for that matter. So we\u2019re going to continue to work with California. And there is a handful of other states where we continue to go back and forth. And our goal is to be open and available for all consumers. And if we\u2019re open and available, that helps with affordability in the long run. So in the meantime, we have some levers that we can use to slow down growth, whether it\u2019s local advertising or build plans, underwriting restrictions and some agents incentives, we will do that in the states where we need rate. We do need rate in California, but we will continue to work with the regulators there to prove our case.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the competitive environment, are you seeing competitors take similar price hikes? And \u2013 or are some of them not doing the same? And as a result, like as we\u2019ve seen your premium growth slow down a lot, bit growth slowed down a lot recently, but not sure if that\u2019s because other companies are not raising to the same extent or they have more 12-month policies where they can\u2019t implement the price hikes?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. There is a lot of variables like that. Some you hit the nail on the head with 12 months, some are not increasing at the rate we are. We are usually first to market, and we talk about that a lot in order to get ahead of trends. We do see competitors definitely taking rates. And so we knew taking action aggressively early on when we saw the trends changed so dramatically. We knew that would affect our new business apps. We\u2019re seeing that, but we feel good about getting those rates on the Street. And as more and more companies see those rates, the competitive environment will improve. And hopefully, as people shop, they\u2019ll come to us and we will be in a good position to have stable rates. So it\u2019s really across the board. Some are taking a different approach because they have 12-month policies, some run their companies differently than we do. We have a very specific goal to make that $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so that is our primary goal and growth a second. So we will continue to watch. We believe that we feel like we\u2019re in a good position for the most part.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question, Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your comments on getting ahead of the trends and being first to market and then your comments of taking larger bites. Question really is, do you classify what you took any time in 2021, maybe 4Q, the 6.8 in those 19 states? Was that a larger bite or was that more of the smaller bites? And the reason I asked, Tricia, is curious if you think that 6.8 in those 19 states, was that enough to offset and provide some profit provision in that? Or is there more needed from even that 4Q number?\nTricia Griffith: It\u2019s very dependent on each state. So there are some states where there is more needed. I gave you the example of Texas where we had two rate revisions and we put another one in play, a double-digit one in February. So I think it\u2019s very dependent on the jurisdiction. I would say when we define small bites, it\u2019s nice for consumers to have stable rates. So small bites to me, and I don\u2019t think there is any great definition, is 1% here, 1% there. So I never like to take 6.8% or ever double-digit percentage because we see then that, one, it affects our new business and could ultimately affect our renewal business as people get increases. So that, to me, is a larger bite. But again, we saw these dramatic trends, and we needed to get out in front of it.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks. Kind of a related question, I guess. But some of their comments here where we\u2019re starting to feel good about where we are today, going to wait for that to earn in. What do you think that means for how we should expect to see the marketing spend this year relative to last year?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we will plan to spend as much as we can on marketing as long as we feel like rates are \u2013 the rates we have out there are appropriate as well as the fact that our acquisition costs go within our target \u2013 we want to have our targeted acquisition cost. So what the levers that we will use in places where we don\u2019t think we have the rate just yet will be to turn off or slow down local advertising. We have some great plans around marketing. Again, we will \u2013 that will be dependent on each jurisdiction and where we feel we are as far as rate adequacy.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I guess the first question, I\u2019ll go to the projected loss ratio slides. I think that\u2019s like Slide 21 \u2013 20, 21. Well, you know the slides. You put them together. There is two pieces in there. There is the new business piece and the renewal piece. And I\u2019m just curious about your perspective on new business. Traditionally, there is been a new business penalty. And I\u2019m curious what your views are on new business penalty in this environment. And I\u2019m wondering if it differs between, say, the agency segment and the direct segment, etcetera.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Well, I think of the new business penalty, for me, more on the direct side in terms of front-loading our acquisition costs in the first 6 months of the policy. As far as the projected loss ratio, I mean, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m hoping to answer your question. I mean I think that our new business, obviously, is negative right now in, I think, every single segment. We saw it initially in the agency business. I think they are very susceptible to any price increases based on the fact that they have a lot of opportunity to put business with their customers with others. I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question or if you want to add anything.\nJohn Sauerland: I can add a little bit there. So there is really two objectives in pricing the business. One is the lifetime profitability of a customer and the other is hitting our calendar year targets, and we\u2019re trying to achieve both, and sometimes there is a balance there to be had. As Tricia was noting in the direct business, new business runs a lot hotter than renewals. So because of that advertising expense that we incur completely upfront, less so in the agency channel, but we also see differing new versus renewal loss ratio differences across segments of customers. So there is a bigger new business penalty when you\u2019re in the non-standard end of the spectrum relative to the preferred end of the spectrum. So we\u2019re trying to balance the lifetime profitability of those customers as well as the calendar year profitability of the entire business when we\u2019re making those decisions. As we were noting earlier, there are certainly markets right now where the underlying base rate level, if you will, is not adequate. And so those cases, we are restricting as much as we can because we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re not going to hit our target margin on a lifetime basis for that business. There are other markets where we\u2019re closer, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re playing the underwriting, the advertising levers to manage that again to the calendar year, but also to the lifetime targets.\nGreg Peters: Thank you. That was actually an excellent color on my question, which was kind of vague. Thank you. The second and follow-up question and I\u2019m going to go off script here, if you\u2019ll allow me, because I\u2019d like to pivot to the commercial lines business for a second. And we get so few opportunities to talk with you. And the Commercial Lines business continues to, one, grow rapidly; two, produce results that are well in excess of your targets. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s going on there? What areas of the market you\u2019re having success in? And just give us a state of the union on the Commercial Lines business, please?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Absolutely. We feel incredibly proud of our results, both on the growth and profit over the last couple of years. One of the biggest areas in Commercial Lines where we\u2019ve been able to grow is in our for-hire transportation segment, which makes a lot of sense. During COVID, goods need to be transferred across the country. Many of us stopped shopping and ordered. And so we really we\u2019re in a great position to improve and increase our market share in that specific segment. We\u2019ve been writing that for a lot of years. So the good news is we knew the underlying cost structure. We were conservative in our take rate. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, there is a couple of other things. We continue to grow in our TNC business. We added Protective as another part of our fleet. And across the board, we feel pretty good about growth \u2013 really good about growth in all of our BMTs. So just a really great part of the story where we saw an opportunity, we had the background and experience to write a lot more of that, and we took advantage of it.\nJohn Sauerland: I get excited talking about Commercial Lines, so I\u2019ll tack on here. We\u2019ve got a number of other things going on there, I think, are not as appreciated in the market as perhaps they should be. So usage-based rating in Commercial is going really well. It\u2019s really predictive. Obviously, those trucks are driving a lot of miles. So the differential across those who are good drivers and those who are less good is pretty significant, and we\u2019re pricing to that. We also have that information for a large group of customers at new business because truckers now have electronic logging devices that have that information, and we can input that into the new business rate. Relative to the Personal side where predominantly, we\u2019re still using the information we gather at renewal versus new business. So Smart Haul is going really, really well. We also have a program we call Snapshot ProView that is also working well for smaller fleets. The other piece of Commercial that I think is pretty exciting is the direct channel. So we\u2019ve all been sort of wondering when Commercial customers will sort of follow the Personal side and start shopping a bit more in the direct channel. COVID certainly, I think helped accelerate that and we are seeing great growth in our direct channel and commercial lines. I could go on into the BOP program as well. So, I think you are right to say, hey, it\u2019s a very exciting segment of the business right now, the core, what we call business market targets, the trucks, etcetera, are doing really well, and we have got a lot of long-term runway to play in commercial lines beyond that.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Our BOP program is now in 34 states. We added 17 this year. So, obviously still small, but something, as I outlined, probably last year, a few years ago, our different horizons, we are excited about helping ensure those small businesses. So, that\u2019s something that we think there is a lot of runway.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Thank you. Looking through the 10-K, I was surprised at how much ad spending you did during 2021. And that tells me there is probably more seasonality in there than I am understanding, I assume it was heavily first half weighted. So could you, a, talk about the normal seasonality of ad spending at the firm? Talk about how that differed in 2021. And then the third part is that means that most of the savings that you guys did on the expense ratio really came from the G&A expense. How much of that expense can you save into \u201822 and later?\nTricia Griffith: Well, it\u2019s a multifaceted question. I would say, normally, we do spend a fair amount in the first half of any year, but we did dramatically reduce spend because of our profitability issues at the end of 2021. So, we wouldn\u2019t have normally reduced it by that much. We did that as a reactive position based on what we saw with trend. And so we spend depending on when we believe that people are open to shopping, and that can vary. So, we did spend more in January of this year. I don\u2019t know if Pat, do you want to add anything more to what we are feeling about from a media perspective.\nPat Callahan: No, I think your response on the seasonality of ad spend is absolutely right. We spend when that will be efficient, media spend, and frankly, when we think we are priced adequately for the new business coming in. So, once \u2013 as Kanik and John laid out, severity started to take off with frequency in the second half of last year. We had some rational pullback there just simply because we weren\u2019t comfortable with our rate level. Now, when we come into this year, as Tricia mentioned, we typically will spend more in Q1 ahead of what\u2019s typical shopping season. And that\u2019s what we saw in January, but it is more state-specific where we are open for business and turning on some media spend. Now, on a year-over-year basis, we had our best quarter ever in Q1 of 2021. So, from a spend and an efficiency perspective, we have got some tough comps coming ahead of us at this point in time. But really, our full year spend is 12 individual months of spend, highly controllable, on and off as we are comfortable with the efficiency of the spend and frankly, the adequacy of the underlying business we bring in for that spend.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you. And the permits of the G&A expense production in 2021?\nJohn Sauerland: So, we think of our non-acquisition spend as what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio, which generally you can think of as G&A expenses, the long-term trend there has been really good. So, we have taken out over the past, I don\u2019t know, probably decade maybe four points in our non-acquisition expense ratio. Obviously, that allows us to be really competitive. And our goal is to continue to reduce that number. So, we obviously have scale at our advantage. We obviously are investing heavily in technology to continue to get consumers to self-service and be happy doing so. So, a lot of efforts around continuing to be competitive in our cost structure outside of acquisition, we would \u2013 if we are priced adequately, we would love to spend more on advertising. Obviously, we are going to have competitive commission for our agents to place as much business as they can with us. But the underlying G&A or non-acquisition expense ratio is where we focus on continuing to get more competitive.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning and thanks for the call. Covered a lot of ground, obviously, and very helpful. But I wanted to ask on the home business, how impactful could it be that on the auto business that you are trying to improve the profitability of the home business at the same time?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think we like to bundle, but we also want to make sure that we are positioned well for the long-term growth in the property channel. And we have continued to increase our Robinsons. We are proud of that. We want to do that \u2013 we just want to do it in \u2013 spread across more non-volatile weather states, so that we can make our target margin on those bundled customers. So, will we lose some customers from some of the de-risking decisions we are making in Florida on the auto side, likely, that might happen. We will wait to see how that happens. And of course, that also depends on what\u2019s happening in the environment. So, when people shop, are they getting the same or better rate if they go to another competitor. So a lot of that, specifically in Florida, will be dependent on what the competitors do as well. So, I think people that want to bundle, you may take both your auto and home with you. We will work on trying to keep as much of the auto book of the property that we lose. But that\u2019s yet to be known as we continue our plan to de-risk.\nJohn Sauerland: And in the direct channel, we do have the luxury of having multiple other companies that we work with, the place property business, and we will proactively work with those companies to try and place business that we no longer want to be writing on our own paper. And obviously, in the independent agency channel, most agencies have multiple options. So, I mean you are right. As Tricia noted, we will likely lose some auto business as we reduce the risk in our homeowners book, but we also expect to keep a lot of those auto customers because of the options that we have in the direct channel as well as that \u2013 which our agents have.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. And I should do a shout-out because we have really invested a lot over the years in HomeQuote Explorer, where you can \u2013 we can go online, and now we have 34 states where you can have an online buy, which makes it just easier for consumers as well if they are shopping. So, they may have auto with Progressive, and the home could be with Progressive property, but then they could switch over to another one of our unaffiliated partners. So, John is right on point.\nPaul Newsome: And then I wanted to read the commercial auto business, but in the context of \u2013 you gave us some wonderful detail and information about private passenger auto and the frequency and severity trends that you have seen. But my sense is that, that result has been quite different in commercial auto. And I was wondering if you might touch upon those differences and why that might be?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. The severity on commercial is up. When you look at the trailing 12 over the prior 12, up right around just under 14%, and frequency has come back to pre-COVID levels for the most part. We see a lot with our \u2013 as John said, we have our telematics on the commercial auto side. We see that speeding for some of our truckers are up about 10% to 20%. And we see that sort of correlated when there is more congestion out versus less congestion. So yes, those are higher limit policies. Obviously, we have talked in the past about social inflation around more attorney rep claims. So, we are seeing an increase in those trends in the commercial lines product as well.\nPaul Newsome: Okay. Thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next call is from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. First question, going back to the ad spend. In direct, I think we saw over three points of sequential increase in the expense ratio in January. How much of that is from the marketing and advertising seasonality versus other seasonality and maybe just other?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I would say a portion of it, I said \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t take one month, like you said, for much. I think expenses are usually up in January regardless, and a portion of it was media, but not a huge amount.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then in the 10-K, bodily injury severity has been elevated all through 2021. Why would we see the year-over-year increases in \u201821 when I think we already saw the impact from greater speeding and kind of more material accident velocity, if you will, in 2020. So, what\u2019s driving the increase in \u201821? And how much visibility do you have into the bodily injury severity going forward?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. A lot of it in \u2013 at least in Q4 would be around attorney rep rate, and so a lot of the medical inflation. We also, as we have been hiring on new claims reps, that \u2013 the propensity to how the handling is done and the accuracy can be a little bit different as those claims reps get trained. And so that was probably a part of it as well. So, that\u2019s what we are seeing in quarter four. But a lot of the inflation is around attorney rep rate. And it will be interesting to see as more and more treatment facilities open up if that changes as well. So, we will watch that closely.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. On insurance, I really like your rate-making presentation, super helpful. So, I have a quick numbers question, and then my follow-up is more conceptual on the numbers in your 10-K. You mentioned it\u2019s better to assess 2021 loss trend versus 2019 and year-over-year. So, if I just zero in on your reported severity auto physical damage, what is driving the more muted 8% for \u201821 versus \u201819, then the 9% in 2020 versus 2019? I guess I would assume supply chain disruptions would take a larger toll in 2021 on auto physical damage.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think just used car parts similar to collision, but you might see it a little bit of a delay. But used car prices, parts prices, rental car increases, all those things are coming into play as well. We just think that it\u2019s good to look at, especially \u2013 I even think not even just year-over-year when we compare to \u201819. We obviously have that data. But there is so much changing right now that I am really looking at quarter-over-quarter comparison. So, that\u2019s where we are at on physical damage. We believe we will see similar trends continue to emerge from \u2013 similar the collision.\nTracy Benguigui: So, there is a delay in recognizing that? Is that what you are saying?\nTricia Griffith: Well, yes, there is a little bit of a delay in recognizing that. I think on \u2013 I think we see that from our competitors as well. We see that in our subrogation files of getting some of the data in from other companies in inbound sub, so a little bit of a delay, yes.\nJohn Sauerland: So, just a little clarity on what we are saying there. So, when we have a first-party total loss collision, we are going to pay that immediately. We are going to recognize the elevated cost of new and used cars right now when we are settling that claim. When we have a property damage claim, some of those claims we pay directly, and we would recognize that expense. Some of those claims \u2013 the parties are going through their personal auto carrier, and then that auto carrier reaches out to us and subrogates us, meaning they ask for the payment, and that is when we will see some of the increase in the total loss rate. We try and project that, obviously, in our reserves to be as accurate as possible in a world where it is moving as quick as it is right now, we don\u2019t always have that perfect. So, as we see more of those demands for total loss settlements from other insurance carriers, we are going to \u2013 we expect to see some similar experience in the property damage.\nTricia Griffith: I had mentioned that overall severity was up comparing \u201819 quarter four to \u201820 \u2013 to \u201821 quarter four at about 11.9 property damages. I said collision was up significantly from severity. Property damage is up as well, not as significant as collision, but it is higher than the 11.9.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Thank you so much. And I guess my next question is more conceptual. So, is my understanding that more Midwest states are on-board with the rate increases, and it just feels like the catastrophe prone states are driving their feet more. So, I am thinking that might be a function of regulators being sensitive to higher homeowner rates. So, they are trying to cap the auto rate increases to put a lid on the overall insurance premiums for its constituents. I am also seeing in regulatory filings, some states do not think miles driven is going to snap back to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a secular shift in a hybrid work environment. So basically, this is my long way \u2013 long and good way of asking you the psychology of rate increases by state and how that may impact your ability to achieve your indicated rate need?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think that we are all watching vehicle miles traveled and frequency closely. And it\u2019s not back to pre-COVID amounts. That said, severity is so far outpacing that from all the things we talked about. Whether it\u2019s medical inflation, car price, rental cars, et cetera, that we need rate and I have said this in the last call. And so there is \u2013 each individual like John and Kanik said, there is 51 jurisdictions we work with to try to make sure that our rates are adequate and not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. I do believe that regulators care a lot about their constituents. And so they want to be very careful as they increase the cost because there is other inflationary things that are happening in each household. So I can\u2019t get into the psychology of it because we are just such a data-driven company that \u2013 that\u2019s what we look at. And so we will continue to do so. And our hope is that we get a handful of states where we still need rate. We get that in short order. So, we can be open and available and affordable for every constituent in the entire United States.\nTracy Benguigui: Would it be fair to say you have to almost change the playbook by state just considering each nuanced concern?\nTricia Griffith: Absolutely. Yes. That\u2019s the fun part of working in a regulated industry because there is a lot of different personalities of each state. And we \u2013 and that product management relationship that we talked about is so integral to that success. And so we actually think that\u2019s a great advantage. And yes, each state is very different.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Good morning. Susan, you spoke a bit about some of the states where you are feeling good about in terms of what rates you have right now on the Street. Could you give us a sense for how much of the book right now is priced to where you think you can start turning on more ad spend and other growth levers? And also, any thoughts on timing of rolling out more ad spend across the rest of your brokers?\nTricia Griffith: Great question, difficult to answer. Like we said, we look at each state, and we were able to turn on local advertising \u2013 turn on and off local advertising pretty quickly. So, I mean as soon as we believe we have the rates right and that we can turn on media to get more new business at our allowable cost, we will do so. But it\u2019s really dependent on each state. We want to do that. We want to open up each lever to do that, but it really is dependent on getting not just in the states that we just talked about, but in every state to make sure we continue to stay ahead of trend.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the drivers of the deterioration in personal auto PIF growth in January. It took a step down, was kind of around like 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and then it took a step down to 4% year-over-year in January. And I am specifically talking about personal auto. I am just wondering, is that still \u2013 is that just still mainly new business that is driving that deterioration, or are we starting to see some of the renewal book start to get impacted by some of the rate increases, because I did see that the PLEs are still up, but that was obviously for 2021, and I am specifically wondering about January.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We still are seeing new business shrink, and that makes sense with our pricing. And from the renewal perspective, I think we talked about in the K that trailing three was dropping a little bit. And so it\u2019s reasonable to believe that trailing 12 could drop as well. But again, that\u2019s all dependent on what our competitors do as well. When we look at elasticity, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s happening here. It\u2019s what the competitors are doing. And we look at our renewal rates in sort of tranches of if we take plus 5%, 5% to 10%, etcetera, to see what happens. And we are seeing some \u2013 we believe some improvements from slowing down in some of the tranches where our competitors are taking rate. And that could mean we \u2013 there is a lot of variables here, that could mean that they are taking rates as well. So, when our customers get an increase in their renewal rate and they shop, they might stay because they can\u2019t get a better rate. Again, we are not seeing that play through yet in the trailing 12. The trailing three can be an indicator. And that\u2019s why we want to get out ahead of this to sort of get the rates stable as quickly as possible in 2022, so we can all focus on doing our job as an industry and be really competitive, drive down those costs so people have affordable ways to buy insurance.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. I thought I would ask a high-level one. I mean Slide 26 and 28 seem to pretty clearly show there is a significant range of outcomes here. And that would logically sort of make it harder to lean into your confidence on the lifetime value of customers and hitting the growth pedal. As I think through that dynamic, what would you need to see in terms of the range of outcomes and getting a little more certainty around at least how wide the range of outcomes is to be able to have confidence in that? I would think even at a adequate level of pricing for your base case, thinking through lifetime value still could be challenging with a wider range of outcomes. Can you just talk high level about how you think through that and when we could expect to have enough clarity to kind of lean in harder on growth?\nTricia Griffith: It\u2019s so hard to say because there are so many moving parts constantly. So, where we would think, okay, we come into February, the weather is going to be nicer, places are opening up, but then you have the invasion of Ukraine. So, what happens with fuel prices, although that\u2019s usually a small part of our frequency trend. We \u2013 I would say, if you have a couple of quarters of some stability in seeing what\u2019s happening as an example, to see if used car prices and the chip shortage starts to ease up, we would start to follow that and feel better about that. But we \u2013 our math, we believe, is accurate of what we need now, and that\u2019s really what we focus on in order to make sure that we ultimately have that lifetime value of that profitable growth of the 96.\nAlex Scott: Understood. And then I just wanted to make sure I am interpreting Slide 28 right. I know these cones are probably just rough guides. But in your base case, are you sort of inherently assuming here that the used car prices will go up, and that will have an incrementally worse impact on severity? Is that what\u2019s being embedded in sort of your base case right now?\nTricia Griffith: Not necessarily. In fact, we have seen a small amount of data that says they are leveling off and maybe even decreasing a little bit. Again, that\u2019s very early data. And there is a lot of economists that can \u2013 could talk either up or down. But no, that wouldn\u2019t be an assumption.\nAlex Scott: Okay. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.\nGary Ransom: Yes. Good morning. A few years back, you talked about a feature in your product that increased the rates automatically month-to-month. Is that a product that is still in use today? And if so, is the impact of that included in the 8% that you gave us for the full year rate increase?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I will start, and then, Pat, you can weigh in. We do have monthly rating factors, and they are baked into the rates you are seeing. Do you want to add anything else?\nPat Callahan: Sure. We don\u2019t have them in all jurisdictions. So, we would love to, but regulators don\u2019t approve it everywhere. So, I think we have it in roughly half of the country. And as you can expect, we don\u2019t tweak those trend factors as probably as sensitively or quickly as we might. So right now, I think it\u2019s at below what we are seeing with current net future trend. Now it helps because we are picking up every month additional rate without a filing in roughly half of our states, but it\u2019s not set to what we are seeing in this sort of super steep current trend environment, but it is helping. So yes, still on the products, still available, and our product managers are using it.\nJohn Sauerland: Well, I would add to Tricia\u2019s comment that December\u2019s take rate for Snapshot were the highest we\u2019ve seen ever. So yes, there were some influence from the pandemic on take rate there. But I think overall, there has been a growing acceptability in usage-based as a rating variable for auto insurance. And I think our December take rate in both channels, as Tricia mentioned, are indicative of that. So, we also obviously see competitors continuing to grow there, their UBI programs as well, which I think in aggregate enhances acceptability perceptions as well. So, we think that is definitely part of our future and even more so as the technology and vehicles allows us to get that new business. I was mentioning our ability to do that in the commercial space. And we have very limited ability to do that in the personal auto space, but we are doing it with data right from vehicles, but it\u2019s a small percentage of what we do. So, I think I would characterize take rate as continuing to grow. And with technology evolving, it\u2019s going to be an integral part of the product going forward.\nTricia Griffith: And it\u2019s a great way for our customers that they do see increases and they believe they are driving less to be able to get some discounts.\nGary Ransom: Right. Can I clarify the 10% and 40% numbers that you gave, that\u2019s 10% of new business apps in agency were Snapshot and 40% in direct were Snapshot, is that what you meant?\nTricia Griffith: Correct.\nGary Ransom: Correct. Okay. Thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Gary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Two, hopefully, really quick questions. First, there was a fair amount of exit today on the six-month policies as being away from pointing changes faster and earning them faster. The proportion of 12-month policies have been going up at least in agency. And I was wondering whether we should expect an effort to maybe convince some of those drivers to move to six-month policies.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. It\u2019s still a small percentage. It\u2019s less than 10% of our overall auto book. It\u2019s in the agency channel. Basically, we gave it to our 4,100 Platinum agents because many people, when they do want to bundle want to have the dates align. So, we will continue to watch that percentage, but it is something that, as we rolled out for our preferred customers for our Robinsons, it was something that our agents asked for in order to write more of that business.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then if I can go back to the cones on Slide 28. Obviously, I guess you have to select a point within there. Does the position of the point within the cone depend on the volatility of the input?\nJohn Sauerland: I can try that. This is simply an illustrative way to say we are not totally sure where the value of used cars is going. It\u2019s obviously been going up dramatically. As Tricia noted, we have seen some recent signs that it might be leveling off. We are certainly not pricing in our indications to anywhere towards the top of that cone. I would characterize our pricing assumptions more so towards the middle of the cone. But the reality is we \u2013 only time will tell where we ultimately fall in those cones. And that\u2019s the challenge of our business, and that\u2019s the point we are trying to get across in John and Kanik\u2019s presentation. And when we are trying to price for the future. The future is unknown, but we are not pricing towards the top of that. I would characterize our pricing assumptions as \u2013 towards the middle of that cone.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Meyer, our hope is, obviously, like John said, it was illustrative. But our hope is that as we have more data and as things stabilize, that cone narrows as well.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you.\nDoug Constantine: We have exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event. Janet, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Curtiss",
            "content": "Thanks, Tricia. Today, Kanik and I will give an update on the rate-making process in our Personal Auto business. We have structured our discussion in a Q&A format based upon common questions we receive from our investors. There are many facets to managing rate level in our Personal Auto business. And today, we are going to focus on two key aspects. First, we will share how we determine our rate need to support our operational goal to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. This can broadly be categorized into two areas: segment level and aggregate level. Segment level pricing is largely the responsibility of our product R&D group. While very important, we are not going to discuss this in detail today. You might remember that Pat Callahan and Sanjay Vyas discussed our approach to product segmentation back in our third quarter 2018 Investor Relations call. Today, we are going to focus on aggregate rate level, ensuring we are collecting enough premium in total to cover our expected future loss costs and expenses to achieve our 96 combined ratio goal. We will provide an overview on two key aspects of how we do this. The first topic that I will cover is the role of our auto pricing team who is responsible for the pricing indication process and providing product managers with an accurate estimate of rate need to ensure they hit rate revision profit targets. The second topic that Kanik will cover is how our product managers leverage these pricing indications, their broader toolkit, and local knowledge and expertise to set the pricing strategy for their respective states to ensure they hit not only rate revision targets, but also our calendar year goals. We will close the presentation with an overview of our deployment capabilities. In our Personal Auto business, it is very common for us to do hundreds of rate revisions per year, which involves many groups at Progressive. This is an area we have invested significantly in over the years to ensure we have industry-leading speed to market and the agility to adapt our resources to meet the dynamic needs of the marketplace. So, let's start with the first topic on how pricing and product management work together to determine our aggregate rate need. Before I go into details on our pricing tools, I will introduce six key concepts that we will be covering today. The first is compliance. Our product and rates need to comply with all state regulations, which can vary in each jurisdiction and often include limitations in our ability to use specific variables to rate policies. The second is that we price to cost. Our primary goal is to match the rate we charge with the expected cost to ensure our customers. To determine our aggregate rate need, we need to consider loss and loss adjustment expenses, operating and acquisition costs and our profit load. Third, insurance pricing is prospective. Insurance is unique as we do not know our cost of goods sold when we write a policy. As a result, we need to estimate future losses and expenses and ensure we charge enough premium to cover these and earn our profit load. Fourth, our rates need to comply with actuarial standards. The three primary considerations are to ensure rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And for clarity, when I say unfairly discriminatory, I mean not tied to underlying loss costs. Fifth, when managing our business, product managers need to consider both accident year and calendar year results. Our pricing decisions are based on accident year data, which is determined by the actual timing of a loss or accident as our product offering provides coverage for accidents we expect to occur during our rate revision. Our calendar year results consist of all the losses and premiums for the year, which include the current accident year plus any runoff from prior accident years. Finally, we will discuss our premium earnings convention. Unfortunately, we can't change rates on our entire book of business overnight. Rather, rate changes start earning in when a rate revision goes live either upon filing or after approval by Department of Insurance and that depends on the state. While new customers see the rate changes immediately, existing policyholders' rates will change at their next renewal event. As a result, it takes time for rate changes to earn in. Fortunately, Progressive writes mostly 6-month policies, which allows us to earn rates faster than many competitors who issue a higher mix of annual policies. Let me start with the auto pricing group. Pricing's goal is to deliver best-in-class tools to enable product managers to make risk-based decisions and to provide an accurate view of rate adequacy for our auto business. Think of this as the science behind the ratemaking. Given our beginnings as a non-standard writer and evolution to become a leader in segmentation and product innovation, we have honed our pricing sophistication for nearly 85 years. We continue to invest in attracting and retaining high-quality talent, building systems and processes to make sure we can accurately price a very complex product in a high-quality manner and advancing the science of pricing to improve our assessments of rate adequacy. The pricing indication is the key tool we use to determine our indicated rate need. It helps product managers answer the question how much do I need to raise or lower rates in my next rate revision to achieve the target combined ratio or better on an accident year basis. The indication is based upon two primary loss ratio calculations. The numerator is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we expect for policies that we will write in the upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. The denominator is the target loss ratio. This is the loss ratio we need to achieve to have enough premium left over to cover our prospective non-loss costs and profit load. The difference between these two ratios is the indicated rate need for the next revision. Let me provide more detail on how we determine the target loss ratio. Our goal is to price policies in a way that we will collect enough premium to cover our expected loss costs, loss adjustment expense, operating and acquisition costs, and have enough left over to hit our 4% profit margin. The chart on the slide depicts the various components to determine this loss ratio. And in this example, as you can see, our target loss ratio is 66%. It's very important to note that changes in our non-indemnity cost structure can result in changes in our target loss ratio and thus having a low cost structure is very important. All else equal, if expenses are lower, our target loss ratio will be higher and we can charge customers less for the same protection. The other key input into our indication is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we would expect for policies we are going to write in an upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. As I said earlier, we do not know what our loss cost will be when we write policies. And given our 4% profit target, we need to be very accurate in our projection. So, how do we get there? This requires us to adjust our historical accident year losses and premiums to reflect our best estimates of the future. Let me talk a little bit about the adjustments we make to our losses first. The first consideration is loss development, which is the process of estimating the ultimate frequency and severity of our claims. Since rate-making is prospective, we need to know how much will recent claims change from what we know about them today. We also need to know how many more claims will be reported from this time period and how much they will cost and change over time. To develop our historical frequency and severity, we analyzed historical development patterns using a variety of methodologies to help us achieve accurate estimates. Second, we also need to adjust for weather, which can be highly volatile over time. Our goal here is to price to a longer term average to make sure that we are not over or under-reacting to recent weather events. Once losses are fully developed, both frequency and severity are trended to the midpoint of the rate revision period. The midpoint represents the average cost of goods sold of losses during the revision. There are many factors that can impact our loss trends from macroeconomic variables such as inflation and gas prices to improve safety technology, to law changes and even our mix of business. We monitor these to understand where frequency and severity maybe headed and we update our trends on a monthly basis. On the premium side, we make two important adjustments. First, we adjust historical premium levels and bring them to current rate level to reflect our most recent pricing. Second, premiums also have trends, which are largely a function of changes in our mix of business. We need to account for the fact that our premiums can change due to the segments we write. We do not want to change rates simply because our mix of business changes over time. Our indications contain many inputs to help us project the future. And as a result, there is pricing risk. Let me share a few examples of the strategies we employ to manage this. First, when possible, we would like to rely on the most recent accident periods, which allow us to be responsive to our most recent experience and limits the trending period. Here, our data scale is a big asset as it affords us increased precision and prevents us from reacting to noise. The second is our high frequency of rate revision. This allows us to price to a shorter rate revision length and to be more responsive to changes in our indications. You have probably heard us say that we take smaller and more frequent bites at the apple. As a result, it is common for product managers to complete multiple revisions in a year. This is true in general, but not always as we are currently taking much larger bites in the current rapidly escalating loss cost environment to ensure rate adequacy. The third is our high mix of 6-month policies. As I mentioned earlier, once a rate revision goes live, it takes time to earn into the book, because we need to wait for policies to renew into the new rate level. As you would expect, 6-month policies earn in roughly twice as fast as annual policies. Our high mix of 6-month policies dramatically increases the speed with which new rates earn into our results. As you can imagine, COVID was a massive shock to our business and has forced us to adapt our pricing indications in multiple ways. Today, I am going to use collision coverage as a quick case study to highlight the impact on our loss trends and to share our responses. This slide contains a time series view of our collision coverage frequency, severity and pure premium through the end of 2019. It represents a pre-COVID period. The solid line is monthly data. You will notice that this data can be bumpy, which is largely due to seasonality. The dotted lines represent the trailing 12-month average. As you can see, during this time, our trends are relatively stable. Pure premiums were increasing on average by slightly more than 3% per year, with frequency gradually decreasing and severity growing faster than the rate of inflation. During this time, we were tracking a variety of variables that could help inform where we thought trends might be headed in the future. One thing we did not expect was once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. On this slide, the data has been updated through April 2020 to reflect the onset of COVID. As you are aware, a massive decrease in driving significantly reduced our collision frequency. This also dramatically changed our data and challenged us to think of new ways to project trends. The key question we needed to answer was how quickly will frequency rebound? To help us answer this question, we leveraged a variety of data elements to inform future projections of frequency. This data came from a variety of sources. First, we closely monitor our claims frequency data to understand both monthly changes and comparisons to pre-COVID levels. Second, we leveraged our extensive snapshot data, which we know is highly correlated with frequency. This data provides a daily view of vehicle miles traveled and important segment level data on driving patterns such as time of day and day of week. Third, we utilized input from product managers who brought local knowledge about changes to driving in their respective states. By analyzing this data over time, we could start to quantify with what likelihood, by how much and when frequency might return to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is conducted at a state, channel and coverage level and we update it very frequently. This slide shows the same three graphs through the end of 2021. As you can see, our collision pure premiums have rapidly accelerated to well above historic levels. While frequency has rebounded, it is still below where it was prior to the pandemic. However, collision severity has dramatically increased driven by supply chain disruptions and the soaring prices of used cars. Like frequency, our response for severity has been to leverage new data sources like the Manheim Index to explain the causes of these increases and where they might be headed in the future. In collision, more than half of our lost dollars are from total losses as we pay to replace total vehicles damaged beyond net cash value. This plot is showing the average value of used cars from Manheim in orange and the estimate of actual cash value, or ACV, of the vehicles we write estimates on in blue. Not surprisingly, what we see is a very strong correlation between these two metrics with ACV lagging in Manheim by a few months. Given this, signals of upward movement in car values are a leading indicator of ACV estimates and severity. With this data, we are better able to evaluate scenarios of where severity maybe headed in the future, with the cones representing the fact that there is still a high level of uncertainty. Given there is a high level of uncertainty of where our trends and therefore, our rate need might be headed, I want to share with you how we ensure we are getting our latest views of rate adequacy to product managers in a timely manner. As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to frequently update our trend analysis and pricing indications so that product managers can quickly respond to changing market conditions. Our indications are updated quarterly for each state, channel and coverage combination, which generates thousands of pricing recommendations per year. As I mentioned earlier, we updated our loss trends and premium trends on a monthly basis. Given the rapidly changing trend environment due to COVID, we are now able to update the trend portion of our indications monthly, which provides product managers even more up-to-date data on changes to their rate indications. This allows product managers to adjust their plans as the needs of their business change. And now, I will hand the presentation over to Kanik who will provide an update on how product managers leverage our pricing science to deliver our operational goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a 96 combined ratio."

            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, 2021 was a year like no other. We were forced to confront the new normal imposed on us by the pandemic. We faced business challenges unlike those we have ever previously seen, all while continuing to serve our customers at the level they have come to expect from Progressive. Our people are flexible. They can see the challenges coming and react appropriately to ensure we meet our business objectives. Our ability to respond like this is supported by our corporate culture, which is built on our four cornerstones: who we are which is based on our five core values; why we are here, which is our purpose; where we are headed, which is our vision; and how we will get there, which is our strategy. This construct guides us so we are all headed in the same direction regardless of the bumps in the road. To achieve our vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto home and other insurance, we need to execute on our four strategic pillars. In our quarter two call, I spoke in detail about our pillars and their importance to our business and I continued that discussion in my annual letter to shareholders. While each pillar is equally important to support our strategy, today, we are going to focus on a single pillar, competitive pricing. Competitive pricing does not mean having the lowest rate all the time, although we strive to do that as much as possible. Rather, it means having the correct rate to match the risk we are trying to ensure, while at the same time, delivering more value to the customer. We believe that if we could outsegment our competition, settle claims accurately and manage expenses appropriately, providing attractive rates to our customers will come naturally. It's no secret that the insurance industry is going through a period of immense change brought on by catastrophic weather events and macroeconomic headwinds. Our business is no exception. The changes in Personal Lines results, which is our largest line of business, were especially pronounced. Personal Lines results continued to benefit in the first quarter of the year by lower frequency brought on by the pandemic. However, the last three quarters delivered challenges. Frequency started to rise, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. While the increase in frequency did not surprise us as people started driving more, what was a bit of surprise were the increases in severity, especially the cost to repair and replace vehicles. It was these rising trends that forced us to increase rates. Once we realize these developments were not temporary, our product managers acted quickly, and in the second quarter, started taking Personal Auto rate increases, which were in advance of many in the industry. We have continued to increase rates through the fourth quarter with a total of 8% taken in calendar year 2021. In addition to rate changes, we also had to make some difficult decisions to reduce expenses and increase underwriting scrutiny to hit our profitability goal of a 96 combined ratio, which is the expected impact of reducing growth. While these decisions are tough to make and the short-term results can be difficult to acknowledge, we believe we have built a better mousetrap. History has shown that following times of industry disruption, we have grown our Personal Lines business faster than our competitors with better profitability. Further, it has been after times like this that we have made some of our greatest strides to achieving our vision. Today, we will spend some time talking about the mousetrap that allows us to react faster and we believe more accurately than the industry as a whole. Our first topic today will be on the science of Personal Auto pricing. We will discuss how we take massive amounts of incoming data and apply tools to make risk-based decisions and provide an accurate view of rate adequacy. John Curtiss, our National Product Development Leader, will be presenting this topic. John currently leads our Personal Auto product R&D and pricing groups and has held numerous roles throughout his 19-year career with Progressive. Next, on the agenda is Kanik Varma, who will demonstrate the real-world execution of the science used by our product managers. Kanik has been with Progressive for over 20 years and was recently appointed as the General Manager of the West region. Kanik currently leads a team of about 12 product managers and draws on many years of direct product management experience to lead the team. Kanik will wrap up the presentation by talking about Progressive's deployment capabilities. Following the presentations, we will of course have our Q&A session. Again, thank you for joining this morning. I will now hand it over to John Curtiss. John? Thanks, Elyse. And I think that's very dependent on each state. So we feel good where we're at now. So we took the 8 points last year, took another 3 points in Personal Auto in January. And we've had some successes with some of the regulators. So let me give you an example. In Texas \u2013 I think that came up in the last call. We \u2013 they had some objections. We went back and forth with a lot of data, came to an agreement earlier this month, and both of those prior \u2013 those approvals are done and effective, I think, on the 24th. And then we've put another rate increase in February. So we feel good about states like Texas where we've had great conversations with our regulators, and we can get the rates on the street. And that allows us to open up local advertising, our bill plans that we might have restricted underwriting guidelines and \u2013 our underwriting restrictions, I should say. And so it's a mixed bag depending on each state. So we will continue to watch the trends. The trends in used cars and new cars still continue to actually outpace even pre-COVID levels. And of course, a lot depends on frequency. So we saw vehicle miles traveled down more in January. We think that might have been through Omicron. So they were down about 11% to 14% compared to our percentage of about 7% to 8% since May. Now that we're seeing more states open, we will watch frequency closely. So we're watching companies open. And what the new normal is of how people go back to work, I think, is yet to be determined. I know with Progressive, we are just figuring that out as well. There'll be a lot more people that work from home or work from home part of the time. So we're going to watch frequency once things stabilize a little bit more. So the real answer is we don't know for sure. But hopefully, John and Kanik let you understand that the propensity to have the majority of our auto policy 6 months allow us that flexibility to get the rate in more quickly. I think that's probably part of it. I think there is a lot of seasonality in January. So I wouldn't read into that too much because we still have a lot of that rate to earn in. What I would say, early results from February from vehicle miles traveled, they are going back to what we saw before January. So we could see frequency go up a little bit. Again, that's yet to be determined, and we will have those results in a few weeks. Thanks, Elyse. Well, when we kind of strip away at the Q4 results from some of our competitor, we feel like we're in a pretty good company. It looks like almost everybody needs a similar rate than we do. So we're monitoring that. I mean as far as our book of non-standard, of course, that's \u2013 that was our humble beginnings, but we are \u2013 we continue to grow more on the preferred side. When you think about new business, our apps are down more on the Sams, which makes total sense because they are very sensitive to price. We define them as inconsistently insured. And of course, a lot of the PIF growth on the Sam side comes from the new apps because their PLEs are really short. So I wouldn't say \u2013 I would say I think everybody in these rates. The trends changed as you saw dramatically. And so I feel like we're in a really good position. We continue to work with regulators where we don't have the right rates on the Street yet to prove that out. And if we need to, we will slow growth for a bit until we get there. Mike, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty, but I think you hit the nail on the head. So we've got the supply-demand issues with chips. So we have parts prices continue to increase. Because it's taking longer to repair those, our rental prices have gone up. We're watching labor rates in body shops closely and working with our MSOs to understand what we think about that. But when you think about severity, we look at it in a couple of different ways, but I've been focusing on looking at it from this last quarter, quarter four of 2021 compared to \u201819. And let's take collision as an example, and we don't usually share at this level. But in the aggregate, we are up in severity about 11.9%. Collisions, up substantially more than that. And actually, frequency is down less than pre-COVID, and severity is up. So we're watching very specific line coverages to understand the trends and how they relate to the increases that we need specifically. Thanks, Mike. Yes. I mean we continue to work with regulators in California. It can be a challenge, and we're up for the challenge. We \u2013 how they might look at rates versus we are looking at them prospectively, I think, is a little bit different. And so we're sharing data regarding what we're seeing and the trends we need. Here's the bottom line for any regulators. They should demand adequate rates. And we need to get adequate rates on the street in California in every jurisdiction for that matter. So we're going to continue to work with California. And there is a handful of other states where we continue to go back and forth. And our goal is to be open and available for all consumers. And if we're open and available, that helps with affordability in the long run. So in the meantime, we have some levers that we can use to slow down growth, whether it's local advertising or build plans, underwriting restrictions and some agents incentives, we will do that in the states where we need rate. We do need rate in California, but we will continue to work with the regulators there to prove our case. Yes. There is a lot of variables like that. Some you hit the nail on the head with 12 months, some are not increasing at the rate we are. We are usually first to market, and we talk about that a lot in order to get ahead of trends. We do see competitors definitely taking rates. And so we knew taking action aggressively early on when we saw the trends changed so dramatically. We knew that would affect our new business apps. We're seeing that, but we feel good about getting those rates on the Street. And as more and more companies see those rates, the competitive environment will improve. And hopefully, as people shop, they'll come to us and we will be in a good position to have stable rates. So it's really across the board. Some are taking a different approach because they have 12-month policies, some run their companies differently than we do. We have a very specific goal to make that $0.04 of underwriting profit. And so that is our primary goal and growth a second. So we will continue to watch. We believe that we feel like we're in a good position for the most part. Thank you. It's very dependent on each state. So there are some states where there is more needed. I gave you the example of Texas where we had two rate revisions and we put another one in play, a double-digit one in February. So I think it's very dependent on the jurisdiction. I would say when we define small bites, it's nice for consumers to have stable rates. So small bites to me, and I don't think there is any great definition, is 1% here, 1% there. So I never like to take 6.8% or ever double-digit percentage because we see then that, one, it affects our new business and could ultimately affect our renewal business as people get increases. So that, to me, is a larger bite. But again, we saw these dramatic trends, and we needed to get out in front of it. Yes. So we will plan to spend as much as we can on marketing as long as we feel like rates are \u2013 the rates we have out there are appropriate as well as the fact that our acquisition costs go within our target \u2013 we want to have our targeted acquisition cost. So what the levers that we will use in places where we don't think we have the rate just yet will be to turn off or slow down local advertising. We have some great plans around marketing. Again, we will \u2013 that will be dependent on each jurisdiction and where we feel we are as far as rate adequacy. Yes. Well, I think of the new business penalty, for me, more on the direct side in terms of front-loading our acquisition costs in the first 6 months of the policy. As far as the projected loss ratio, I mean, I'm not \u2013 I'm hoping to answer your question. I mean I think that our new business, obviously, is negative right now in, I think, every single segment. We saw it initially in the agency business. I think they are very susceptible to any price increases based on the fact that they have a lot of opportunity to put business with their customers with others. I'm not sure if I answered your question or if you want to add anything. Yes. Absolutely. We feel incredibly proud of our results, both on the growth and profit over the last couple of years. One of the biggest areas in Commercial Lines where we've been able to grow is in our for-hire transportation segment, which makes a lot of sense. During COVID, goods need to be transferred across the country. Many of us stopped shopping and ordered. And so we really we're in a great position to improve and increase our market share in that specific segment. We've been writing that for a lot of years. So the good news is we knew the underlying cost structure. We were conservative in our take rate. So we feel really good about that. Obviously, there is a couple of other things. We continue to grow in our TNC business. We added Protective as another part of our fleet. And across the board, we feel pretty good about growth \u2013 really good about growth in all of our BMTs. So just a really great part of the story where we saw an opportunity, we had the background and experience to write a lot more of that, and we took advantage of it. Yes. Our BOP program is now in 34 states. We added 17 this year. So, obviously still small, but something, as I outlined, probably last year, a few years ago, our different horizons, we are excited about helping ensure those small businesses. So, that's something that we think there is a lot of runway. Thanks Greg. Well, it's a multifaceted question. I would say, normally, we do spend a fair amount in the first half of any year, but we did dramatically reduce spend because of our profitability issues at the end of 2021. So, we wouldn't have normally reduced it by that much. We did that as a reactive position based on what we saw with trend. And so we spend depending on when we believe that people are open to shopping, and that can vary. So, we did spend more in January of this year. I don't know if Pat, do you want to add anything more to what we are feeling about from a media perspective. Thank you, Josh. Yes. I mean I think we like to bundle, but we also want to make sure that we are positioned well for the long-term growth in the property channel. And we have continued to increase our Robinsons. We are proud of that. We want to do that \u2013 we just want to do it in \u2013 spread across more non-volatile weather states, so that we can make our target margin on those bundled customers. So, will we lose some customers from some of the de-risking decisions we are making in Florida on the auto side, likely, that might happen. We will wait to see how that happens. And of course, that also depends on what's happening in the environment. So, when people shop, are they getting the same or better rate if they go to another competitor. So a lot of that, specifically in Florida, will be dependent on what the competitors do as well. So, I think people that want to bundle, you may take both your auto and home with you. We will work on trying to keep as much of the auto book of the property that we lose. But that's yet to be known as we continue our plan to de-risk. Yes. And I should do a shout-out because we have really invested a lot over the years in HomeQuote Explorer, where you can \u2013 we can go online, and now we have 34 states where you can have an online buy, which makes it just easier for consumers as well if they are shopping. So, they may have auto with Progressive, and the home could be with Progressive property, but then they could switch over to another one of our unaffiliated partners. So, John is right on point. Yes. The severity on commercial is up. When you look at the trailing 12 over the prior 12, up right around just under 14%, and frequency has come back to pre-COVID levels for the most part. We see a lot with our \u2013 as John said, we have our telematics on the commercial auto side. We see that speeding for some of our truckers are up about 10% to 20%. And we see that sort of correlated when there is more congestion out versus less congestion. So yes, those are higher limit policies. Obviously, we have talked in the past about social inflation around more attorney rep claims. So, we are seeing an increase in those trends in the commercial lines product as well. Thank you. Yes. I would say a portion of it, I said \u2013 I wouldn't take one month, like you said, for much. I think expenses are usually up in January regardless, and a portion of it was media, but not a huge amount. Yes. A lot of it in \u2013 at least in Q4 would be around attorney rep rate, and so a lot of the medical inflation. We also, as we have been hiring on new claims reps, that \u2013 the propensity to how the handling is done and the accuracy can be a little bit different as those claims reps get trained. And so that was probably a part of it as well. So, that's what we are seeing in quarter four. But a lot of the inflation is around attorney rep rate. And it will be interesting to see as more and more treatment facilities open up if that changes as well. So, we will watch that closely. Yes. I think just used car parts similar to collision, but you might see it a little bit of a delay. But used car prices, parts prices, rental car increases, all those things are coming into play as well. We just think that it's good to look at, especially \u2013 I even think not even just year-over-year when we compare to \u201819. We obviously have that data. But there is so much changing right now that I am really looking at quarter-over-quarter comparison. So, that's where we are at on physical damage. We believe we will see similar trends continue to emerge from \u2013 similar the collision. Well, yes, there is a little bit of a delay in recognizing that. I think on \u2013 I think we see that from our competitors as well. We see that in our subrogation files of getting some of the data in from other companies in inbound sub, so a little bit of a delay, yes. I had mentioned that overall severity was up comparing \u201819 quarter four to \u201820 \u2013 to \u201821 quarter four at about 11.9 property damages. I said collision was up significantly from severity. Property damage is up as well, not as significant as collision, but it is higher than the 11.9. Yes. I mean I think that we are all watching vehicle miles traveled and frequency closely. And it's not back to pre-COVID amounts. That said, severity is so far outpacing that from all the things we talked about. Whether it's medical inflation, car price, rental cars, et cetera, that we need rate and I have said this in the last call. And so there is \u2013 each individual like John and Kanik said, there is 51 jurisdictions we work with to try to make sure that our rates are adequate and not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. I do believe that regulators care a lot about their constituents. And so they want to be very careful as they increase the cost because there is other inflationary things that are happening in each household. So I can't get into the psychology of it because we are just such a data-driven company that \u2013 that's what we look at. And so we will continue to do so. And our hope is that we get a handful of states where we still need rate. We get that in short order. So, we can be open and available and affordable for every constituent in the entire United States. Absolutely. Yes. That's the fun part of working in a regulated industry because there is a lot of different personalities of each state. And we \u2013 and that product management relationship that we talked about is so integral to that success. And so we actually think that's a great advantage. And yes, each state is very different. Great question, difficult to answer. Like we said, we look at each state, and we were able to turn on local advertising \u2013 turn on and off local advertising pretty quickly. So, I mean as soon as we believe we have the rates right and that we can turn on media to get more new business at our allowable cost, we will do so. But it's really dependent on each state. We want to do that. We want to open up each lever to do that, but it really is dependent on getting not just in the states that we just talked about, but in every state to make sure we continue to stay ahead of trend. Yes. We still are seeing new business shrink, and that makes sense with our pricing. And from the renewal perspective, I think we talked about in the K that trailing three was dropping a little bit. And so it's reasonable to believe that trailing 12 could drop as well. But again, that's all dependent on what our competitors do as well. When we look at elasticity, it's not just what's happening here. It's what the competitors are doing. And we look at our renewal rates in sort of tranches of if we take plus 5%, 5% to 10%, etcetera, to see what happens. And we are seeing some \u2013 we believe some improvements from slowing down in some of the tranches where our competitors are taking rate. And that could mean we \u2013 there is a lot of variables here, that could mean that they are taking rates as well. So, when our customers get an increase in their renewal rate and they shop, they might stay because they can't get a better rate. Again, we are not seeing that play through yet in the trailing 12. The trailing three can be an indicator. And that's why we want to get out ahead of this to sort of get the rates stable as quickly as possible in 2022, so we can all focus on doing our job as an industry and be really competitive, drive down those costs so people have affordable ways to buy insurance. It's so hard to say because there are so many moving parts constantly. So, where we would think, okay, we come into February, the weather is going to be nicer, places are opening up, but then you have the invasion of Ukraine. So, what happens with fuel prices, although that's usually a small part of our frequency trend. We \u2013 I would say, if you have a couple of quarters of some stability in seeing what's happening as an example, to see if used car prices and the chip shortage starts to ease up, we would start to follow that and feel better about that. But we \u2013 our math, we believe, is accurate of what we need now, and that's really what we focus on in order to make sure that we ultimately have that lifetime value of that profitable growth of the 96. Not necessarily. In fact, we have seen a small amount of data that says they are leveling off and maybe even decreasing a little bit. Again, that's very early data. And there is a lot of economists that can \u2013 could talk either up or down. But no, that wouldn't be an assumption. Thank you. Yes. I will start, and then, Pat, you can weigh in. We do have monthly rating factors, and they are baked into the rates you are seeing. Do you want to add anything else? And it's a great way for our customers that they do see increases and they believe they are driving less to be able to get some discounts. Correct. Thanks Gary. Yes. It's still a small percentage. It's less than 10% of our overall auto book. It's in the agency channel. Basically, we gave it to our 4,100 Platinum agents because many people, when they do want to bundle want to have the dates align. So, we will continue to watch that percentage, but it is something that, as we rolled out for our preferred customers for our Robinsons, it was something that our agents asked for in order to write more of that business. Yes. Meyer, our hope is, obviously, like John said, it was illustrative. But our hope is that as we have more data and as things stabilize, that cone narrows as well."

            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "No, I think your response on the seasonality of ad spend is absolutely right. We spend when that will be efficient, media spend, and frankly, when we think we are priced adequately for the new business coming in. So, once \u2013 as Kanik and John laid out, severity started to take off with frequency in the second half of last year. We had some rational pullback there just simply because we weren't comfortable with our rate level. Now, when we come into this year, as Tricia mentioned, we typically will spend more in Q1 ahead of what's typical shopping season. And that's what we saw in January, but it is more state-specific where we are open for business and turning on some media spend. Now, on a year-over-year basis, we had our best quarter ever in Q1 of 2021. So, from a spend and an efficiency perspective, we have got some tough comps coming ahead of us at this point in time. But really, our full year spend is 12 individual months of spend, highly controllable, on and off as we are comfortable with the efficiency of the spend and frankly, the adequacy of the underlying business we bring in for that spend. Sure. We don't have them in all jurisdictions. So, we would love to, but regulators don't approve it everywhere. So, I think we have it in roughly half of the country. And as you can expect, we don't tweak those trend factors as probably as sensitively or quickly as we might. So right now, I think it's at below what we are seeing with current net future trend. Now it helps because we are picking up every month additional rate without a filing in roughly half of our states, but it's not set to what we are seeing in this sort of super steep current trend environment, but it is helping. So yes, still on the products, still available, and our product managers are using it."

            "content": "Thanks, John. The goal of the product management organization is to deliver profitable growth at our target margin through adapting Progressive's products to win in our local markets. This organization comprises of highly talented individuals. They are results oriented and were attracted by profit and loss ownership. They want accountability and decision rights and we empower them to make decisions at the local level. Think of them as Chief Operating Officers of their own businesses. There are several aspects to our Product Manager's job at Progressive. Each product, state, channel is different and our Product Manager's design strategies to meet our goals within the individual businesses. Compliance is mandatory. Profit is our second priority. Growth at target margins comes next. Managing legislative, regulatory developments and relationships are key levers in order to respond to economic conditions and the competitive environment within their states. Today, I am going to focus on one aspect of their role, tactics to deliver our target margins. And this is especially relevant in the current environment. The first step in consistently hitting our target margins is to give our product managers very clear operational goals. You know it as our grow as fast as you can at a 96 objective. Just a reminder, that's a composite calendar year target number. Product Managers manage to their respective targets within their channel product or geography down to the line coverage level. Each business fulfills their role within the overall portfolio to meet this composite goal. Our product managers have multiple tools that help us operationalize this goal. We call it the product manager toolkit. Product managers actively monitor results with daily reporting on volume measures and monthly data across all other KPIs. The toolkit affords both diagnostics and informs actions to ensure we deliver segment level results that roll up to our aggregate objectives. At the macro aggregate level, operationalizing this objective is like riding a wave. It requires a very delicate balance, go do fast with rate and you will be ahead of the market in compromise growth. However, if you move too slowly and fall behind on rate, it's incredibly hard to catch back up and you will miss profitability targets. Product managers continuously adjust rate level to match changing conditions and the capability to be nimble is a source of competitive advantage for Progressive. Our product managers are not just trying to hit 96 at the macro level, but are making sure they are pricing each individual segment the same target margins. That's very important. We don't have a bias towards any specific customer segment. We want to drive growth across the spectrum, provided those risks of price accurately. This approach enables us to deliver on our broad acceptance or what we call take nearly all comers philosophy. Our heritage starting out writing less preferred customers required us to align our entire business around matching rate to risk. And as we have expanded our aperture over the past decades, this approach remains foundational to our strategy. We have to make sure we are continuously matching rate to risk. Our scale provides us credible data and to make data-driven decisions at the micro level, which is a competitive advantage versus many industry competitors. Product upgrades in each state allow us to add new rating wearables to our algorithms that feeds the virtuous cycle of risk selection. We have talked about this at length in the past. So today, I will just focus on how product managers manage profitability at the macro level. The aggregate rate level is determined for each state and channel. Each product manager decides how much rate to take and how often to take that rate for the state and channel they manage. This decision-making relies very heavily on the advanced analytics John talked about earlier. Product managers also incorporate multiple local inputs into their decisions. I'd like to group these local inputs into three broad categories: state-specific loss trends; regulatory framework within the state; the mix of business we ensure in each state as that drives the earnings cadence. Let's walk through each one of these one-by-one. The first category of inputs is state-specific loss trends. Each state is unique and states have different loss trends at any given point of time. There are many reasons for this in the auto product. Coverages and limits offered are based on unique state laws. State laws change often and have a direct effect on loss costs going forward. Example of this would be injury limit increases, fee schedule changes and new case law. States have unique weather patterns that impact loss costs. For example, hill states differ from hurricane states and we use different weather loads in these states. Claims processes are different by state and we keep improving them to make sure we are paying accurately. Process changes like labor rate changes, litigation and fraud mitigation strategies can have an impact on loss costs and LAE. These are all different by state. And during the COVID pandemic, states had different lockdown and reopening laws. Product managers work closely with our cross-functional partners in their states. These partners provide valuable local market input and we incorporate those into our decisions. The second input that impacts decision-making at the state level is rate regulations. At a very basic level, there are two types of rate regulation mechanisms, file and use in prior approval. In file and use states, we could elevate rate changes literally the day after we file. Though approval for the revision in these states can come months and in some cases years after the rates are effective. Prior approval means a state DOI needs to approve their revision before its effective. This framework requires more time to get rates to the street. But even before approval and prior approval states, we typically go through a back and forth with regulators as they ask questions and we explain our data and answer that questions about what's changing with the specific revision. We call this the objection process. But don't be confused, these are questions raised to clarify and understand and not fix barriers to implementing our product changes. Over decades, we have built incredibly strong relationships with our regulators as both credible and transparent operators and we continue to work closely with regulators to ensure they are comfortable with what we are doing, why we are doing it and how, what we are doing ensures we deliver rates that are adequate, are not excessive, and are not unfairly discriminatory. When trends changes, usually with a first carrier to share the latest credible data with state regulators. So it's fairly normal for them to react to new information and ask questions and ask for support to confirm understanding. In practice though, there are 51 different enforcement mechanisms, no two are alike. Each has to be managed independently. We have built the institutional knowledge and dedicated resources to put together filings and additional support, to ensure we get the right price into every local market as quickly as possible. Each product manager has in-depth understanding of the state's regulatory mechanism. They are on top of the unique deviations which means we have to know how to calculate rate need on the state's template, how much rate can be approved under a certain mechanism, the flex bands and how often we can file in a year. They also manage the approval timelines, which can vary based on the type of filing within each state. While we price our policies to run consistently at or below a 96 accident year combined ratio prospectively, we also manage our results to a calendar year 96 combined ratio target. In order to do that, product managers need to plan for the time it takes for rate changes to earn into our financials. It's important to note that because we have a large book of in-force business rate changes don't affect all policies at the same time. All new policies going forward are written on the new rates, but existing policies don't see a rating until they come up for renewal. Our combined ratio is a function of losses and expenses divided by earned premium. To put things into perspective, this is a chart of how much time it takes for that earned premium to reflect the new rates on our Personal Auto policies. With a predominantly 6-month book of business, if we increase rates by 5% today, 5 months from now, our earned premium, which is the denominator for the combined ratio, would have increased approximately 3.5%. And by month 7, we will be close to that 5%. So the rate we took in the second half of 2021, around 6%, will have largely earned into the financials by midyear. Any rate we will take now will partially offset the first half and, more materially, the second half's combined ratio. For comparison, if a carrier had 75% of their policies as annuals, it will take even longer as only 65% of the premium would be at the right rate level 7 months after the change. This is a big reason we've limited distribution of 12-month policies to primarily our Platinum agencies, while over 90% of our Personal Auto policies are 6-month policies. And at times like these, we benefit from a shorter lag period to realize rate changes in our book. Let's use one example to show you how one auto product manager made high-level decisions over the last couple of years. This is a real example from one medium-sized state. The gray line on the chart is monthly pure premium in that state, while the blue line is a trailing 12-month average pure premium. This takes out the weather-related seasonality in the state. In 2019, the state was running under a 96 combined ratio, and our loss cost trends were fairly stable in the state. With stable trends, the product manager was focused on growth strategies, which typically include lowering rates to convert more shoppers or increasing demand generation spend to generate more shoppers. As early COVID-related frequency drop came through our data, the product manager responded, first, by participating in our April relief efforts. That included $1 billion of premium credits during the immediate post-COVID period. That was followed by an aggregate rate level decrease a couple of months later. In early 2021, as this product manager was evaluating their aggregate rate level, based on the data available at the time, they expected trends to start returning to pre-COVID level at a fairly slow pace. The state's pure premium expectations at the time are shown in the orange line. At this point of time, our tools indicated no immediate rate action, nor did local conditions in the state weren't anything different. Our ability to review trends and rate level every month allow this product manager to very quickly spot a change in trend shortly after making their rate decision. This change in loss cost trend was supported by UBI data in the state, which you're driving returning at a faster pace than previously expected. There was enough credibility in the data for the product manager to react and the adjusted rate level upwards to reflect the change in frequency trend. As time went on, severity continued to rise at a faster pace than expected back in May, especially in collision comprehensive property damage coverages. Frequency also continued to see modest positive trend as driving behavior reverted back to normal. At this point, the product manager took another rate adjustment to ensure they would hit the accident year 96 and calendar year 96 combined ratio objectives. Since we're in the business of trying to predict the future, there is near certainty that we will be wrong. However, our business model is to minimize this error by shortening our future pricing time horizon to provide more frequent opportunities to adjust our future prices to market conditions. Our product managers have the advantage of getting updated indications and other diagnostics often and have the resources to act when needed. This allows us to react very quickly when conditions are changing and when the regulatory framework allows it. As Tricia shared, this approach of taking more frequent smaller bites of the apple continues to serve us well as our rates are more closely aligned with true underlying costs, which enables us to deliver more consistent underwriting profitability and more competitive rates that drive long-term growth. If a carrier either does not have the ability to review data often and/or does not have the flexibility to react quickly, you can fall behind on rate need. The margin of error grows the longer you have to wait to react. This is why we have invested heavily in the tools to evaluate trend quickly, and the systems to react as fast as possible. This chart also illustrates the challenge in states with longer approval times. Our product managers deploy different strategies to manage rate revision length risk in states where we aren't afforded the flexibility to change rates as often as necessary to accurately match rate to risk. Our product managers typically act earlier and more conservatively to ensure we have adequate rates while making sure they are not excessive. They also have a full toolkit of levers available to deploy, to protect the book and meet their target margins. We just talked about the science and the product manager toolkit. Now let's talk about how we deploy changes to the market. Having data and analytics to inform pricing decision-making is necessary, but not sufficient to effectively manage a book of business. You must also have decision makers and the deployment resources to file in a timely manner, get regulators comfortable with our actions and the IT infrastructure to get the updated pricing to market. In the example I shared, this particular product manager implemented 10 rate revisions in the state in the last 2 years alone, five each for direct and five for agency. These actions resulted in the state meeting its profit targets, both years in a very dynamic market and achieving 7.4% earned premium growth last year or over 25% earned premium growth over the 2-year period while continuing to keep us ahead of the industry on segmentation. The backbone of our deployment capabilities is our rate revision factory. We have the ability to act multiple times in a year in every state. Our resources dedicated for product upgrades are incremental to those for rate increases. Just to give you an idea. Last year, we deployed over four rate revisions per state in auto, and approximately 60% of our premium picked up the latest product model. It's also important to note, each tool in the product manager toolkit is supported with dedicated IT infrastructure. These are separate systems and resources that are incremental to our rate revision factory. That gives us added flexibility to deploy our tools as needed in individual states. We have long seen revision deployment and cadence as a potential source of competitive advantage, which is why several years ago, we invested in the factory to increase its throughput and improve its quality to ensure we can continue to lead in both pricing and segmentation. We believe this investment has provided us with best-in-class capabilities. And this is just a view of our auto product. Each business, commercial, recreational lines and property, have, incremental dedicated capabilities. Our ability to react early to changes in market conditions creates opportunities for us. The last time the market hardened, we followed our playbook and reacted fast and decisively. We believe faster response times help us compress the industry cyclicality during both hard and soft markets. That continues to drive our growth during times of change. This market cycle may be different in magnitude but requires a similar playbook. We reacted as soon as we saw trends turned in 2020 in addition to the $1 billion April relief effort. Trends changed direction in 2021, and we reacted immediately. We've had a head start, and we will continue to react quickly as we see changes in the results in either direction. While we can't know if this cycle will play out exactly like cycles of the past, we do continue to have trust in our process and believe it will help us deliver the best possible results. Thank you."

            "content": "I can add a little bit there. So there is really two objectives in pricing the business. One is the lifetime profitability of a customer and the other is hitting our calendar year targets, and we're trying to achieve both, and sometimes there is a balance there to be had. As Tricia was noting in the direct business, new business runs a lot hotter than renewals. So because of that advertising expense that we incur completely upfront, less so in the agency channel, but we also see differing new versus renewal loss ratio differences across segments of customers. So there is a bigger new business penalty when you're in the non-standard end of the spectrum relative to the preferred end of the spectrum. So we're trying to balance the lifetime profitability of those customers as well as the calendar year profitability of the entire business when we're making those decisions. As we were noting earlier, there are certainly markets right now where the underlying base rate level, if you will, is not adequate. And so those cases, we are restricting as much as we can because we're pretty confident that we're not going to hit our target margin on a lifetime basis for that business. There are other markets where we're closer, and that's where we're playing the underwriting, the advertising levers to manage that again to the calendar year, but also to the lifetime targets. I get excited talking about Commercial Lines, so I'll tack on here. We've got a number of other things going on there, I think, are not as appreciated in the market as perhaps they should be. So usage-based rating in Commercial is going really well. It's really predictive. Obviously, those trucks are driving a lot of miles. So the differential across those who are good drivers and those who are less good is pretty significant, and we're pricing to that. We also have that information for a large group of customers at new business because truckers now have electronic logging devices that have that information, and we can input that into the new business rate. Relative to the Personal side where predominantly, we're still using the information we gather at renewal versus new business. So Smart Haul is going really, really well. We also have a program we call Snapshot ProView that is also working well for smaller fleets. The other piece of Commercial that I think is pretty exciting is the direct channel. So we've all been sort of wondering when Commercial customers will sort of follow the Personal side and start shopping a bit more in the direct channel. COVID certainly, I think helped accelerate that and we are seeing great growth in our direct channel and commercial lines. I could go on into the BOP program as well. So, I think you are right to say, hey, it's a very exciting segment of the business right now, the core, what we call business market targets, the trucks, etcetera, are doing really well, and we have got a lot of long-term runway to play in commercial lines beyond that. So, we think of our non-acquisition spend as what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio, which generally you can think of as G&A expenses, the long-term trend there has been really good. So, we have taken out over the past, I don't know, probably decade maybe four points in our non-acquisition expense ratio. Obviously, that allows us to be really competitive. And our goal is to continue to reduce that number. So, we obviously have scale at our advantage. We obviously are investing heavily in technology to continue to get consumers to self-service and be happy doing so. So, a lot of efforts around continuing to be competitive in our cost structure outside of acquisition, we would \u2013 if we are priced adequately, we would love to spend more on advertising. Obviously, we are going to have competitive commission for our agents to place as much business as they can with us. But the underlying G&A or non-acquisition expense ratio is where we focus on continuing to get more competitive. And in the direct channel, we do have the luxury of having multiple other companies that we work with, the place property business, and we will proactively work with those companies to try and place business that we no longer want to be writing on our own paper. And obviously, in the independent agency channel, most agencies have multiple options. So, I mean you are right. As Tricia noted, we will likely lose some auto business as we reduce the risk in our homeowners book, but we also expect to keep a lot of those auto customers because of the options that we have in the direct channel as well as that \u2013 which our agents have. So, just a little clarity on what we are saying there. So, when we have a first-party total loss collision, we are going to pay that immediately. We are going to recognize the elevated cost of new and used cars right now when we are settling that claim. When we have a property damage claim, some of those claims we pay directly, and we would recognize that expense. Some of those claims \u2013 the parties are going through their personal auto carrier, and then that auto carrier reaches out to us and subrogates us, meaning they ask for the payment, and that is when we will see some of the increase in the total loss rate. We try and project that, obviously, in our reserves to be as accurate as possible in a world where it is moving as quick as it is right now, we don't always have that perfect. So, as we see more of those demands for total loss settlements from other insurance carriers, we are going to \u2013 we expect to see some similar experience in the property damage. Well, I would add to Tricia's comment that December's take rate for Snapshot were the highest we've seen ever. So yes, there were some influence from the pandemic on take rate there. But I think overall, there has been a growing acceptability in usage-based as a rating variable for auto insurance. And I think our December take rate in both channels, as Tricia mentioned, are indicative of that. So, we also obviously see competitors continuing to grow there, their UBI programs as well, which I think in aggregate enhances acceptability perceptions as well. So, we think that is definitely part of our future and even more so as the technology and vehicles allows us to get that new business. I was mentioning our ability to do that in the commercial space. And we have very limited ability to do that in the personal auto space, but we are doing it with data right from vehicles, but it's a small percentage of what we do. So, I think I would characterize take rate as continuing to grow. And with technology evolving, it's going to be an integral part of the product going forward. I can try that. This is simply an illustrative way to say we are not totally sure where the value of used cars is going. It's obviously been going up dramatically. As Tricia noted, we have seen some recent signs that it might be leveling off. We are certainly not pricing in our indications to anywhere towards the top of that cone. I would characterize our pricing assumptions more so towards the middle of the cone. But the reality is we \u2013 only time will tell where we ultimately fall in those cones. And that's the challenge of our business, and that's the point we are trying to get across in John and Kanik's presentation. And when we are trying to price for the future. The future is unknown, but we are not pricing towards the top of that. I would characterize our pricing assumptions as \u2013 towards the middle of that cone."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to The Progressive Corporation's Third Quarter investor event. The Company will not make detailed comments related to the quarterly results. In addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the latter to shareholders, which have been posted to the Company's website, although CEO - will make a brief statement. The Company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions. Acting as moderator for the event will be progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you [indiscernible] and good morning. Although our Quarterly Investor Relations event typically include the presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. Dialing instructions may be found at investors.progressive. com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarters of 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO Tricia Griffith will make some introductory comments. Tricia.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Doug. Good morning and welcome to Progressive Third Quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers returned to normal driving habits, as the country open from the pandemic and as supply constraints contributed to an unprecedented increase in vehicle valuation. In the third quarter, those challenges continued with the added effect of the most expensive storm in progressive history, hurricane Ida. The result of these challenges is our first quarter with an above 100 CR in 20 years. And through Progressive fashion, we're facing these challenges head on to do what's needed to meet our publicly stated goal of a 96 combined ratio on an annual basis.  As part of our efforts to ensure we meet our 96 target. We're taking rate increases across our product lines. While objections and regulators scrutiny our part of the revision process. The pressures on the insurance pricing, are real. The entire industry has been buffeted by the headwinds of higher severity, post-pandemic increased frequency, and weather-related catastrophes. Regulators take their mandate of adequate rates seriously. And as such, we've been able to work with regulators to increase rates to meet the rising costs.  Year-to-date through the third quarter, we've placed in-market increases in aggregate of 5 points in Personal Auto, 3 points in Commercial Lines, and 8 points in Property. In Personal Auto during the third quarter, rate increases were effective in 20 states, which had an average increase of about 6%. So we're taking the changes in the environment seriously and reacting decisively. We have more revisions and process across our suite of products, as we work to ensure the rest of 2021 and 2022 meet our calendar year objective. Underwriting is another lever that we're using to address profitability.  We continue to use this level in Commercial and Personal Lines to ensure we write exposures accurately and they meet our underwriting targets. In Personal Auto, our 8 dot 7 model, which is now in states representing about 40% of our premium, further advances the science of underwriting. And Homeowners, where profitability has been under pressure for several quarters, we are taking additional steps to hasten our progress to meet our profit objective. In the state with high CAT exposure, we've changed our underwriting rules to reduce our exposure, including targeted non-renewals. While non-renewals are not our preferred path, there are times where we need to use nontraditional methods to meet our targets.  While we take steps on the profitability side of the business, we continue to see strong growth. Personal Lines written premiums grew 7%, while Commercial Lines and Homeowners both saw double-digit year-over-year written premium growth in the 3rd quarter. Personal Lines and Homeowners recorded PIF growth of 8% and 13% in the quarter respectively. Commercial auto continues to capitalize on the macroeconomic environment with its third straight quarter of double-digit PIF growth, largely due to growth in the for-hire trucking segment. Though our underwriting actions often have the unfortunate side effect of reducing growth, our product managers continue to scour the competitive landscape to find profitable growth opportunities.  Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank Mike Seeger, our Claims President, and Jeff Cherny, our Chief Marketing Officer for their contributions to Progressive and to offer my congratulations on their planned retirement. While I'm confident that their replacements are up to the task, Mike and Jeff presence will be greatly missed. Thank you and I'm ready to take the first question.\nOperator: [ Operator instructions] one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nMike Zaremski: Hi. Good morning. I guess as an insurance geek, I kind of missed the deep dives you guys do. But -- So first question, I guess a lot of -- I know there'll be a lot of focus on and you gave a lot of color in the past about Personal Auto, the severity side of the equation. I was hoping to maybe get some of your insights on the frequency side. Maybe any color on the rate increases and actions Progressive is taking. Does it -- Is it some of the predicated on the potential for accident frequencies to continue increasing? You think they are kind of plateauing? I know they're nearing pre -pandemic levels, I guess I feel like that's kind of, an odd -- one of the bigger uncertainties out there.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Mike. Yes, that is a big uncertainty and we watch it closely, especially because we have so much data from our usage-based insurance on Snapshot. And there's a couple of interesting trends that I'd like to share, we're going to watch this closely again. There's been so many dynamic shifts since the pandemic that we really do have to watch, and then react swiftly to the data. So if you look at vehicle miles traveled, they haven't really changed since the last call.  There is still down about 6% to 8% from our 2017 and 2019 baseline. The bigger news that we've watched is frequency has picked up. And we've noticed that in each quarter, specifically in PD and collision. So let me give you a little bit of color of the things we watch for. So, during quarter 1, collision frequency was down about 10 points more than vehicle miles traveled. In quarter 2, that narrowed to 7 points, and in quarter 3, that narrowed further to 3 points. So we look at day parts. During quarter 3, that narrowing was across the whole day. During quarter 3, we saw that frequency narrow more during the morning rush hour, so think of 6 AM to 9 AM.  While we see some evidence that there's congestion as well, it's a little bit surprising to us because people haven't fully returned to the office. We read the headlines in most companies because the Delta variant have pushed off a full return to the office till January. So could it be that kids are going back to school so we're taking our children at school. So there's other variables that we're watching really closely. I think what will be interesting is to see what happens first quarter 2022, when many companies have stated they're going to return to work. And of course, what would that mean? It certainly won't mean full return for every single person, since I think there's going to be a lot of flexibility built in based on the pandemics. We think that'll be an interesting data point.  We also have observed frequency up sharply in the overnight hours. So think of like 1 to 6AM, both weekends and weekday is not correlated with the March reopening and that frequency is above pre - Covid levels by about 10% to 20%. Again, a smaller amount of people driving. So we're watching BMTs closely by day-part, each state, etc., and will be very interesting to see how frequency continues to close the gap on vehicle miles traveled or not. But we're going to watch that closely. So we were able to get a lot of interesting information from our telematics data and we're going to continue to watch that. Does that help Mike?\nMike Zaremski: Yes, thank you for that. My last follow-up question, if I may, if from -- if you look at Progressive's overall paid to incurred boss ratios, I know this is Company-wide. And if we exclude catastrophes, they seem to be down and a lot of the -- for a lot of the commercial cash tensures, we're seeing paid loss levels be down too and some of -- I'm excited that the codes being clogged are running slower. And I guess any color on what's -- anything that's going on there that points to maybe some conservatism in Progressive 's picks?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we think of our reserving, in any time frame, we want to be adequate with minimal variation, and that has been consistent for as long as I can remember. I think it's really hard to rely on historical metrics when we're looking at the data. So when you look at case IBNR or paid-to-incurred, whether you compare it to companies or even our own historical data, it's really hard without having the underlying data. So we have changers to our closure rate drop, and then rebound in frequency, increase in severity. All those ratios change when you look at that. What I would say about Progressive is that we feel very good about where we're at, again, with adequate -- with minimal variation. We're about a half point unfavorable for the year, and the majority of that can be attributed to Florida bit. So we don't believe there's conservative and we have not changed our model.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I preached in the comments in your letter about how you see two forms of risk from the regulatory environment. The first was the kind of risks around mandatory of rebates or just regulatory rebates or mandates around the profitability from 2020. I guess, on that one, are you referring to the possibility of more refunds that might happen and I guess that's -- and if so, how real is that risk?\nTricia Griffith: I was referring more to the asymmetry and the fact that we had this unprecedented event that hopefully none of us will have to live here in our lifetime where we had excess margins. And as an industry and certainly Progressive we swiftly gave that back to our customers and our 20% decrease over the 2 months. And then of course, when a decreased rates by another 3%, which equated to another $800 million on top of the $1 billion we gave back. So what I was referring to was now we're in a much different place. Severity trends are up 10 points, and we need rate. And we want to make sure in the end.  And we believe that regulators are rational. They want to make sure that we're open and available and have competitive rates, because that's good for all of our consumers. And so, what I was referring to there is when things change swiftly, it's got to go both sides. And in many of the states that we work with, and again, the majority of the regulators we're working with are really rational and get that they want to see the data which makes sense. They want to make sure the rates are adequate for their constituents. But we definitely need rate that is real.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Stepping feels real. I guess the second risk was just in line with that prospective rate increases. If -- are there concerns there from when you talk to regulators that maybe what you're seeing on the severity side isn't long lasting and therefore, we don't want to give rate increases if that's the case?\nTricia Griffith: Well, it is either because we're state regulated, and there are different ways with which rates get improved. And so different states look at it differently. So as you look at a state like California, their Department of Insurance requires us to look backwards to fill up the templates. So, while California was a little bit behind in frequency, it has picked up and is actually outpacing countrywide at this point. And so, when you fill up those templates, those rate indications are going to be distorted based on the data from last year. What we believe will happen is -- it's not reflective of the claims activity we're seeing.  So as frequency and severity trends earn in, we'll be able to put that in the templates and show that we will -- we're rate and adequate and then we'll be able to increase rates in California. For now, we're going to reduce our marketing spending in California to slow our growth, and continues to be able to update that department. So we work with every department, and every department is a little bit different. You can have file and use. You can file prior approval. We work with each department to make sure we give them the data they need to feel good about putting our rates on the street.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Good colors. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So, first I had a question just along the line that have been asked on the Auto business. Where are you and you mentioned California already, but where are you overall through the country in terms of your prices, catching up to what's happening with frequency and severity, and your margin sort of getting to what your long-term goals have been. Is this something that you think happens in the next three to six months or could it be even longer as you go through the whole process with states like California?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I think it could be a little bit longer than that depending on states. We think will continue to need a little bit more rate, and we're watching the trends carefully. We've talked often in the last -- actually probably 10 years about wanting to take smaller bites of the apple. So we're watching the trends closely, especially because they changed so dramatically since March of last year. And so we're going to watch those trends, and we'll react swiftly. What I would say is that there's a lot that goes into a premium, including average written premium, and that can change.  And it reflects differently depending on states. So you might have a high average written premium in a state like Florida, and if you don't have the right rates and you don't grow there, that would affect countrywide. So there's so many different inputs, including our consumers. So if you -- if you shrink in Sam's versus Robinson's, that will also affect average written premium because they have a higher average written premiums. So we're getting there, we believe will need more and then we'll continue to watch the trend again as they unfold. And I shared the opening question about how we're seeing the trends changed with our usage-based information. And then we'll react swiftly to those.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just on the Property -- the Homeowners business, I think margins --obviously, you saw gaps recently, but margins have been weak as far back as I could remember. I realize that you're trying to build the business, but is this a business that you think can be profitable on underwriting margins on it's its own or is it subsidizing auto or providing you other benefits that you're willing to continue to underwrite at a 100% plus combined ratio?\nTricia Griffith: So, we're not happy with writing it at a 100% combined ratio. We want to make an aggregate 96% in all of our products there. We have different but none of them are over 100, I assure you that. We don't want to subsidize. We do think it's great for our customers at Robinson's that want our brand, our home and auto bundles, so we'll continue to do that. But we know what we've done has started to work, but has not fully worked. Again, if you look at what has happened this year, a lot of it was based on catastrophes.  If you look at and compare it to the industry in more of the non-volatile states, we're actually very competitive. So we knew we need to do something different. So last year, we took up rates, a nearly 12 points this year, 8 points, and then we've talked about cost sharing with our customers. And more importantly, a couple of bigger things that we're doing to get us closer to our profitability is we're going to shift our portfolio of property over the next year or two. We have legacy states where ASI was really strong, and think of Texas, and Florida, Louisiana up through some of the hail alley.  We've had a lot of catastrophes. We have more exposure there because more of our book of business is there. So think of the rest of the state non-volatile. I mean, the rest of the country, non-volatile state, is a little bit over 50% of our portfolio. We're going to shift that over time to be more in the 60% to 70% of our portfolio, so shifting away from the volatile catastrophic coastal states. We are going to appoint more agents in those non-volatile states, reduce our agent footprint in the volatile states and make that movement to have a more balanced portfolio. And I talked in my opening remarks about some targeted non-renewals.  We will start to commence that, specifically in Florida. And we're going to work really around that focus on making sure we have more of a balanced portfolio. We both -- we are -- we still are very happy that we purchased ASI now Progressive home, we believe that's in our future, but our goal now is to get to profitability. We believe in the things that we're doing besides the rate increases, and I should mention continued segmentation. So that is a big piece of it. We're going to continue to enhance our segmentation like we have an auto product. And we believe those levers will certainly help us get to where we want to go.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I had a question just around PIF and conversion rates. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's going on in the direct segment. I saw the conversion rates were down only 2% in the quarter, which is a little bit less than I would've expected given some of the rate actions that you're taking. Maybe could you just talk about why this is down? Did that surprise you that it was down that much and not more? And I guess, why -- is that more of reflection of some of the price changes that you're putting through just haven't hit yet? Or does that really just speak to the competitive environment and peers increasing rates like you are?\nTricia Griffith: It's a great question, David. There's a bunch of different things including some timing of what was happening in quarter 3 of 2020. So when I think about conversion, I would go back to our decline in new app. So on the agency side, they are down about 14%. We think that prospect denominator was elevated in 2020. So, in 2020, there was virtually no shopping in quarter two. That move to quarter three, and then this year in addition, we pulled back on advertising. So we think conversion was stable, so we do think we still have a fairly competitive product on the direct side. On the agency side, In ups and down about 20% prospects were down slightly, but conversion was down a lot.  That was really due to material tightly underwriting restrictions we put into place, rate increases, and there's like 3 big States where we have material drops in conversion. Again, the timing-wise that may be overstated, even a bit based on the fact that there is a lot of stimulus going on at this time last year. And we also had high conversion in Michigan based on some coverage reform. But you talked specifically about the direct side. I think a lot of that has to do -- the reduction has been -- has to do with advertising from the new apps. So we feel good about our conversion, that could change as more rate come in, and as we reduced more advertising. Do you guys want to add anything?\nJohn Sauerland: I would add briefly that the other thing that could influence countrywide conversion is the mix of quotes we're getting across geographies. So with direct advertising, you have the ability to generate quotes at a very local level. And if we have concerns on profitability in an area where we previously had higher conversion, we will shut off or reduce the ad spend in that area, and that would then show the decrease in conversion just by that mix change. When we're adjusting ads spend at the local level, you can see changes in conversion in total simply by that mix. So rate is one thing for sure but interestingly on the direct side, you can also influence conversion based on your marketing spend.\nDoug Constantine: I would add just one further thing, that when our prospects fall because we spend less, then your conversion naturally goes up simply because you've got more engaged consumers when you're spending less; because they're motivated to come shop. So that will have a counteracting effect on conversion that will offset some of what rate increases would be doing.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That makes sense. So it sounds like we need to think about just quote volume as well in combination with just the conversion rate as well when thinking about that. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then I guess just for my follow-up, I guess I just had a question on the 5 points of rate that you've taken so far this year. My understanding is some of that is on new business, some of that's on the renewal book. I guess, when I look at the policyholder life expectancies, those were also a bit more resilient than I would've expected. I guess, maybe, could you just talk about how much of the 5 points that you've gotten this year has been -- I guess, how policyholders, existing policyholders seeing a lot of that 5 points yet? Or is that still on the come?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I would say, and Pat, you could add anything. I think that it's still yet to come because think of -- think if we had a rate change on the streets that's starting today, and I renewed yesterday. I had the old rate, so I've got that for 6 months. So I have -- we have some inflationary measures that work into their monthly rating factors. But then, I won't get that new one until that 6th month, and then, it earns in over that 6th month. So it really depends on timing and each state. And remember, it's 5% in aggregate, so it's different in different states depending on our needs, so that rate will continue to earn it. And that's one of the reasons why we continue to have the majority of our auto policies -- our private passenger auto policies on at 6 months position so we can be nimbler when we need to get rate. Thanks, David.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I know you've commented in the past on this, but given the changing moving parts within new business versus renewal, maybe you could just revisit your comments around the loss ratio, or combined ratio performance between the different cohorts. Because I suppose if new business is a little softer, theoretically you should get a corresponding lift if there is an impact in new business penalty.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean, I see -- I think I get your question. You guys could add on anything. Your new business has historically had a penalty when it's put on the books and it's different in agency and direct. That's why it's so important. We talk a lot about our holy grail being renewal business because we start to understand our customers better. On the direct side, we're loading all of our marketing costs on that first 6-months policy in the direct side. So I think when we look -- when I look at that, we look at -- attest differently, new PIPs versus renewal PIPs. Our renewal PIPs are still up. That could change.  I think David asked the question about PLE. We're still up 4% across both channels on trailing for PLE. So we hope that continues. That could fluctuate depending on how much rate we need. And then again, with new paths, we're down slightly maybe 10%. But again, that is very dependent on different commercial or tiers -- marking tier though we're down much more on some, so that affects that as well. So there's a lot of different factors that go into both the new and renewal. And -- did that answer your question or do you need more information?\nGreg Peters: And while it does answer the question, but I'm always -- I always welcome more information if you want to provide it.\nJohn Sauerland: The one thing I would add to that is that, you talked about the new business penalty. Of course, as Tricia mentioned, on direct business, there's a huge expense load difference. So as we're writing few hundred customers that flows through an advertising spend as well. So there's certainly a benefit on spending less and getting fewer new customers in the direct set, in terms of costs. In terms of loss ratio, we see a bigger differential between new and renewal on the Sam end of the spectrum than on the Robinson end of the spectrum. So to the extent we are reducing Sam's coming through the door relative to Robinson's, it would it would have a bigger benefit on the loss ratio side.  So there's some of that coming through, but you also have to recognize that our book is heavily, heavily weighted to renewal customers, so it can have some benefit. But in aggregate, we need the benefit of the rate flowing through the book, the new and renewal customers. It's going to flow through renewals sooner, and there's far less elasticity in the renewal book. So you will see average premiums rising sooner and more likely on the renewal side. On the new side, customers are shopping, and it's a highly elastic market. We'll see some of that rate. We'll see a little slower, or we'll probably see a little less of it simply because there are other options in the marketplace. And we move faster than others when it comes to taking rate when we need it.  So we think, and we've seen historically at least, that competitors are seeing the same trends we are. They will need the same price changes. It may take them longer. So we might see a bit imbalance on the new business front for a while. But again, our experiences, competitors see the same thing, they catch up, and by the time they do, we're in a very good position and very confident in growing more and turning advertising back up and the other growth levers we have.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I think that's great. And as long as, Greg, you want more information? If you go back to the last time we needed rate like this, it would be right around 2012, and we did the same thing. We have a great pricing organization, they're able to get the rates on the street relatively quickly usually before our compensation. So when the market turns hard, we believe we're more competitive and that's really what we're positioning ourselves for right now.\nGreg Peters: I appreciate the color. I guess, the second question is more detail-oriented because you've mentioned that -- I'm talking about Florida PIP. You've mentioned that we heard it from others. Maybe you could just take a minute and provide us your perspective of what's going on with that. When we see charges for a specific issue, it's my perspective that it's never 1 bite at the apple fixes that. It takes us a couple of bites before it's -- you finally got it resolved. And so I'm left wondering with Florida PIP if we're not in third or fourth inning and we're going to have a couple more adverse hits from that specific issue before it resolves itself. So just some history on what's going on there and what you think about going forward.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I mean Florida PIF is such an anomaly in terms of what can happen with plaintiffs\u2019 bar there. So you can -- if something can go through the system, it can seem really good, and then it's challenged. And if it's lost in a one part of the state, and then appealed and lost your one in one part of the state. Different things are always happening. With what we have currently, we feel very good about our reserving for PIF and where we're going. That can change any time because plaintiff attorneys in Florida, specifically, can challenge anything, and then you have to make sure you are thinking about the future.  Do you have to reopen? We try to do in anything like this happens where a case of loss by a competitor and usually when a case of lost by us or any competitor it affects the majority of the competitors. And then we determine, is it worth fighting? How long? What does that mean exactly? And we work towards getting it wrapped up and that's really what we're doing right now. We are trying to wrap these up we're trying to do some bigger global settlement of maybe a law firm that has many of our insurers with its litigation to get it wrapped up quickly and as inexpensive way as possible. I can't tell you that something won't be challenged next year.  It will tell you that we've talked about it more internally because Florida PIP goes with these ebbs and flows of what happens depending on what happens with PIP perform or not. And so, we're starting to think. More with Florida PIP almost like you do a cat load in some of those other states. And because this does -- this does come more often so I can tell you is we're looking at more like that which is differently than we've done in the past.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answer.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for your help. I have a couple of questions on the home business in particular. And first 1, how impactful is the home non-renewal on growth of the new product? I think it's been a long time since you've actually done non-renewals, but bundled product. You've -- obviously, auto piece is really important to you guys. Is that something we should see in the numbers or is it pretty small?\nTricia Griffith: Well if -- we have a number of what we believe will be non-renewals. And then we take it down to each customer to say, are there customers that have maybe something has changed with their home, that they've updated their roofs that we can continue to have on the books? We look to see if some of our unaffiliated partners could help if they wanted to take the customers. And it's going to take a while because there's actually a time frame with which we need to work with the Florida Department to make sure that we give a lot of notice. So you're not going to see those first non-renewals happening till May of next year. But we think it will be significant because this cohort of customers are really, really, really unprofitable.  And so we need to get there in addition to moving our footprint more towards non-volatile states. So there's a lot of work to be done before we know the exact number. We obviously have a number of where we think we start with and then we're going to try to work with our customers. We also -- we'll give the customers an opportunity to stay with Progressive if they opt into the new roof payment schedule, which is where there will be some -- a coverage options to share the cost of the replacement with us. So a lot going on there.  And no we don't do non-renewals very often it's -- and usually, you try to get the rate for it, but these customers are very unprofitable. We couldn't get enough rate to have them ever be close to profitable, and that's why we need to do that. It's never something we want to do, but as we looked at our whole portfolio and our strategy going forward, we realize this is an important piece to start as -- to start to set as ship straight.\nJohn Sauerland: And while we -- we don't know exactly how many customers we'll have to, now, renew, and as Tricia said, we're trying to work with customers for options to stay with us. You should think of a very low single-digit percentage of our policies enforced countrywide. But this is not a huge shift, but it's a shift, as Tricia was saying, geographically. So while we want to reduce our footprint in the volatile space, we want to grow in the less volatile space. So in aggregate, our objective is still to grow. It's simply to grow in different areas.\nPaul Newsome: Great. And I actually want to follow up on just that comment on the move into the non-coastal states, the result of states. I would've thought that mainly I just -- that you would have had a lot of these agents already signed up in the -- you have a pretty growing broad national Carrier Agency Distribution to begin with. Was there something in the process that kept you in earlier years from expanding earlier from an agent perspective or -- because I would've thought that today you pretty much have all those agents you'd want Outside of the coastal areas signed up?\nTricia Griffith: It's our original and final purchase. ASI was more of a scarcity model. And so we had platinum agents that or appointed to sell auto and home. So we have a lot of opportunity to appoint more platinum agents in the non-volatile states. So that's what we're working on right now.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous.\nRyan Tunis: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just want -- I think, about ASI. It's been clearly, a successful deal from a growth standpoint, but the value proposition to agents has always seemingly been that. You guys would write good insurance in [Indiscernible] states like Florida and Texas.\nRyan Tunis: I guess what I'm trying to think about is -- we've seen good growth of the Robinson's. But most of the ASI book is in those two states. How are we going to continue to grow the Robinson's and kind of given there's geographic move and how our agents reacting to it in Florida and Texas?\nTricia Griffith: Well, right now on our non-volatile states it's actually -- we have about 54%. So we have been expanding over the last several years to have less density in those states. We are purposely doing this to make sure that we can take care of the majority of that consumers. There's some like we said with the non-renewals than we can. And I think Insurance gets out. I think agents get bad because they also see the data. So for us to make sure we can protect those states, we need to make sure that we only have so much density in those states. So, for us, Florida and Texas are a big part, but still the non-volatile states are our majority of 54%. We're going to get those to 60% to 70% over the last couple -- the next couple of years. And when we look at that compared to the industry, we outperformed based on that state mix. Again, we got to change that state mix to make sure that flows through with everything.\nRyan Tunis: And then, I guess another foll -- sorry go ahead.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I was going to say something.\nRyan Tunis: I was going to say you referenced the majority of the book being in those two states sets. That's a little heavier than reality. And since we became owners of ARX/ASI, we have been diversifying the book. Now, it hasn't always been to the less volatile states, unfortunately, so we have grown in some other volatile states, think Hail Alley, but we have done a lot to diversify the book. We've just come to the more recent realization that we need to diversify more and faster. And I guess one other thing is -- I'm wondering if maybe you guys are overreacting just a little bit to the elevated costs Even this quarter, you guys have done a great job with reinsurance. Accounts are still not a significant part of your loss costs roll into the most insurers. I'm just wondering why this is really that big of a deal, especially because you have the reinsurance. I always thought that home was more -- not a loss leader per se, but the purpose of selling home was to sell well's business and that's been successful. So why abandon that, or why kind of move away from that simply because you have an extra couple of points of costs\nTricia Griffith: Our purposes to have -- to having a home, specifically in the agency channel, was to grow more Robinson, but it was never going to be a loss leader. It was to make money on the home and make money on the auto bundle, have great claims service. So, that hasn't changed. So, I might say we're overreacting if we did this a year ago or 2 years ago, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter, where we're struggling to make money and cats is a big part of it. Reinsurance is great, but it doesn't come without a pretty heavy cause. So we want to make sure that we use our shareholders capital the right way. And we believe this is the best way to do it.\nJohn Sauerland: We're just -- we're not only reacting to the results. We've been digging harder into the modeling and looking at our exposure for what they could best look like even after reinsurance. So while we are heavily reinsured and we're pretty [indiscernible] relative to our total insured value, especially those cut states, there are still potential scenarios. And that's what we're trying to manage. The tail risk is still there. We haven't seen it. But we want to be proactive in managing that, so that we don't see that down the road.\nPat Callahan: And one thing that I would add on top, John, and I think you mentioned it, but it's not about shrinking our book in the volatile states. It's about accelerating growth in the less volatile states while we have a period of time where we're investing in product segmentation, and as Tricia mentioned, product features that risk share with our customers. So don't think of it as abandoning the property business in any way, shape, or form. It's a temporary acceleration of growth in less volatile states until we get to a more comfortable balance between volatile and less volatile.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just one quick technical one. Of the disclosed auto rate increases that you give us, how much of that is coming from the monthly rating factors?\nTricia Griffith: A small part of that.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Good morning. Could you help me understand how it works in practice, the process you go through request at rate increase in a filing in new state because it doesn't seem to be that simple, as filing new. We've been seeing back-and-forth objections and iteration. So maybe just to walk through an example in Texas, it's our understanding that the public hearing on your previous set of filing has been postponed due to ongoing settlement discussions. In the meantime, it looks like you've submitted two new rate filings for your independent agent and direct business. So I guess where I'm getting at is how long should a filing be in a state of limbo way past the requested effective dates?\nTricia Griffith: Great question. So we use Texas as a file-and-use state. So we put the files out there. We were able to put them on the street. They don't need to approve the filings. However, they can disapprove. They have not disapproved our filings and rather filed objections for that. Objections don't mean rejections of our rates. What that means is they want more information. So we've been working with the TDI on making sure supplement, all the information we can have to support our rate level. In fact, since April, we have done a 3-rate increases, one that's just a couple weeks ago. So, hitting into the fourth quarter, that totaled around 13%. So, we don't have our rate hearing.  In fact, they issued a notice for our July filing, but we're sending because we're trying to work back-and-forth on making sure we do the right thing. Again, we had a good long-term relationship with the TDI and we believe they're rational and they want the data to make sure they do the right thing. And if you look at the filings, there are -- we're in good Company with many of our competitors where they're asking for more information. We want to be competitive, and open and available for the people of Texas. So every state is that it could have a little nuance to it, but that, hopefully, gives you a little bit of light of Texas. Objection is just the back-and-forth of data.\nTracy Benguigui: Is there an expiration of those back-and-forth discussions?\nPat Callahan: No. Typically, it will reset a clock. So some states will have a dimmer provision where there's not an objection filed, than it will be deemed approved after a certain date. But the ongoing especially in preserving great relationships with our regulators, if there's open questions we want to be transparent and provide them the data they need to do their jobs.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And also, it looks like you're not the only one, and the insurers are making filing rate increases, but it's not uniform like the largest auto rider is lagging on those efforts. So, how can that uneven in like impact the progress of rate increased discussions with your regulators? And how do you think about increased shopping behavior?\nPat Callahan: Well the competitive environment that we operate in has some pretty different business models. So whether you have a mutual structure or a stock Company as two good examples, and as a result, there's different motivating factors, different profit objectives, different targets. So while we can't comment on specific area or action, we operate our business to deliver, as Tricia said, the $0.04, and grow as fast as we can. And that may mean that our growth is a little lumpier, but our profitability is generally pretty consistent.\nTracy Benguigui: Yeah. I guess, if I look at the last time the market tried to push rate increases, let's call 2015. It's just seemed like a while for the mutual to catch up. And many mutuals now are taking notice and maybe asking questions, but different Company by Company. But I think that may just present opportunities for shopping in general. I'm not trying to pick on one insurer. So how do you think about that in general?\nPat Callahan: We fully expect as rates go up that will create shopping and we enjoy. We believe a larger share of the shoppers than we do of that overall market. So generally, that's been good for us when there is a hardening market that create shopping. We benefit because we're broadly distributed and try to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for and buy insurance.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, but we're not going to change our model because this is in the model with some of the mutual for many years and the money they make is more on the investment side. We're still going to, with many of our competitors, we want to make a profit on the underwriting side. We want to grow as fast as we can, but we're not going to knowingly put a bunch of unprofitable business on our book. And that's why we're pulling back on advertising and during the rate increases. But again, like I said in a prior question, we believe this really positions us well for what we believe might happen as the market turns, and we'll be positioned where the shopping happens. We're going to get a lot of that business. And when that happens, we don't exactly know, but that's why we are positioning ourselves where we're at now based on the data that we see.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Tracy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Can we talk a little about in the transition when the business is underpriced and your competitors are raising price. Customers still are likely, they come to you maybe at a margin that's not entirely attract ive. We can have a business that's going to come in the doors the next 3 to 6 to 9 months. Even without advertising, I think people will come to Progressive because of your funnel. How -- what's the stickiness of that business at the current price? How do you think about the margins on that business and what is the long-term value of the customers who are coming in the hair pin transition? Yeah, besides advertising, we really do try to have some tighter underwriting restrictions to not have as much of that business come on the books. Clearly, they are going to come on the books because timing is everything, and so we would get some of that business. Some of it will be underpriced, and I'll get it in renewal. And some of it, if it's overpriced and they shop, they will leave, and that will be okay, especially with what we believe is our industry-leading segmentation, especially if we have data from our snapshot. So it's hard to stay in an environment like this because there's so many variables happening. But clearly we'll get some business on the books based on our brand, and people want to come, and the pricing doesn't hit all at once in the industry.\nPat Callahan: Yeah. No, I think that's exactly it. Over the lifetime of these customers, we do expect to hit our targets, and we do price to a lifetime model. Additionally, there's value in selling other products to these customers and establishing a relationship with them now. Even if they may not be priced completely to target, it's not a bad thing for the long-term health and growth of the business.\nJosh Shanker: And without emphasizing it too much, the Sams, I guess, are going to be looking for the best prices. It feels like you guys are about 6 months ahead of the industry in adjusting your price Can the Sams find a provider with a smaller funnel than Progressive who hasn't raised their price yet, or are you still going to pick up a fairly good share of Sams regardless even while you're raising prices because your customer acquisition capabilities are so strong?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I think Sams will be able to find a price out there. In fact, I talked a little bit about new business tests being down and they're down mostly in Sams because they're one, inconsistently insured and they frequently shop because it is really about price. So yeah, I think they'll find it and then when the --the Sams is very much about price. So as those companies raise their rates, they'll come back to us. At that point, we'll be competitively priced to make a lifetime 96 on those Sams.\nJosh Shanker: Ma'am, thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Tricia, I can't disagree with your viewpoint of the regulators as being rational, but sometimes it takes a lot longer than we would hope for that to manifest itself. So I was hoping you could clarify the difference between the indicated rate increases that we would infer from frequency and severity trends in the 5% that you've gotten so far. How much of that is regulatory friction and how much of that is Progressive slowing the increases to maintain retention?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, we're not trying to slow the increases for retention. If we slow increases, it's because, like I talked about in California, the mechanism is more backward-looking than what we're seeing in the claims. So we will try to get the amount of rate we think we needed that time against small bites of the apple. And as we've seen more data, we'll either won't raise rates, or like last year, or reduced rates, or raise them a little bit more. But the regulator timing is really an individual conversation we're having across the country. I gave a couple of examples in Texas and California. California going to take a little bit longer, so we are going to try to reduce our growth there. But I think it's really where we priced our indications and we look at that prospectively.\nPat Callahan: Yeah. The one thing I would add is there's just acceleration in our rate takes. So the 5% of the year-to-date number and as Tricia mentioned in Q3, in half the country, we increased rates about 6% cut 3 in that period. So there's 6 months of the year before we saw the real frequency recovery that we were still lowering rates, frankly. And that's factored in there.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And that's pricing compared to, I guess, end of year 2020?\nPat Callahan: Correct.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Second question. Can you talk about what the catastrophe loss exposure in homeowners means for small commercial property?\nJochen Schunter: Yeah. The -- so our small commercial property book is very, very small at this juncture. While we are trying to grow our business owner's policy program. And I think we're now in 29 states --\nTricia Griffith: 31 now.\nJochen Schunter: 31 now. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: 29, we've been [Indiscernible] at the cue, it's 31 by the time we have this meeting.\nJochen Schunter: Yeah. Our property exposure at this juncture, Commercial Lines is very minimal. We aspire to have far bigger share of that business. And at that point, you're right, it will be something we need to manage proactively. At this juncture, it's really not material.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question is going back to the Personal Auto rating discussion on just said you talked around 6 points of rate in the third quarter. That still does put you below where frequency, for severity are on a combined basis. Tricia, I think earlier in the call, you said that it would probably take more than 3 to 6 months for all these weight to pull through the system. So, when you make that comment, are you thinking that you will at some point get the approvals and get rates in excessive trends or are you also assuming maybe that severity, which is a bit elevated and impacted by the supply chain issues over that time period severity trends might improve, or maybe it's a combination of both.\nTricia Griffith: Well, I would say I'll let Pat add what he has. And we will look at prospective need for rate increase, and that's why we're following the trend so closely. And again, they -- there -- it's so volatile based on what's been happening and it could change back and forth. So we'll continue to get that. And we will likely, at this point, if trends continue, we'll see that we'll need even more rate in the fourth quarter and probably into Q1.\nPat Callahan: Yeah. We price to our expected cost. And as far out as we can see, the effective date of our revision or the average date of that revision. we're setting our prices based on where we expect trend to be. If trend continues to accelerate, we'll continue to take rate. If trend ameliorates, we'll slow our rate take and not file for additional increases.\nTricia Griffith: That's why it's important to be really nimble. And that's why I often talk about our pricing group and what we're able to get to really quickly and decisively. And if you couldn't do that, you might have to take way more rate because it's going to be a big issue to do that. But we're able to be so nimble that we can do that. Watch trends and if we need a little bit more or not, we can act accordingly.\nPat Callahan: And that's the key for individual consumers, right? That they get a small increase at renewal which doesn't prompt them to shop as opposed to somebody that waits. And if they wait 6 months or 12 months. And at that point in 88 points or rate are something higher, it creates shopping in your book that's just not healthy, frankly, for the health of the overall book.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, sorry, in terms of capital management, you guys shifted to quarterly dividend and going back a few years ago. And then we do -- you have been still been playing a special dividend at the end of most years. This year, obviously, growth is a little lighter given the rate, the rate you're taking. And also, we've seen profitability be impacted by loss trends in auto and cats in home is a prospect for a special dividend still on the table, or how should we think about capital return for this year?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we're meeting with the Board in December and they will ultimately make the decision on the variable dividend and what we would intend to give throughout the year. We look at all the inputs like you suggest to determine what makes sense. And that's one of the reasons why we changed the dividend policy several years ago because it can from a timing perspective be different from what we're seeing internally, from the gain share program that we aligned it with several years ago. So we're working with the board, and ultimately, it will be their decision in December on how much they believe the variable dividend will be up for this year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks, Trish. Back in the personal auto. Just quickly here. So what is your expectations of kind of claim severity here going forward? Do you expect this inflationary environment to persist here for a while? So when you're thinking about filing rates, your kind of assuming these kind of elevated severity levels?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we're watching closely because there's so much in play. So obviously if you look at the severity on collision, it's up 14%. And you've been watching what has happened. And as an example was the Manheim Used Car Index. I mean, even the first few weeks of October, it was up 8% over September. And then if you look at October 20 to October 21, it was up 37%. And then pre -pandemic to now, up over 50%. Some of those huge increases we've never seen, so we'll have to watch and see what happens with the supply of chips. Does that open up the supply demand of new cars and used parts? We do have -- we're off a little bit with frequency on salvage returns.  So we're going to watch that closely. What we haven't seen yet in body shops are labor rates increasing. They've been relatively flat. We'll watch that, especially when you think about talent in that area. And we have seen the labor -- I mean, parts prices up right around 5%. Some of that's inflation, and some of that is just inherently expensive parts and more expensive vehicles. So those are the things we're watching, and we have trend meetings all the time, really closely to see if this sort of inflation is transitory or baked into our system.\nBrian Meredith: Okay. It has to be determined I guess.\nTricia Griffith: Yes.\nBrian Meredith: And then I guess my next question, maybe just to simplify this a little bit. If I look back historically, it's generally taken you all about 6 to 9 months to get enough rate for margins to return to, call it, more normalized levels. Look at '12, it happened that way, '16 happened that way. Is there anything different this time around that we should expect that you'll be able to get enough rate to the system to become rate adequate in the next 6 to 9 months?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I think '16 was a little bit different because most of the rate we needed was on the commercial side and those are 12-month policies. I think what we've been talking about a lot in this call was regulatory, just some of the objections. It might take a little longer with those dates as we provide more data. But we expect to, as we have in the past, be in that position in that 6-month timeframe, hopefully sooner.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Thank you for taking another question. Very helpful context to hear that you want to take multiple bites of the apple and be agile as you're thinking about future rate increases, but I'm just wondering, as you're thinking about it, is that 6% that you took in the third quarter? Is that in your view, more of maintaining where you are on loss trend or that be getting more into your long-term combined ratio target similar on improvement of margin?\nTricia Griffith: It's on improvement of margins and where we're at with the data we have now that we do look at those prospectively but if we believe we need more and I think the question that Brian just asked makes a lot of sense if we're watching some of the inflationary trends and will launch those closely as we believe we will need those and we'll get more.\nJohn Sauerland: I want to offer -- one point of clarification and a little more color. One is that we've heard twice people say we took 6 points of rate in the third quarter. We actually took 3 in our Personal Auto. We took 6 points in about half the country, which gets you to 3 -- 5 year-to-date. And we're going to continue to take rates. So whenever you're taking rate, you are either or both, catching up from what you didn't see when you first priced or you\u2019re pricing for the future. So in a perfect world you're just always pricing for the future, and your previous pricing was perfect. That's normally not the case.  You're either a little higher or a little low on your previous pricing. So some of that adjustment is catching up in this environment. It's catching up, frankly. But it is also looking forward as to what we believe frequency and severity trends will be for the coming life of that rate revision be at 6, 12 months. So I just wanted to clarify on what we've taken year-to-date and we say it is -- to some degree catching up, but to a large degree, ensuring we have a very adequate rates on the street going into 2022, so that we're very confident to turn on more advertising and other growth levers.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, I would add that -- so do I. I gave the percentages of what happened with used cars and, obviously, the things that would happen with supply chain. I think the industry overall, missed that because who would have ever thought used parts will go up to that extent. So that -- those are just some of the things we're catching up, and Gary, that 6% was in 20 states? Yes.\nTracy Benguigui: Yes. Thank you. I recognize 20 states. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nDoug Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Deshundra (ph), I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's third-quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. Good morning and welcome to Progressive Third Quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers returned to normal driving habits, as the country open from the pandemic and as supply constraints contributed to an unprecedented increase in vehicle valuation. In the third quarter, those challenges continued with the added effect of the most expensive storm in progressive history, hurricane Ida. The result of these challenges is our first quarter with an above 100 CR in 20 years. And through Progressive fashion, we're facing these challenges head on to do what's needed to meet our publicly stated goal of a 96 combined ratio on an annual basis.  As part of our efforts to ensure we meet our 96 target. We're taking rate increases across our product lines. While objections and regulators scrutiny our part of the revision process. The pressures on the insurance pricing, are real. The entire industry has been buffeted by the headwinds of higher severity, post-pandemic increased frequency, and weather-related catastrophes. Regulators take their mandate of adequate rates seriously. And as such, we've been able to work with regulators to increase rates to meet the rising costs.  Year-to-date through the third quarter, we've placed in-market increases in aggregate of 5 points in Personal Auto, 3 points in Commercial Lines, and 8 points in Property. In Personal Auto during the third quarter, rate increases were effective in 20 states, which had an average increase of about 6%. So we're taking the changes in the environment seriously and reacting decisively. We have more revisions and process across our suite of products, as we work to ensure the rest of 2021 and 2022 meet our calendar year objective. Underwriting is another lever that we're using to address profitability.  We continue to use this level in Commercial and Personal Lines to ensure we write exposures accurately and they meet our underwriting targets. In Personal Auto, our 8 dot 7 model, which is now in states representing about 40% of our premium, further advances the science of underwriting. And Homeowners, where profitability has been under pressure for several quarters, we are taking additional steps to hasten our progress to meet our profit objective. In the state with high CAT exposure, we've changed our underwriting rules to reduce our exposure, including targeted non-renewals. While non-renewals are not our preferred path, there are times where we need to use nontraditional methods to meet our targets.  While we take steps on the profitability side of the business, we continue to see strong growth. Personal Lines written premiums grew 7%, while Commercial Lines and Homeowners both saw double-digit year-over-year written premium growth in the 3rd quarter. Personal Lines and Homeowners recorded PIF growth of 8% and 13% in the quarter respectively. Commercial auto continues to capitalize on the macroeconomic environment with its third straight quarter of double-digit PIF growth, largely due to growth in the for-hire trucking segment. Though our underwriting actions often have the unfortunate side effect of reducing growth, our product managers continue to scour the competitive landscape to find profitable growth opportunities.  Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank Mike Seeger, our Claims President, and Jeff Cherny, our Chief Marketing Officer for their contributions to Progressive and to offer my congratulations on their planned retirement. While I'm confident that their replacements are up to the task, Mike and Jeff presence will be greatly missed. Thank you and I'm ready to take the first question. Thanks, Mike. Yes, that is a big uncertainty and we watch it closely, especially because we have so much data from our usage-based insurance on Snapshot. And there's a couple of interesting trends that I'd like to share, we're going to watch this closely again. There's been so many dynamic shifts since the pandemic that we really do have to watch, and then react swiftly to the data. So if you look at vehicle miles traveled, they haven't really changed since the last call.  There is still down about 6% to 8% from our 2017 and 2019 baseline. The bigger news that we've watched is frequency has picked up. And we've noticed that in each quarter, specifically in PD and collision. So let me give you a little bit of color of the things we watch for. So, during quarter 1, collision frequency was down about 10 points more than vehicle miles traveled. In quarter 2, that narrowed to 7 points, and in quarter 3, that narrowed further to 3 points. So we look at day parts. During quarter 3, that narrowing was across the whole day. During quarter 3, we saw that frequency narrow more during the morning rush hour, so think of 6 AM to 9 AM.  While we see some evidence that there's congestion as well, it's a little bit surprising to us because people haven't fully returned to the office. We read the headlines in most companies because the Delta variant have pushed off a full return to the office till January. So could it be that kids are going back to school so we're taking our children at school. So there's other variables that we're watching really closely. I think what will be interesting is to see what happens first quarter 2022, when many companies have stated they're going to return to work. And of course, what would that mean? It certainly won't mean full return for every single person, since I think there's going to be a lot of flexibility built in based on the pandemics. We think that'll be an interesting data point.  We also have observed frequency up sharply in the overnight hours. So think of like 1 to 6AM, both weekends and weekday is not correlated with the March reopening and that frequency is above pre - Covid levels by about 10% to 20%. Again, a smaller amount of people driving. So we're watching BMTs closely by day-part, each state, etc., and will be very interesting to see how frequency continues to close the gap on vehicle miles traveled or not. But we're going to watch that closely. So we were able to get a lot of interesting information from our telematics data and we're going to continue to watch that. Does that help Mike? Well, we think of our reserving, in any time frame, we want to be adequate with minimal variation, and that has been consistent for as long as I can remember. I think it's really hard to rely on historical metrics when we're looking at the data. So when you look at case IBNR or paid-to-incurred, whether you compare it to companies or even our own historical data, it's really hard without having the underlying data. So we have changers to our closure rate drop, and then rebound in frequency, increase in severity. All those ratios change when you look at that. What I would say about Progressive is that we feel very good about where we're at, again, with adequate -- with minimal variation. We're about a half point unfavorable for the year, and the majority of that can be attributed to Florida bit. So we don't believe there's conservative and we have not changed our model. Thanks, Mike. I was referring more to the asymmetry and the fact that we had this unprecedented event that hopefully none of us will have to live here in our lifetime where we had excess margins. And as an industry and certainly Progressive we swiftly gave that back to our customers and our 20% decrease over the 2 months. And then of course, when a decreased rates by another 3%, which equated to another $800 million on top of the $1 billion we gave back. So what I was referring to was now we're in a much different place. Severity trends are up 10 points, and we need rate. And we want to make sure in the end.  And we believe that regulators are rational. They want to make sure that we're open and available and have competitive rates, because that's good for all of our consumers. And so, what I was referring to there is when things change swiftly, it's got to go both sides. And in many of the states that we work with, and again, the majority of the regulators we're working with are really rational and get that they want to see the data which makes sense. They want to make sure the rates are adequate for their constituents. But we definitely need rate that is real. Well, it is either because we're state regulated, and there are different ways with which rates get improved. And so different states look at it differently. So as you look at a state like California, their Department of Insurance requires us to look backwards to fill up the templates. So, while California was a little bit behind in frequency, it has picked up and is actually outpacing countrywide at this point. And so, when you fill up those templates, those rate indications are going to be distorted based on the data from last year. What we believe will happen is -- it's not reflective of the claims activity we're seeing.  So as frequency and severity trends earn in, we'll be able to put that in the templates and show that we will -- we're rate and adequate and then we'll be able to increase rates in California. For now, we're going to reduce our marketing spending in California to slow our growth, and continues to be able to update that department. So we work with every department, and every department is a little bit different. You can have file and use. You can file prior approval. We work with each department to make sure we give them the data they need to feel good about putting our rates on the street. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, I think it could be a little bit longer than that depending on states. We think will continue to need a little bit more rate, and we're watching the trends carefully. We've talked often in the last -- actually probably 10 years about wanting to take smaller bites of the apple. So we're watching the trends closely, especially because they changed so dramatically since March of last year. And so we're going to watch those trends, and we'll react swiftly. What I would say is that there's a lot that goes into a premium, including average written premium, and that can change.  And it reflects differently depending on states. So you might have a high average written premium in a state like Florida, and if you don't have the right rates and you don't grow there, that would affect countrywide. So there's so many different inputs, including our consumers. So if you -- if you shrink in Sam's versus Robinson's, that will also affect average written premium because they have a higher average written premiums. So we're getting there, we believe will need more and then we'll continue to watch the trend again as they unfold. And I shared the opening question about how we're seeing the trends changed with our usage-based information. And then we'll react swiftly to those. So, we're not happy with writing it at a 100% combined ratio. We want to make an aggregate 96% in all of our products there. We have different but none of them are over 100, I assure you that. We don't want to subsidize. We do think it's great for our customers at Robinson's that want our brand, our home and auto bundles, so we'll continue to do that. But we know what we've done has started to work, but has not fully worked. Again, if you look at what has happened this year, a lot of it was based on catastrophes.  If you look at and compare it to the industry in more of the non-volatile states, we're actually very competitive. So we knew we need to do something different. So last year, we took up rates, a nearly 12 points this year, 8 points, and then we've talked about cost sharing with our customers. And more importantly, a couple of bigger things that we're doing to get us closer to our profitability is we're going to shift our portfolio of property over the next year or two. We have legacy states where ASI was really strong, and think of Texas, and Florida, Louisiana up through some of the hail alley.  We've had a lot of catastrophes. We have more exposure there because more of our book of business is there. So think of the rest of the state non-volatile. I mean, the rest of the country, non-volatile state, is a little bit over 50% of our portfolio. We're going to shift that over time to be more in the 60% to 70% of our portfolio, so shifting away from the volatile catastrophic coastal states. We are going to appoint more agents in those non-volatile states, reduce our agent footprint in the volatile states and make that movement to have a more balanced portfolio. And I talked in my opening remarks about some targeted non-renewals.  We will start to commence that, specifically in Florida. And we're going to work really around that focus on making sure we have more of a balanced portfolio. We both -- we are -- we still are very happy that we purchased ASI now Progressive home, we believe that's in our future, but our goal now is to get to profitability. We believe in the things that we're doing besides the rate increases, and I should mention continued segmentation. So that is a big piece of it. We're going to continue to enhance our segmentation like we have an auto product. And we believe those levers will certainly help us get to where we want to go. Thanks. It's a great question, David. There's a bunch of different things including some timing of what was happening in quarter 3 of 2020. So when I think about conversion, I would go back to our decline in new app. So on the agency side, they are down about 14%. We think that prospect denominator was elevated in 2020. So, in 2020, there was virtually no shopping in quarter two. That move to quarter three, and then this year in addition, we pulled back on advertising. So we think conversion was stable, so we do think we still have a fairly competitive product on the direct side. On the agency side, In ups and down about 20% prospects were down slightly, but conversion was down a lot.  That was really due to material tightly underwriting restrictions we put into place, rate increases, and there's like 3 big States where we have material drops in conversion. Again, the timing-wise that may be overstated, even a bit based on the fact that there is a lot of stimulus going on at this time last year. And we also had high conversion in Michigan based on some coverage reform. But you talked specifically about the direct side. I think a lot of that has to do -- the reduction has been -- has to do with advertising from the new apps. So we feel good about our conversion, that could change as more rate come in, and as we reduced more advertising. Do you guys want to add anything? Yeah. I would say, and Pat, you could add anything. I think that it's still yet to come because think of -- think if we had a rate change on the streets that's starting today, and I renewed yesterday. I had the old rate, so I've got that for 6 months. So I have -- we have some inflationary measures that work into their monthly rating factors. But then, I won't get that new one until that 6th month, and then, it earns in over that 6th month. So it really depends on timing and each state. And remember, it's 5% in aggregate, so it's different in different states depending on our needs, so that rate will continue to earn it. And that's one of the reasons why we continue to have the majority of our auto policies -- our private passenger auto policies on at 6 months position so we can be nimbler when we need to get rate. Thanks, David. Yeah. I mean, I see -- I think I get your question. You guys could add on anything. Your new business has historically had a penalty when it's put on the books and it's different in agency and direct. That's why it's so important. We talk a lot about our holy grail being renewal business because we start to understand our customers better. On the direct side, we're loading all of our marketing costs on that first 6-months policy in the direct side. So I think when we look -- when I look at that, we look at -- attest differently, new PIPs versus renewal PIPs. Our renewal PIPs are still up. That could change.  I think David asked the question about PLE. We're still up 4% across both channels on trailing for PLE. So we hope that continues. That could fluctuate depending on how much rate we need. And then again, with new paths, we're down slightly maybe 10%. But again, that is very dependent on different commercial or tiers -- marking tier though we're down much more on some, so that affects that as well. So there's a lot of different factors that go into both the new and renewal. And -- did that answer your question or do you need more information? Yeah, I think that's great. And as long as, Greg, you want more information? If you go back to the last time we needed rate like this, it would be right around 2012, and we did the same thing. We have a great pricing organization, they're able to get the rates on the street relatively quickly usually before our compensation. So when the market turns hard, we believe we're more competitive and that's really what we're positioning ourselves for right now. Yeah, I mean Florida PIF is such an anomaly in terms of what can happen with plaintiffs' bar there. So you can -- if something can go through the system, it can seem really good, and then it's challenged. And if it's lost in a one part of the state, and then appealed and lost your one in one part of the state. Different things are always happening. With what we have currently, we feel very good about our reserving for PIF and where we're going. That can change any time because plaintiff attorneys in Florida, specifically, can challenge anything, and then you have to make sure you are thinking about the future.  Do you have to reopen? We try to do in anything like this happens where a case of loss by a competitor and usually when a case of lost by us or any competitor it affects the majority of the competitors. And then we determine, is it worth fighting? How long? What does that mean exactly? And we work towards getting it wrapped up and that's really what we're doing right now. We are trying to wrap these up we're trying to do some bigger global settlement of maybe a law firm that has many of our insurers with its litigation to get it wrapped up quickly and as inexpensive way as possible. I can't tell you that something won't be challenged next year.  It will tell you that we've talked about it more internally because Florida PIP goes with these ebbs and flows of what happens depending on what happens with PIP perform or not. And so, we're starting to think. More with Florida PIP almost like you do a cat load in some of those other states. And because this does -- this does come more often so I can tell you is we're looking at more like that which is differently than we've done in the past. Thank you. Well if -- we have a number of what we believe will be non-renewals. And then we take it down to each customer to say, are there customers that have maybe something has changed with their home, that they've updated their roofs that we can continue to have on the books? We look to see if some of our unaffiliated partners could help if they wanted to take the customers. And it's going to take a while because there's actually a time frame with which we need to work with the Florida Department to make sure that we give a lot of notice. So you're not going to see those first non-renewals happening till May of next year. But we think it will be significant because this cohort of customers are really, really, really unprofitable.  And so we need to get there in addition to moving our footprint more towards non-volatile states. So there's a lot of work to be done before we know the exact number. We obviously have a number of where we think we start with and then we're going to try to work with our customers. We also -- we'll give the customers an opportunity to stay with Progressive if they opt into the new roof payment schedule, which is where there will be some -- a coverage options to share the cost of the replacement with us. So a lot going on there.  And no we don't do non-renewals very often it's -- and usually, you try to get the rate for it, but these customers are very unprofitable. We couldn't get enough rate to have them ever be close to profitable, and that's why we need to do that. It's never something we want to do, but as we looked at our whole portfolio and our strategy going forward, we realize this is an important piece to start as -- to start to set as ship straight. It's our original and final purchase. ASI was more of a scarcity model. And so we had platinum agents that or appointed to sell auto and home. So we have a lot of opportunity to appoint more platinum agents in the non-volatile states. So that's what we're working on right now. Thanks. Well, right now on our non-volatile states it's actually -- we have about 54%. So we have been expanding over the last several years to have less density in those states. We are purposely doing this to make sure that we can take care of the majority of that consumers. There's some like we said with the non-renewals than we can. And I think Insurance gets out. I think agents get bad because they also see the data. So for us to make sure we can protect those states, we need to make sure that we only have so much density in those states. So, for us, Florida and Texas are a big part, but still the non-volatile states are our majority of 54%. We're going to get those to 60% to 70% over the last couple -- the next couple of years. And when we look at that compared to the industry, we outperformed based on that state mix. Again, we got to change that state mix to make sure that flows through with everything. Yeah, I was going to say something. Our purposes to have -- to having a home, specifically in the agency channel, was to grow more Robinson, but it was never going to be a loss leader. It was to make money on the home and make money on the auto bundle, have great claims service. So, that hasn't changed. So, I might say we're overreacting if we did this a year ago or 2 years ago, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter, where we're struggling to make money and cats is a big part of it. Reinsurance is great, but it doesn't come without a pretty heavy cause. So we want to make sure that we use our shareholders capital the right way. And we believe this is the best way to do it. A small part of that. Great question. So we use Texas as a file-and-use state. So we put the files out there. We were able to put them on the street. They don't need to approve the filings. However, they can disapprove. They have not disapproved our filings and rather filed objections for that. Objections don't mean rejections of our rates. What that means is they want more information. So we've been working with the TDI on making sure supplement, all the information we can have to support our rate level. In fact, since April, we have done a 3-rate increases, one that's just a couple weeks ago. So, hitting into the fourth quarter, that totaled around 13%. So, we don't have our rate hearing.  In fact, they issued a notice for our July filing, but we're sending because we're trying to work back-and-forth on making sure we do the right thing. Again, we had a good long-term relationship with the TDI and we believe they're rational and they want the data to make sure they do the right thing. And if you look at the filings, there are -- we're in good Company with many of our competitors where they're asking for more information. We want to be competitive, and open and available for the people of Texas. So every state is that it could have a little nuance to it, but that, hopefully, gives you a little bit of light of Texas. Objection is just the back-and-forth of data. Yeah, but we're not going to change our model because this is in the model with some of the mutual for many years and the money they make is more on the investment side. We're still going to, with many of our competitors, we want to make a profit on the underwriting side. We want to grow as fast as we can, but we're not going to knowingly put a bunch of unprofitable business on our book. And that's why we're pulling back on advertising and during the rate increases. But again, like I said in a prior question, we believe this really positions us well for what we believe might happen as the market turns, and we'll be positioned where the shopping happens. We're going to get a lot of that business. And when that happens, we don't exactly know, but that's why we are positioning ourselves where we're at now based on the data that we see. Thanks, Tracy. Yeah, I think Sams will be able to find a price out there. In fact, I talked a little bit about new business tests being down and they're down mostly in Sams because they're one, inconsistently insured and they frequently shop because it is really about price. So yeah, I think they'll find it and then when the --the Sams is very much about price. So as those companies raise their rates, they'll come back to us. At that point, we'll be competitively priced to make a lifetime 96 on those Sams. Thanks. Yeah, we're not trying to slow the increases for retention. If we slow increases, it's because, like I talked about in California, the mechanism is more backward-looking than what we're seeing in the claims. So we will try to get the amount of rate we think we needed that time against small bites of the apple. And as we've seen more data, we'll either won't raise rates, or like last year, or reduced rates, or raise them a little bit more. But the regulator timing is really an individual conversation we're having across the country. I gave a couple of examples in Texas and California. California going to take a little bit longer, so we are going to try to reduce our growth there. But I think it's really where we priced our indications and we look at that prospectively. 31 now. 29, we've been [Indiscernible] at the cue, it's 31 by the time we have this meeting. Well, I would say I'll let Pat add what he has. And we will look at prospective need for rate increase, and that's why we're following the trend so closely. And again, they -- there -- it's so volatile based on what's been happening and it could change back and forth. So we'll continue to get that. And we will likely, at this point, if trends continue, we'll see that we'll need even more rate in the fourth quarter and probably into Q1. That's why it's important to be really nimble. And that's why I often talk about our pricing group and what we're able to get to really quickly and decisively. And if you couldn't do that, you might have to take way more rate because it's going to be a big issue to do that. But we're able to be so nimble that we can do that. Watch trends and if we need a little bit more or not, we can act accordingly. Yes. So we're meeting with the Board in December and they will ultimately make the decision on the variable dividend and what we would intend to give throughout the year. We look at all the inputs like you suggest to determine what makes sense. And that's one of the reasons why we changed the dividend policy several years ago because it can from a timing perspective be different from what we're seeing internally, from the gain share program that we aligned it with several years ago. So we're working with the board, and ultimately, it will be their decision in December on how much they believe the variable dividend will be up for this year. Thanks, Elyse. Well, we're watching closely because there's so much in play. So obviously if you look at the severity on collision, it's up 14%. And you've been watching what has happened. And as an example was the Manheim Used Car Index. I mean, even the first few weeks of October, it was up 8% over September. And then if you look at October 20 to October 21, it was up 37%. And then pre -pandemic to now, up over 50%. Some of those huge increases we've never seen, so we'll have to watch and see what happens with the supply of chips. Does that open up the supply demand of new cars and used parts? We do have -- we're off a little bit with frequency on salvage returns.  So we're going to watch that closely. What we haven't seen yet in body shops are labor rates increasing. They've been relatively flat. We'll watch that, especially when you think about talent in that area. And we have seen the labor -- I mean, parts prices up right around 5%. Some of that's inflation, and some of that is just inherently expensive parts and more expensive vehicles. So those are the things we're watching, and we have trend meetings all the time, really closely to see if this sort of inflation is transitory or baked into our system. Yes. Yeah, I think '16 was a little bit different because most of the rate we needed was on the commercial side and those are 12-month policies. I think what we've been talking about a lot in this call was regulatory, just some of the objections. It might take a little longer with those dates as we provide more data. But we expect to, as we have in the past, be in that position in that 6-month timeframe, hopefully sooner. Thank you. It's on improvement of margins and where we're at with the data we have now that we do look at those prospectively but if we believe we need more and I think the question that Brian just asked makes a lot of sense if we're watching some of the inflationary trends and will launch those closely as we believe we will need those and we'll get more. Yeah, I would add that -- so do I. I gave the percentages of what happened with used cars and, obviously, the things that would happen with supply chain. I think the industry overall, missed that because who would have ever thought used parts will go up to that extent. So that -- those are just some of the things we're catching up, and Gary, that 6% was in 20 states? Yes. Thank you."

            "content": "I would add briefly that the other thing that could influence countrywide conversion is the mix of quotes we're getting across geographies. So with direct advertising, you have the ability to generate quotes at a very local level. And if we have concerns on profitability in an area where we previously had higher conversion, we will shut off or reduce the ad spend in that area, and that would then show the decrease in conversion just by that mix change. When we're adjusting ads spend at the local level, you can see changes in conversion in total simply by that mix. So rate is one thing for sure but interestingly on the direct side, you can also influence conversion based on your marketing spend. The one thing I would add to that is that, you talked about the new business penalty. Of course, as Tricia mentioned, on direct business, there's a huge expense load difference. So as we're writing few hundred customers that flows through an advertising spend as well. So there's certainly a benefit on spending less and getting fewer new customers in the direct set, in terms of costs. In terms of loss ratio, we see a bigger differential between new and renewal on the Sam end of the spectrum than on the Robinson end of the spectrum. So to the extent we are reducing Sam's coming through the door relative to Robinson's, it would it would have a bigger benefit on the loss ratio side.  So there's some of that coming through, but you also have to recognize that our book is heavily, heavily weighted to renewal customers, so it can have some benefit. But in aggregate, we need the benefit of the rate flowing through the book, the new and renewal customers. It's going to flow through renewals sooner, and there's far less elasticity in the renewal book. So you will see average premiums rising sooner and more likely on the renewal side. On the new side, customers are shopping, and it's a highly elastic market. We'll see some of that rate. We'll see a little slower, or we'll probably see a little less of it simply because there are other options in the marketplace. And we move faster than others when it comes to taking rate when we need it.  So we think, and we've seen historically at least, that competitors are seeing the same trends we are. They will need the same price changes. It may take them longer. So we might see a bit imbalance on the new business front for a while. But again, our experiences, competitors see the same thing, they catch up, and by the time they do, we're in a very good position and very confident in growing more and turning advertising back up and the other growth levers we have. And while we -- we don't know exactly how many customers we'll have to, now, renew, and as Tricia said, we're trying to work with customers for options to stay with us. You should think of a very low single-digit percentage of our policies enforced countrywide. But this is not a huge shift, but it's a shift, as Tricia was saying, geographically. So while we want to reduce our footprint in the volatile space, we want to grow in the less volatile space. So in aggregate, our objective is still to grow. It's simply to grow in different areas. We're just -- we're not only reacting to the results. We've been digging harder into the modeling and looking at our exposure for what they could best look like even after reinsurance. So while we are heavily reinsured and we're pretty [indiscernible] relative to our total insured value, especially those cut states, there are still potential scenarios. And that's what we're trying to manage. The tail risk is still there. We haven't seen it. But we want to be proactive in managing that, so that we don't see that down the road. I want to offer -- one point of clarification and a little more color. One is that we've heard twice people say we took 6 points of rate in the third quarter. We actually took 3 in our Personal Auto. We took 6 points in about half the country, which gets you to 3 -- 5 year-to-date. And we're going to continue to take rates. So whenever you're taking rate, you are either or both, catching up from what you didn't see when you first priced or you're pricing for the future. So in a perfect world you're just always pricing for the future, and your previous pricing was perfect. That's normally not the case.  You're either a little higher or a little low on your previous pricing. So some of that adjustment is catching up in this environment. It's catching up, frankly. But it is also looking forward as to what we believe frequency and severity trends will be for the coming life of that rate revision be at 6, 12 months. So I just wanted to clarify on what we've taken year-to-date and we say it is -- to some degree catching up, but to a large degree, ensuring we have a very adequate rates on the street going into 2022, so that we're very confident to turn on more advertising and other growth levers."

And I think we're now in 29 states -- 31 now. Thank you. Yeah. Our property exposure at this juncture, Commercial Lines is very minimal. We aspire to have far bigger share of that business.

            "content": "And one thing that I would add on top, John, and I think you mentioned it, but it's not about shrinking our book in the volatile states. It's about accelerating growth in the less volatile states while we have a period of time where we're investing in product segmentation, and as Tricia mentioned, product features that risk share with our customers. So don't think of it as abandoning the property business in any way, shape, or form. It's a temporary acceleration of growth in less volatile states until we get to a more comfortable balance between volatile and less volatile. No. Typically, it will reset a clock. So some states will have a dimmer provision where there's not an objection filed, than it will be deemed approved after a certain date. But the ongoing especially in preserving great relationships with our regulators, if there's open questions we want to be transparent and provide them the data they need to do their jobs. Well the competitive environment that we operate in has some pretty different business models. So whether you have a mutual structure or a stock Company as two good examples, and as a result, there's different motivating factors, different profit objectives, different targets. So while we can't comment on specific area or action, we operate our business to deliver, as Tricia said, the $0.04, and grow as fast as we can. And that may mean that our growth is a little lumpier, but our profitability is generally pretty consistent. We fully expect as rates go up that will create shopping and we enjoy. We believe a larger share of the shoppers than we do of that overall market. So generally, that's been good for us when there is a hardening market that create shopping. We benefit because we're broadly distributed and try to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for and buy insurance. Yeah. No, I think that's exactly it. Over the lifetime of these customers, we do expect to hit our targets, and we do price to a lifetime model. Additionally, there's value in selling other products to these customers and establishing a relationship with them now. Even if they may not be priced completely to target, it's not a bad thing for the long-term health and growth of the business. Yeah. The one thing I would add is there's just acceleration in our rate takes. So the 5% of the year-to-date number and as Tricia mentioned in Q3, in half the country, we increased rates about 6% cut 3 in that period. So there's 6 months of the year before we saw the real frequency recovery that we were still lowering rates, frankly. And that's factored in there. Correct. Yeah. We price to our expected cost. And as far out as we can see, the effective date of our revision or the average date of that revision. we're setting our prices based on where we expect trend to be. If trend continues to accelerate, we'll continue to take rate. If trend ameliorates, we'll slow our rate take and not file for additional increases. And that's the key for individual consumers, right? That they get a small increase at renewal which doesn't prompt them to shop as opposed to somebody that waits. And if they wait 6 months or 12 months. And at that point in 88 points or rate are something higher, it creates shopping in your book that's just not healthy, frankly, for the health of the overall book."

I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be your moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter marks the return to our typical format, which is a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions-and-answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first and second quarters of 2021. We will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website @investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments, Trisha.\nTricia Griffith: Let me set the stage for this session. As a reminder, these are construct we call the four cornerstones. This construct allows us to focus and make investments that drive value to the organization and all of our constituents; who we are, which are our five core values. Peter Lewis wrote these back in 1987 and they have served us well over the decades. Specifically during this past year and a half as we've navigated completely foreign waters and have made decisions on behalf of all of our constituents, we have used our core values as a guide. I won't go into all that we did because I've publicly written about much of it but suffice it to say we believe all along the way, we did the right thing. Why we're here? Our purpose statement, which is true to our name, Progressive. We believe this statement is about forward progress, innovation and never resting on our past performance, where we're headed, our vision, which is to become consumers and agents number one choice and [Technical Difficulty] assurance needs with us now and as those needs evolve. We know that we must earn their trust every day in order to achieve this vision. How we'll get there? Our strategy, and more specifically our four strategic pillars, which is how we think explicitly about investing to ultimately achieve our vision. I'll briefly give you a high-level overview of how we think about each pillar. People and culture, our goal is to ensure our people and culture collectively remain our most powerful source of competitive advantage, including attracting and hiring new talent, retain the people we have and developing everyone. So that we can all have long and prosperous careers. We will support our people and culture by ensuring our people can bring their whole selves to work through our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Broad needs, we will meet the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetimes by being available where, when and how our customers want to interact with us, helping our customers select the best insurance for their current needs, as well as their evolving insurable needs throughout their lifetime. Leading brand, we will maintain the leading brand recognized for innovative offerings and supported by experiences that instill confidence with messages that resonate. Competitive pricing, we will offer competitive prices by pricing rate to risk through our industry leading segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy and claims and finding ways to continually drive costs down through process changes in technology advances. Our agenda will be in three sections and we'll cover the commercial auto market and trends in the industry, including our performance relative to the market. We'll do a market overview that will outline our long-term growth plans, and finally an update on market capabilities and expanding our product offering. Before we begin our deep dive commercialize agenda, I do want to acknowledge that we're highly cognizant of the fact that we reported a 100.5 combined ratio for June and are and have been taking steps to ensure profitability as we come out of the pandemic. Commercial lines is a huge opportunity for Progressive. So I don't want to draw attention away from the very important agenda Karen and Jochen Schunter have for you upcoming by offering prepared comments on results. I expect we'll have the opportunity in Q&A to share steps we've taken and are in the process of undertaking to ensure we achieve our calendar year 96 or better underwriting margin objective. Let's kick off the first section by talking about the addressable market. When we began these webcasts many years back, we started with showing the property and casualty addressable market and we discussed our plans for both personal lines and commercial lines. Our commercial lines offerings have evolved over time and of course, we recently acquired Protective Insurance. So we thought this was a good time to give you a more detailed update. To summarize the entire market, you'll see in the center of the slide that the total property and casualty market is 730 billion. The Progressive share 5.7% is reflected in both the blue section of the doughnut and the blue percentages. The gray reflects the industry. On the personal line side, we have a 9.6% of the 366 billion market split between personal auto at 12.9% share and homeowners at 1.7% share. We've had massive growth here but still plenty of room to grow. The commercial lines addressable market is 364 billion and includes a wide array of opportunities. The commercial auto opportunity alone is a $46 billion market, where we hold the number one position with plenty of room to grow at 12.1% share with a large other commercial addressable market of 318 billion. At this point in time, the market that we believe we can both play and win in is approximately 78 billion. If you start near the top of the circle and go clockwise, that entails monoline commercial auto, small fleet, transportation network companies, commercial auto bundled with GL and BOP, small business with GL and BOP, medium and large fleet with Protective and workers comp with Protective. The addressable markets that we aren't currently in include public transportation, larger commercial multi-peril businesses with over 20 employees and products like mortgage guarantee and marine just to name a few. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and that we started investing in many years ago to set us up for future growth. We've shared these two-by-two charts a few times. As a reminder, the X axis is the combined ratio on an inverted scale, so you want to be to the right of 100. The Y axis is net written premium growth, so you want to be above the black line showing positive growth. Together, you want to be in the top right hand shaded area where we're growing market share at or below a 96 combined ratio. The blue dot is Progressive, the black dot is the industry and the gray dots are the others in the top 10 each year since 2015 through 2020. As we reflect in the past six years, we've consistently been in that area, growing market share and achieving at least a 96 combined ratio. In fact, on both profitability and growth, we frequently beat the industry in any individual competitor by wide margins. I'd like to get into the meat of their program. But before I do that, I'll give some background on our speakers. I think many of you have met Karen before. Karen Bailo is our Commercial Lines President. She's been with Progressive for over 30 years with her most recent role as General Manager of Acquisition and Small Business Insurance. Karen has held several other significant leadership positions including personal lines GM, commercial lines controller, and most notably, she spent nine years building our agency distribution, organization, and positioned Progressive as a preferred supplier in that channel. Karen started her career in customer service as a management trainee and like others on our executive team, she was a claims rep early in her Progressive career. A graduate of the University of South Carolina, Karen earned a bachelor's degree in psychology with a minor in Statistics, and she went on to earn an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. Jochen Schunter began his career in Progressive in 2006, after moving to Cleveland, Ohio from Southern Germany. He's an alumnus of both the University of Dayton where he earned an MBA and of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, where he earned bachelor's and master's degree in the arts. After doing rounds in both the accounting and Alice rotational programs at Progressive, Jochen joined commercial lines in 2008. He started out in various pricing and control functions and then moved into product management. First, he managed several states including California and our market entry into Hawaii and then took on big responsibilities as the leader of our truck product. During his tenure, he significantly contributed to increasing our market share by rolling out numerous product enhancements and also improving segmentation. Now as Commercial Line Controller, Jochen leads the organization responsible for ensuring we run a profitable business. This includes strategy and performance monitoring, risk analysis, data and analytics, rate setting compliance and recovery as well as finance and accounting. I'll now hand it over to Karen to outline our commercial lines trends.\nKaren Bailo: We'll be sharing a number of charts and graphs to highlight our business performance during this presentation. While our June results include Protective based on our closing date of June 1. For the purposes of this presentation unless otherwise stated, the numbers exclude Protective. I'd like to begin with a look at our performance relative to the industry. This is a 20-year time series of Progressive commercial auto net written premium growth rate versus the rest of the industry. During this time period, our results have really diverged from the industry. There are a couple of observations around growth that I'd like to highlight. First, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and tends to move with the larger economy. And second, when the market grows Progressive has historically grown at a faster pace. In fact, since 2016, we've doubled the business and gained almost four points of market share. And that equates to more than 20% compounded growth rate and achieving more than 12% market share. The more significant divergence from the market has been an underwriting profit. We've outperformed the industry by 8 to 10 and as much as 20 points over those 20 years. Our objective is to grow as fast as we can at target combined ratios. And we've had a track record of success and outperformed the industry on both growth and profit over those 20 years. There's a number of contributing factors. But perhaps most important has been the intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. We've shared this information in the past and wanted to provide a brief refresher on how we approach our auto business. We segment our business into what we refer to as business market targets and we introduced these business market targets for commercial auto in 2014. Since introduced by BMTs are now operationalized across virtually every aspect of our business. That's important because we see meaningful and actionable differences between these BMTs. For example, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function responds to changes in different economic conditions is different. We also see that losses present differently and how they develop, attorney representation rates and litigation outcomes differ by BMT. Certainly frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT, all of which are critical inputs to determining rate level. This granular focus allows us to develop insights faster, be more responsive with strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. I want to talk about what we're observing in shopping, loss trends and how we're positioned for continued success. We have the benefit of over 10 billion miles of driving data with our telematics data. This chart shows patterns in driving miles highway congestion and highway speeding pre- and post-pandemic. You can see that as stay at home orders were issued, there was a significant decrease in miles driven and congestion on the highway. At the same time, there was an increase in highway speeding. Now while the impact from COVID on small businesses was severe, when we look at our business class level data, it's also clear that different businesses were affected differently. For example, in the truck space, fully a third of our smart haul customers saw their mileage increase, while about 8% were shut down completely. Landscapers and most construction trades were still working and other service businesses were not. Looking at more recent trends, while we see mileage and congestion back to pre-COVID levels, speeding events haven't dropped back to where they were. This raises the question around whether COVID brought a permanent change to truckers driving habits and it's something we'll keep a close eye on in the months to come. In addition to our own data, we look to other macro economic trends to develop a deeper understanding of shopping and small business trends, especially during challenging economic conditions. This chart shows our insurance shopping trends in this case, agency quote growth, for businesses that tie to goods and services sectors index to 2019. Progressive quote data is in the solid line and consumer spend data is in the dotted line. Our experience tracks closely to the rate of consumer spending on goods and services. So this is data we have and we'll continue to monitor. The macroeconomic data shows spending on goods recovered more quickly, while the services sector has lagged and has been more depressed relative to good sectors. Some of that is because services sectors were more affected by stay at home orders and good spending has been supported by federal government stimulus. That intuitively makes sense and we see that in our underlying data. Businesses that were considered more essential, plumbing or sanitation services are those that tied to the transportation of goods, like agriculture, hauling or livestock hauling responded differently versus those that are tied to services industries, like airport shuttles, food trucks and entertainers. The positive news is that as the service businesses reopen, we're seeing a recovery in spending toward 2019 levels. This increase in spending on services should drive a rebound in insurance shopping for businesses related to that sector. Again, food trucks, restaurant delivery airport shuttles just to name a few. In summary, different businesses have been affected differently. And this is important in terms of how we think about trends, the implications for frequency and severity and ultimately rate level going forward. In our last update in 2019, we shared a historical perspective that provides a good illustration of how we will approach today's environment. Back in 2016, we saw a marked increase in frequency between May and November, at the same time, some prior year reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We responded quickly to address those trends raising rates by more than 10% and made a series of underwriting changes in about three months. And we've continued with a series of changes and adjustments since. Fast forward to recent trends, you can clearly see the impact of COVID on frequency. We saw a sharp decline in frequency as stay at home orders went into effect. And as I shared earlier, driving miles from our usage-based insurance data shows driving miles and congestion levels are back to pre-pandemic levels. And the services sectors are also rebounding. Given all of those conditions, we're seeing loss frequency rising relative to COVID lows when frequency fell dramatically. And at the same time, we continue to see a steady increase in severity trends that we've been accounting for in our rate level indications. Given the variation and how businesses were affected by the pandemic, some slowing down and other seeing an increase in business. We have been and plan to continue to be cautious in our actions. We haven't lowered rates and we've been conservative in our pricing and underwriting decisions. The trends we're observing now are lining up with what's forecasted in our rate level indications. We've planned for frequency recovery and a continued steep severity trend and have kept pace with net trends with a combined rate increase of 29% from the beginning of 2016 through the first half of this year. The additional segmentation we've built into the product over the last five years has proven effective and driven better than industry underwriting results and growth. And I would suggest having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see while much of the market is slower to react has been an important part of maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business over the years. So we continue to advance our product segmentation and underwriting capabilities and we plan to continue to respond appropriately to loss trends going forward. I'd like to shift to a discussion on expenses and efficiency. Now we know from experience that companies that can achieve a lower cost structure gained share at a greater rate than the overall industry. We've seen that in the personal lines market and believe it matters in the commercial lines market as well. The correlation of efficiency aiding and growth isn't lost on us and we're well positioned on this chart. Now 2020 results show that we're nearly 11 points lower than the industry average in LAE and expense ratio. In a very price sensitive industry that 11 point advantage is significant. But there's a balance. We don't necessarily want to be the lowest because we believe in also investing in what matters, quality outcomes for customers that earn loyalty and investments that foster great work environments for our employees. To that end, I'd like to highlight where we're making investments to improve on both those fronts. This is a view of our expense ratio track record over a 10-year time period. And over that time period, we've seen a 7 to 8-point expense advantage compared to the industry. That advantage was 6 points in 2020 due in part because COVID credits flowed through expenses rather than premium, resulting in a slight elevated expense ratio. While we've had an expense advantage over this time period, we're prioritizing initiatives to extend our leadership position. There are a number of levers that drive expense ratio advantages and while we don't have enough time for a comprehensive review of all the efforts underway, I wanted to share with you two examples that demonstrate active cost management efforts to drive expense reductions and improve experiences at the same time. These both highlight our focus in managing expenses related to our growth and improving our operational efficiency. We maintain a disciplined focus on managing overhead and growth in headcount as we grow the business. This chart is designed to represent a few things. The solid blue line represents overall net earned premium growth. The solid orange line represents employee costs and real estate costs are represented in the solid black line. You can see that while employee costs and real estate costs have gone up, they've grown at a lower rate relative to net earned premium. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One is being disciplined and judicious in decisions to increase staff. We've added the dotted lines here to represent volume driven and non-volume driven employee growth. And while we've grown, our volume driven counts in line with our net earned premium pace, we've been very targeted in adding non-volume driven resources and our non-volume driven employee count has grown at a much lower rate. This discipline has resulted in growing our total employee costs, the orange line less than net earned premium growth. The second is related to real estate, like personal lines prior to the pandemic, our customer and agent services organization enabled real estate expense savings by implementing a home-based consultant model. This model has a number of benefits. It provides broader access to talent and improved our ability to increase staff to support our growing business, especially last year and it's also provided flexibility that employees value. In addition, this model allows us to grow our business without a commensurate growth in space. In 2019, almost 40% of our commercial lines agents and customer services consultants were working from home. Now we're still working through our plans as we transition back to the office post-pandemic. We expect the portion of our customer and agent services consultants that work from home to grow materially as people make the decision to remain working from home going forward. This will support our ability to grow without significantly growing our real estate footprint. The second example of our cost management efforts highlights investments in systems and technology to deliver the products and services our agents and customers value, while focusing on increasing operational efficiency. We've been investing significantly in systems to support our core auto business and in expanding our business with our BOP product and direct small business capabilities. Despite significant investments in technology and systems, we've been able to maintain our expense advantage. Now we acknowledge and expected this relatively short-term increase in technology costs to lower our costs in the long run with gains and efficiency and new lines of business. Now improving efficiency to push our expense advantage is a key objective. Two examples of progress are shown here. We've shared in previous annual report commentary that we're transitioning to a new policy administration system. And this new system is a significant driver of our technology expenses and rolling out the new system is a big part of our ability to drive more efficiency. The new system introduces more modern functionality that enables faster delivery of our products and enhancements and the ability to improve customer experiences and self-service capabilities. The initial launch of this new system in a state brings consumer online buy capabilities. The chart on the left shows the total lift in direct online sales yield with our new system. Now completely isolating the effects of the online buy capabilities is difficult but we're seeing an 80% improvement in online sales yield after introducing this new system. And that would translate to more than a 20% increase in direct auto sales. Now, while direct is still a relatively small portion of our business, we expect this added functionality to bring long-term economic benefit to us in terms of improved sales yield and lower acquisition costs for that part of our business and that's very important as this business grows. A second way we're gaining efficiency is via process automations. On the right is a representation of improvements that we've already made reducing the manual work associated with millions of documents we receive every year via fax, email or paper mail. Until recently, each document had to be manually reviewed and categorized for action either to be attached to a policy and sent directly to storage or put in queue for additional processing. Over half of these documents are in that first group. They don't require any action beyond archival. We have a project underway to automate that workflow by the end of the year using optical character recognition technology to review those documents automatically and attach them to a policy and send them to storage without human intervention and this reset resources to focus on other more value-added work. These are just two examples to illustrate how we will focus future investments. Now while we're pleased with our early progress, we're just getting started. And we have a robust roadmap ahead of us that will target more efficiency improvements and self-service capabilities designed to meet customer and agents expectations. Investments in product, experiences and more efficient workflows combined should enable us to reduce the drivers of costs to service our customers. We anticipate that by lowering our costs, we will be able to further extend our expense advantage and position as well for any market conditions. Now moving on to the other part of our expense advantage. We believe our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. We've doubled the core auto business while maintaining very competitive loss adjustment expense ratios and good quality. Our claims advantage comes from a surgical focus on claims accuracy and efficiency. And back in 2019, we shared how our claims organization leverages the scale of our broader personal lines claims organization with a focus on specialization for high impact and complex claims. We continue to push commercialized specialization as we grow our business. And we also see significant potential in leveraging technology and analytics to increase productivity and claims handling segmentation along with improving accuracy. I wanted to share a brief example to illustrate how we're leveraging data, data science and advanced analytics to monitor and react to claims activity and exposure changes. The image on this slide represents a homegrown tool developed to inform leaders of claims that need review. The tool is powered by a file intervention program that uses analysis and data science to populate the tool and is designed to improve leaders focus on at risk files. This helps improve claims accuracy through better coaching and supports timely claim handling efforts. We know handling delays can result in unfavorable outcomes and the alerts are prioritized and trigger on the best date for the leader to intervene for the most favorable results. In this example, you see a code FS13 with a description potential for delayed total loss resolution. In this example, an alert triggered on March 19, with a message indicating a potential delay in resolving a total loss settlement. The leader intervenes by providing guidance to the claim rep on the open activity on the file. And since the leader intervened, the trigger is programmed to return two days later to make sure the claim rep is following up on the guidance provided. The next alert triggers on March 21. The leader reviews the file and sees that the claim rep followed up on the direction provided so no additional intervention is needed at this point in time. The leader indicates no to the intervention question in the lower left and once no intervention is selected and alert is programmed to return eight days later if the total loss is still not resolved. In this case, the total loss resolved on March 25. And so the alert didn't return for the third time. This is a powerful tool that helps our claims teams efficiently run the business of claims and contributes to more timely and accurate claims handling. A final point on our performance relative to the industry is related to reserving where our philosophy is to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation. This chart shows our commercial auto reserved development versus the industry. We have a much tighter variance and we see two primary reasons for this. One contributing factor is the claims organization we just talked about. Leveraging technology and advanced analytics to increase productivity and get the right claims to the right resource more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better outcomes. The other contributing factor is the highly segmented approach we take to loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. We've operationalized that BMT structure, in addition to the usual loss cost cuts and it allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. Having more consistent and predictable loss cost estimates through accurate reserving, lets us understand our true ultimate cost faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. So that's a little background on what we've been seeing in our commercial auto results recently and why we've been able to produce some different outcomes relative to the industry. I'd now like to turn it over to Jochen Schunter who will share a little about our plans for extending our leadership in commercial auto, including how and where protective insurance fits into those plans.\nJochen Schunter: Thank you, Karen. I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our commercial auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make. Let me start by talking a little bit about our two telematics programs that we have in market today. Smart Haul and Snapshot ProView. We're proud to say that we have recently surpassed $500 million of commercial auto premium in force from these telematics based programs and that we've analyzed over 10 billion miles of data. Smart Haul is our truck focused telematics program that leverages the data from federally mandated electronic logging devices or ELD for short, through the federal mandate most over the road truckers need an ELD to managed hours of service. Smart Haul uses driving data from a trucker's existing ELD in exchange for a discount on the insurance of up to 18%. And while conversion is nearly double our normal truck conversion, we continue to see a sizable loss ratio advantage for this book even after applying those steep discounts, which average about $1500 per policy. It's clear this is good business and it's all incremental and verifiable segmentation that we're able to apply at point-of-sale. To demonstrate how powerful the segmentation has proven to be, I'd like to draw your attention to the chart on the left. Telematics is the most predictive variable in our for-hire transportation segment. The depicted bar includes the power of new variables enabled by telematics in addition to variables that can be derived from telematics, such as territory ozone. As you can see, telematics is by far our most predictive rating variable, and we have plans to further evolve the model by adding even more predictiveness to it. Our continued research of driving data is allowing us to constantly evolve and improve the model. Switching over to our other telematics program, Snapshot ProView. We have a program that provides discounts and complimentary fleet management features to our non ELD customers. While this program is much younger, we already see the segmentation power of telematics, especially in segments where driving patterns vary significantly from risk-to-risk. The chart on the slide shows an average drive time for select business classes and a variance around that average. Let's pick the restaurant business class as an example, we have insureds that used a vehicle close to five hours a day, likely to deliver food. At the same time, we have restaurants that used our vehicle less than one hour a day, you can imagine lost cost may look very different for those two used cases. That's just one example how telematics data can help us create new segmentation as we create new insights from the 10 billion miles of collected data. Next, I'd like to highlight some of the most significant milestones we've been able to achieve in commercial auto over the years that we're especially proud of. First, in 2008, we became the largest writer of truck insurance in the United States. In 2015, we became the number one writer of commercial auto overall. In 2019, we became the number one writer of preferred truck in the non-fleet space, I'll talk more about that in a minute. And lastly, this year we passed $6 billion in net written premium making us more than two times the size of our next closest competitor based on trailing 12-month statutory data. As mentioned on the prior slide, we've made big strides in growing our preferred truck book enabling us to become the number one writer of non-fleet preferred truck in 2019. We define preferred truck as motor carriers that have a track record of being financially responsible with three or more years in business and a strong safety record. Based on our analysis, we grew our estimated share of non-fleet preferred truck from 5.9% in January of 2016 to 15.4% in May of 2021. On a direct written premium basis that reflects an annual growth rate of 29.5% over that same five-year time period. We did so by launching product enhancements that improved our competitiveness, while hitting our annual calendar year profit targets each of those yields. Those investments have helped us improve consideration amongst the most preferred trackers shopping for insurance. In fact, of all the non-fleet preferred motor carriers that require our federal filing that switched insurance carriers in 2021 without a lapse in coverage, we got quoted on 48.2% of them. That number is up from 35.3% in Q1 of 2016. With this success, we continue to pursue a robust roadmap to enhance our product and coverage offerings, along with improved segmentation, allowing us to offer even lower rates for the best service. Another exciting opportunity to grow our business across all BMTs is targeted at businesses with 10 to 40 vehicles. The small fleet market is about a $7 billion market, where we have low penetration and only began increasing our focus on and investing in over the last couple of years. As we increased our focus, we saw opportunities to improve our pricing and add fleet specific segmentation to provide more competitive rates to the best fleet risks. In addition, we expanded our underwriting team to support new underwriting capabilities, ensure appropriate pricing and accelerate the underwriting process. Today, we have the segmentation, assets and capabilities to compete effectively in this attractive market. As you can see, on the left chart, we've been able to more than triple our fleet book over the last five years with a meaningful acceleration in the last year. The right funnel chart shows the impact of improvements we've been able to elevate just in the last year driving that growth. While we've been able to increase quotes by 19% in the trailing 12 months, we've been able to increase find the book quotes by 85% and ultimately sales by 92%. Let me cover some of the specific improvements that have allowed us to achieve those results. First, we brought and continued to bring automation and technology to the quoting process helping us to increase efficiency. Specifically, we've automated the review of the supplemental application intake of this data into our database, underwriting review processes and related agent follow-up. We've also been able to improve the quote turnaround time by simplifying the quote process and leveraging our distribution organization to educate agents which in turn is driving agent engagement, more completed quotes and increased conversion. With our continued investments, we believe we're well positioned to continue our growth into small fleet space. Talking about investments in small fleet that's a great transition to highlight our plans to move even further upstream in the fleet markets. That's where our recent acquisition of Protective insurance fits in. Before we get to talking about how Protective will help us grow fleets, let's spend a few minutes and talk about Protective, the products Protective offers and customers they serve. Let's start with some background, Protective insurance is located in Carmel, Indiana, employing about 500 people. The company has nearly 100 years of experience of providing innovative insurance solutions primarily for the fleet trucking operations. Protective operates several statutory insurance companies which are collectively licensed in all 50 states. While Protective will benefit from Progressive strong balance sheet and financial strength. Progressive will benefit from many of Protective's unique capabilities, allowing it to successfully serve the fleet market. Let's talk about some of those capabilities and the Protective product suite. Protective sales many of the lines we're very familiar with, including commercial auto physical damage, commercial auto liability, non-trucking liability, cargo and general liability. In addition and very critical to fleets coverage needs, Protective office workers comp and occupational accident to coverages that are very additive to Progressive suffering. In fact, workers comp reflects the largest statutory commercial coverage in terms of premium, even bigger than commercial auto. As mentioned on the prior slide, this is done through a variety of statutory entities and distribution channels. Next, let's cover what customers protect themselves. While we just talked about Progressive's number one position in truck overhaul, it's important to note that we've achieved that position primarily by dominating the less than 10 vehicle space. Only recently have we begun investing into our fleet product, becoming competitive for fleets of up to 40 total vehicles inclusive of trails. We're early in that journey and while we've hit some major milestones and seen some encouraging growth, we realize that they are needed capabilities we would have to build to effectively compete for medium and large fleets. Protective delivers those capabilities allowing us to move upstream. Those include sophisticated risk retention mechanisms, allowing fleets to participate in the risk and indemnity, safety and loss control programs along with underwriting expertise, and lastly rating by mileage and revenue. Independent contractors in the FedEx affinity program are amongst many of Protective's other customers engaged in the rapidly growing last mile delivery space, a sector we expect to continue to expand over the coming years. Switching to profitability, Protective has had a long track record of generating excellent results meeting their respective profit targets over decades. Similarly to Progressive in doing so they were able to outperform the commercial auto industry consistently. While the last few years have been challenged from a profitability perspective, we strongly believe that the right actions have been taken to return to those industry leading combined ratios. Specifically Protective has refocused on its core business which is transportation insurance. In addition, significant rate was taken to account for the industry steep severity trends. We believe this focus on core products and retake already proving to be successful with the last few quarters showing constant improvement of underwriting results. In addition, Protective has reinsurance in place to protect from significant adverse development from prior accident years. Those reinsurance treaties ensure that retains severities and tails are consistent with Progressive's established risk appetite. Finally, I'd like to talk about how Protective is additive to Progressive's product offering and allows us to expand our addressable market. Clearly, while we're both heavily focused on the commercial auto line, we do so with minimal overlap. Progressive is the market leader in the small transportation space. While Protective is a leader in the medium and large transportation fleet space. Together, we're able to serve that market in its entirety and with Protective's workers comp capabilities, we're able to establish a foothold into that critical coverage. The coverage that is considered an anchor product in the small, medium and large fleet space. We look forward to further complementing each other's product offering enabling both entities to grow market share collectively. Lastly, while we're still early in this acquisition, we look forward to what we call preserve and learn for the remainder of the year. Before focusing on further integrating all commercial offerings under the Progressive commercial lines umbrella. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that we intend to maintain the Carmel, Indiana operation. This acquisition has always been about growing addressable markets, and therefore revenue collectively beyond what each of us would be able to achieve individually. With that, I'd like to go back to a slide Tricia shared earlier. This slide shows our addressable market, which has grown to $78 billion with this acquisition, which reflects an increase of more than 25%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Karen who will cover our investments in the Small Business Insurance space.\nKaren Bailo: Efforts to meet the broader needs of small business owners are focused on building products and capabilities to support our agency business and to meet the growing demand in the direct channel. We believe customer choice is important and our goal is to continue to work toward customers having options for how they shop for insurance with us. Our plans include both adding products we develop ourselves, as well as offering other carrier products in our in-house agency. In our experience, developing products ourselves works best in our agency business and we will continue to focus on investments that enable us to continue to grow and succeed with our agents. We're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. In addition to developing our own products, we're offering other carrier products through our in-house agency. That approach is working well for us and it will remain a part of our strategy for that part of our business. In the end, expanding our product offering is all about having a broad enough product portfolio that agents and customers never have to look elsewhere for their insurance needs. In 2019, we expanded our product offering with our own business owners policy and general liability product. This line of business opens up our addressable market with a product that fits with our customer set and creates an opportunity to extend relationships with our customers. Similar to commercial auto, our goal is to have a streamlined intuitive quote flow and competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. We initially limited our appetite to the first five categories in this table, they are big enough to matter, allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills and allow for a straightforward streamlined quoting and binding process. We've since added a sixth BMT lessors risk. We've limited our appetite in this category to those commercial rental properties that meet our underwriting criteria in the other five. The six categories depicted on this screen account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the U.S. with fewer than 20 employees. As we did last year with lessors risk, we will continue to expand the categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Today, this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to add real value in small business insurance. We chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and have designed the products systems and experience to succeed with agents. At the same time, we kept an eye on requirements for the digital channel. And last year introduced our product in our in-house agency and our online quoting platform for small business owners. We officially launched our product in May of 2019 and finished the year with four states. Last year, all things considered, we finished strong launching 13 new states and introduced an updated product model. And building on the momentum from 2020, we launched four additional states through the end of the second quarter and four more in July. So we're now in states representing just over 50% of the commercial multi-peril market. And we expect to roll out another nine to 10 states this year and that would result in a state footprint that represents about 67% of the commercial multi-peril market. Feedback we've received from our agents supports our assessment that we have an easy to use quoting and underwriting experience and competitive products. We're happy with our momentum and we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our progress where we can continue to grow profitably. I mentioned earlier that we're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier products and we're having terrific success and growing our direct to small commercial business. In September of 2018, we introduced Business Quote Explorer, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. With that edition, consumers have a full range of options for how to shop for their small business insurance with us. Going forward we will work to optimize the experience in both of these paths. There will be times when the self-directed online path is the best option for a customer and others when calling in for phone support will be the best option. We're happy with this approach as a strategy to meet the demand from consumers who are coming to us directly for their small business insurance needs. Our small business direct efforts are going well. We've been selling direct to commercial insurance for more than a decade and have made investments in assets and capabilities to meet the growing demand from commercial prospects as well as our own customers. Now pandemic-related shopping patterns do appear to be accelerating the move to online shopping in commercial insurance and we're well positioned for that move. Our marketing efforts are maturing and generating demand and we have a good stable of carriers including our own manufactured BOP and GL product and we've got an easy-to-use quoting platform. As a result of our investments and an increase in online shopping growth has accelerated considerably. And with the investments we're making to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate growth within the small business direct channel. Now the ultimate goal is to extend relationships with our customers and provide more reasons to stay. We know customers who have more products with us retain longer. When looking at our business auto and contractor commercial auto customers with multiple products, we see that those with another personal lines product stay with us 5% to 7% longer and those with a BOP product stay about 11% longer. Now we expect policy life expectancy to further extend with more targeted efforts to grow our multi-product customers. Beyond launching new products like our BOP and GL product, we're also working to make it easier to bundle more with us. Our aspirations include making it easier to purchase multiple products across commercial lines and personal lines that new business and to add products as insurance needs grow. You've heard us describe our aspirations of relationships with our customers lasting for decades or longer. We're making significant progress and expect over time our commercial relationships will contribute to increasing the number of customers that have chosen to stay with Progressive for a decade or longer. This is all part of our broader vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we're excited to have considerable under penetrated addressable market in front of us, where we have the people, skills and assets to succeed. Thanks for your time today. And now we'll move on to the Q&A portion of our session.\nDoug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions including Karen Bailo and Jochen Schunter who can answer questions about our commercial lines presentation. The Q&A session will be audio only. To submit a question or online audience can use the Ask a Question tab located at the top right of the webcast, phone participants can press star one on your keypad. In order to get as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will now take our first question from the phone.\nOperator: Our first question coming from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question. I believe there's been some regulatory pushback, in some states including Nevada, Texas and Ohio to some rates that you guys have filed for. So how does Progressive respond to the situations where you're not getting the rates that you need?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. This is Tricia. We respond with data. So we have data that is showing on steep trends and severity and our need to get rates on the street. And we provide that and try to work with our regulators to get those push through. In the long run, we want to make sure we're available for consumers. And we can only be available if we're able to reach our objective of growing as fast as we can. But more importantly, at a 96 combined ratio or less. So we continue to work with regulators, we've had some good success in Texas, as you mentioned, every state has little nuances. But we're going to continue to work side-by-side to do the right things for our collective consumers and customers.\nElyse Greenspan: And then, in the presentation that we just heard, I believe you guys were talking about, seeing beating at higher levels and not going back to like pre-pandemic levels. I don't know is specific to commercial auto. But it sounds like that's perhaps something we're seeing within commercial and personal auto. So do you think that this is a new normal? Because if there's higher levels of speeding, right, and there could be much more severe accidents? And do you think some of the higher severity trends within both commercial and personal auto are perhaps here to stay even after we fully come out of the pandemic?\nTricia Griffith: That's a great question. On the commercial side, we're seeing both congestion and speeding up, on the personal line side, we still haven't seen commuting congestion back to pre-pandemic. I think we're just going to have to watch that. I think we thought we were sort of coming out of the pandemic and now of course, with some of the new local ordinances, will that change, will people stay home and work from home longer? We imagine that might happen. So that could continue to have speeding at a higher rate. I think miles traveled as well. When you think about, we opened up, people were excited to get on the road, go on vacations with their family, go see grandma and grandpa, but you're right on the severity of accidents. And we're just going to have to watch that trend and see what happens when we get to some normalcy post-pandemic on commuting and congestion as well as speeding.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one last one, in terms of like you mentioned, you haven't seen, drive to work miles fully go back. If you were going to look at your book between the non-standard and the standard on the personal auto side. Have you seen on the drive to work miles perhaps pick up more of the non-standard side with maybe there's less work from home flexibility?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. When we look at our UBI miles, we sort of compare it to some occupations that would be more available to work from home. And that wouldn't and so we do see differences in those as well as even age groups in terms of, if I'm retired and I'm able to stay home. So we watch those closely as well. But remember, we price all of our customers to a lifetime 96 and that's what we work towards.\nOperator: And our second question coming from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Follow up question to the first question that you just answered. Tricia, you said that you respond with data, higher level question that. I guess the regulatory question is, what's the question is, is it tougher to push for rates today than a normal environment? And what I mean by that is, I think there's a pretty clear contrast today, unlike in other periods where the experience period you use to do your rate filings is pretty profitable, unlike the projection period where there's clearly some deterioration and not only deterioration, but questions on how long that deterioration might last is the severity, short lived, is frequency short lived as well. So some questions around that against the backdrop of a pretty profitable experience period that you're using for your rate. So does that backdrop make it harder to push for rate volumes than normally would?\nTricia Griffith: I think it is more of a challenge, but remember, we aren't looking in the rearview mirror, we're looking ahead and looking at the severity of trends, because we price for those, in the future. So while it's been a challenge, in some venues, we continue to work towards that, and again, we'll watch it closely. And just like we did during the pandemic, after we gave the over billion dollars back on the private passenger auto side, for the credits, we looked across, because we knew that, consumers were struggling, there was layoffs et cetera. We looked across states and channels and products and took rates down a little bit. And so that's really the conversation we're having with regulators. We're going to always try to do the right thing to grow as fast as we can but we have to make our target profit margins. And what we're seeing now is some pretty steep severity trends. And again, we'll watch for that we'll watch for any macroeconomic inflationary trends and the like to understand what our future rate should be.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you. Second question kind of goes towards whether the personal auto margin deterioration is -- are there certain pockets where it's worse than others. And what I mean, there is you mentioned in the Q a couple things that might make one think so, reduce marketing spend in certain areas. Number one, number two, tightening the underwriting criteria for certain consumer segments, those two things combined, make you think that maybe there's certain pockets that it's worse. And I guess, is that true? Or is it more just certainly across the board because of what's happening with driving levels going back to normal levels?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. It's really the margin erosion is really across the board in terms of frequency trends, getting closer to pre-pandemic, severity trends up whether it's injury or used parts. And then, of course, our average written premium was down. When we look at media, when we talk about that we look at our less efficient media. So it's not necessarily based on a certain customer, we look across the board and say, okay, this is our, our cost per sale, et cetera. And here's, what we believe we can get for that. On the other side, we really tried to avoid what we believe could be under priced risks. And so we developed an underwriting program many, many years ago, just to ask a few more questions to understand how to appropriately rate each of our customers to the appropriate risks. So a little bit different viewpoint from when we look at media and we look at bringing on risks that we believe are underpriced.\nDoug Constantine: I just tag on that to say, in markets where we're struggling to get right back to the previous question, we're more likely to push harder on the underwriting levers. So in markets where profitability has struggled recently, and we've yet to be able to raise price, you'll see the underwriting levers tighter than in a market where we're more confident about profitability.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: Just another question just on the rate filings and just wondering if you could share, what you're contemplating for future frequency and severity from second quarter levels? You assume that those continue to get much worse or at the same levels? Or, is it going to take some time before you get more actual experience and more results that you can include in the filings before you get data to justify the rate changes?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I mean, I think the fact that we're going to continue to take rates up means that we expect some future positive trend. It will be tough to say so we'll watch it and our belief is that long-term trends from a frequency perspective, we believe that there's a chance that could go up to pre-pandemic levels, but if you look at over the last 50 or 60 years, frequency trends have gone down based on safer cars and more strict laws, et cetera. Severity has more than offset that, whether it's injury, attorney reps or components of vehicles and we believe that can continue. We hope that it abates a little bit. But, if you look forward a couple of years, we would hope that they would have be more normalized, so we could have that sense of normalcy. Now, it's been -- there's the comparisons are often also difficult but we watch those closely. And we believe that, as of now, obviously, we talked about the rate filings that we have done in quarter two that will continue to be fairly aggressive with rates.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And just thinking about, I think you said you were looking at 5% rate increases location specific in the second quarter. Is that of the amount you think you need to take across the entire book. If I look at it, I think last costs versus '19, were up a couple percent in the second quarter, versus 2Q '19. And it looks like you took maybe three or four points of rate. So is the intention to get back to sort of the '19 loss ratio level with the 5% rate increase.\nTricia Griffith: So the 5% is the average increase and it was an aggregate of 2%. But we do look very specifically across states, across channels, across products. So there won't be a flat rate across any one of those venues, we will look at where we needed the most to get to our target lifetime profit margin. So we'll give you the averages because we're not going to go into specifics. But I will tell you that it's very different depending on the states and what we're seeing both frequency and severity.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: I want to talk about a year ago, or 18 months ago when the pandemic came on, and you made decisions to refund money to customers to cut price to increase advertising spend, in order to getting a new pool of customers and certainly the growth was very strong during the pandemic, to what extent are those customers that you put on and brought on the book, achieving the lifetime value of 96% or better? And to what extent is this period of compressed margin following with what you expected to happen as you put these customers on your books and frequency came back to normal levels?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, I think we did the right thing during the pandemic and things have been very volatile and very fluid. And so in terms of -- our sort of Holy Grail is retention. So we're going to do what we can to keep those customers at the target profit margin -- the increases will flow into renewal business. And we expect that could cause people to shop and we get that. But what we want is, in our choice of growth is policies enforced, we want to continue that growth, we know that we need to have the right rates on the street and then we've talked about that a lot. Our objective for many, many years, many decades has been to grow as fast as we can, out to below 96. And profit comes first in that order. It's one of our core values. So we'll continue to look at that. How we treat these circumstances are things that we've done before and so, not to this extent, because we don't -- this is we've never been involved in a pandemic, but we've been in these circumstances before. In fact, if you go back in time, 2012 we had similar circumstances where we found that we needed rates at the time, actually, John Sauerland, our CFO was the Personal line President and I was the President of Claims. And we set forth to get the right rate, keep it as many customers as we could, that's really important. And that worked and we were able to grow. But probably the most important example would be in 2016, when we found ourselves over our 96 goal and we reduced expenses and a little bit of marketing and really positioned ourselves well for huge growth. And in fact, in the last five years, we have grown policies in force on the private passenger auto side, greater than 70%. So how we're looking at today is, we believe we did the right thing for customers during the pandemic, we have seen trends steepen at a pretty quick rate, we're going to get the rate we need to get back and be well positioned for that growth that we believe we will calm should we head into a hard market.\nJosh Shanker: And then, I think you said that March 17, was either the best, or the second best shopping day in the company's history. I think you've probably put on a lot of Sam's or inconsistently in the short customers, to what extent is a huge growth over the past 18 months and really, even just a few months ago by having a new customer penalty on top of your overall book.\nTricia Griffith: Well, we have had a lot of Sam's, we've had a lot of growth overall. And I talked in my most recent letter about our growth in Robinson's. And again, comparisons are tough as well, because of the large growth we've had in Robinson's and some of our preferred, but yet we've brought on a fair amount of Sam's in again. We are fine with Sam's coming on the book as long as we are priced to our target profit margin.\nJohn Sauerland: I will answer that part Josh, so we have what we call cohort targets, by segment by segment. We call them our consumer marketing tiers. But we also think by channel direct versus agency, new versus renewal and obviously, geographically. And our product managers are constantly looking at their performance relative to those cohort targets. So for example, the new Sam direct customer has a target, obviously new business, we're going to spend a lot to acquire Sam, we're going to want to recoup that quickly on renewal to make sure we were in that lifetime 96. So regardless of the climate we're in, those product managers are monitoring their performance versus those targets. And where we're not meeting them, they're going to take action to make sure they meet him. So we do manage to the calendar combined ratio as a company for sure. And that's what we say our goal is, beneath that product managers are managing to those segments to those cohort targets. Does that help a little?\nJosh Shanker: Certainly. Thank you very much for the answers.\nOperator: Now our next question coming from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: I had couple on severity and one on growth. The first one is, I mean, just thinking about this. So frequencies, almost back to pre-pandemic levels. That make sense was bound to happen originally, in any event, we're going to get back there. Severity was plus seven in 2019, plus 10 in 2020. And this quarter was plus eight. So it's not exactly clear to me why this severity numbers all that surprising. I'm just trying to square all this and understand why we only started taking rate in this past quarter.\nTricia Griffith: Well, so we've seen severity trends go up in injuries, what we probably under predicted on severity was the used car valuations and not just the magnitude, but the length of time, the duration. And we did look at that for future trends, not to the extent that of what we're seeing. And again, that's something that's been very different during the pandemic in terms of supply and demand and what is happening with new cars and the lack of available chips, et cetera. So I would say that was probably a miss on our part slightly just because we hadn't seen that we did we did see it going up but not to the extent or the duration of time. And then, the injuries we continue to look at, attorney rep rate continues to go up. And we're seeing attorneys earlier in the claim sort of across regions and across limit profiles and there could be a lot of theories on that. It could be that there's more advertising on the attorney parts, it could be that if you're working from home or that you're not working, you're seeing more advertising in order to call that attorney but we are seeing attorney reps earlier in the claims than we have in the past.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Yes, it's not like what you guys were reporting numbers last quarter, people are talking more about the property inflection but I mean, clearly we're seeing some social inflation on the BI side. Is that one that you'd say you're more concerned about, kind of a casualty type lost trend versus property lost driven auto.\nTricia Griffith: I mean for the casualty trends, obviously you want to get your arms around attorney reps because those claims are more expensive take longer, not necessarily great experience. We've seen on the private passenger auto because we've seen speeding up there's been more severe accidents. We've seen, labor hours increase and number of parts increase. So that's a little bit different.  On the property side, we had 25 points of cat exposure and so I think, we are looking at a little bit different geographic expansion to make sure that we -- in a sense, derisk a little bit of that book. And then, in addition, on the property side, we want to be able to continue to get rate as we've since last year, and have a more segmented product. So it's a little bit different way we're looking at it, ultimately to get to the same endpoint of a 96 combined ratio.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, just lastly, will you describe these trends is broad based across all states and customer segments? Or is it more localized, is it more Sam's, is more Robinson's that type of thing.\nTricia Griffith: The trends of the attorney rep have been across all regions and they've gone up in different rates upon -- with limit profiles. So that's been across the board. Property really is much more specific in states where there's more weather volatility.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: I don't mean to beat a dead horse here. But is it your impression that regulators are discounting the 2020 year as an anomaly, but relying on 2019 data for indicated rate needs, which may be problematic given their higher premiums at the time and less elevated severity? At least that's what I saw in Texas, explicitly mentioning 2019 data.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. It was hard for me to be in the seat of a regulator. I think they're trying to do the best thing they are trying to do for their constituents as we are. And so that's why we share data, we talk it through and we try to do the right thing, which again, is availability for the consumers, whether it be Texas or any other state. So it's hard for me to say what a regulator is looking at, I think they always want to make sure that there's affordability for the consumers that they represent.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Yes. I just want to know, if there's any way that you could make headway or there may just be a difference of opinion, just given you're looking at different parameters?\nTricia Griffith: Probably a little of both.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. I've been just thinking of rate increases. I mean, also you took a 6.1% rate increase in Florida. And I'm just wondering how much that has to do with PIP. Understand there's a debate going on right now, if insurance could pay 80% of the claims regardless where it lies on the fee schedule. Can you just remind us your conservatism on that spectrum?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I had a lot to do with PIP a lot to do with injury increases as well, that we've talked about in terms of severity. But, Florida has always been volatile with PIP and interpretations of PIP and plaintiff attorneys. And so we are we're pricing to that. And we've seen a lot as you -- as we've told you have -- reopens based on recent decisions.\nTracy Benguigui: So any concerns over prior period that could result in adverse reserve development?\nTricia Griffith: For Florida PIP, I think we've seen less late reports, and we've anticipated in 2020, which is on the PIP side. I don't know that there's any prior, I think it's been the last couple of years. I think prior to that, I would say '19 and 20, not as much '18.\nJohn Sauerland: That's a great characterization. And frankly, Florida PIP even going back further than that has been a challenge to price accurately because courts decide what they decide and that changes a lot of the past claims decisions that were made, and a lot of files get reopened. So as we pointed out, we have had adverse development in Florida PIP past couple few years. And if you go back a decade, we had similar. The good news is over the longer term, we've been very successful in the Florida market. We have great share there and we want to continue to grow in Florida as long as we're in that 96 right now, as you pointed out, we are taking actions to address the combined in Florida. But again, over the long-term, we're very confident and happy to grow in Florida.\nTricia Griffith: And the last thing I'll say on that is, we were very happy that the governor vetoed the latest PIP reform because we thought that would not be good for consumers of Florida. And so, we always work with regulators to make sure we have the right rates there and it is a complicated state but one with which the long-term we've done well.\nDoug Constantine: We do have a question on the web, asking about Texas and commercial and personalized loss trends and what actions we are taking to improve profitability in Texas.\nTricia Griffith: We are taking rate.\nDoug Constantine: Very good. Livia, next question.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, thank you for fitting me in to your schedule. My first question will be on your comments around the targeted 96 combined ratio. You're talking about growing into other lines of commercial and the capital requirements for some of these other lines embedded in commercial are going to be different than the capital requirements, you have with other parts of your personal auto business. And it also, frankly, is applicable to your property business as well. I'm just curious, if your 96 targeted combined ratio changes depending on the capital requirements on the type of business that you're in.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. And remember, our 96 is the aggregate. So 96 is slightly different. And it's not for public consumption, but slightly different in different areas, depending on that. What we look at, also is what we want that ROE to be in any part of the business and we work towards that. Anytime you have a new business, obviously, you have a big learning experience when we went into the direct private passenger auto, we didn't make money for many years as we learned and grew. And so we expect those, that to happen as well as we learn new businesses and have our arms around trends. And as we grow, that's one of the reasons why, except for the Protective acquisition, which is very different, because they know what they're doing on larger fleets. We sort of try to grow into that. So a great example is fleets for many, many years, we did zero to nine power units, we felt we had our arms around that we were a leader in that, and now we've gone 10 to 40. So we try to learn along the way. Same thing with small business, we're starting with micro businesses, less than 20 employees to make sure that we learn as we grow and expand that addressable market.\nGreg Peters: Just like to clarify your answer on that, on the property business, you've been running about 100 combined ratio for five years now. How much longer will it be above 100, before you get -- before it stops being a drag on your consolidated results.\nTricia Griffith: Hopefully not long, because we're not happy with that either. I talked a little bit about the geographic footprint and how we are taking actions to be not have such a high percentage in states that have much more weather volatility, because as we said, that's those 25 points on the property CR. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. And we've had just a lot of headwinds from that perspective. So I can't tell you the length of time, but we're working aggressively towards derisking geographically, even if we need to slow down on getting the right rates on the street and making sure that we continue to segment our property models as deeply as we segmented our private passenger auto and commercial auto.\nJohn Sauerland: I might elaborate briefly there. We are not intending to run property above 100. And in fact, as Tricia was noting, we look at ROE across our business lines and as you note required capital we also look at expected investment returns because the duration of claims is different across lines as well. But we target ROEs across the businesses that are equal to or better than private passenger auto and we back into target combined ratios. So for home as you would expect, given the higher capital requirements, the combined ratio target is going to be richer. We took 12 points rates in home last year. We're on track to do similarly this year. And as Tricia noted, we're taking a lot of actions to get a better geographic footprint that we think reduces the impact of storm losses going forward. If you look back at our recent history, the primary driver of being over 100 has been weather losses. And here it's been difficult to model difficult to price. We're into newer markets. We're learning and we are taking -- we think aggressive actions to get that combined ratio where we want it which is well below 100.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for clarifying that. My second question, and I know it's really small relative to your overall book, but you did spend a portion of your presentation talking about it and that's Protective. And how you plan to use that as part of your commercial lines expansion strategy. And, if I look at Protective's results, over the last three years really hasn't been able to grow at all, they saddled with one large customer and their combined ratio results have certainly been well above what Progressive likes to target. So I'm just curious, if you could just give us a sense of what you see within Protective that helps you gain confidence that it's going to fit well within your overall strategy.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think first of all, if you look at Protective and the rates they've taken, as they've seen their steep severity trend since 2019, they saw that and they've been working towards that. And we're seeing the fruits of that. But more importantly, that addressable market that we saw, so there, they put us upstream into larger fleet, workers comp, which is a really important piece for small and medium fleets. So although we didn't talk a lot about what we believe we can do together long-term and we're going to spend this next six months since we literally just closed in June. We're going to spend this next six months, understanding synergies, learning from each other and then getting a very firm game plan together on what we think we can achieve in the next five years.\nOperator: And the next question coming from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Going back to the -- I guess, capital requirement and combined ratio constraints by line of business, if we're still at 96, overall, and other lines of business probably has to come in lower, should we understand that auto on its own to go above 96 and still be within the company constraint?\nTricia Griffith: You could understand that what we look at is very different, how we expense it as well. So on the direct side is front loaded versus more variable on the agency side. It's different depending on the venue, et cetera. But again, the aggregate is 96. And now we look at each of those different areas, whether it's product or channel to get there.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. I think it's like the related question. And again, it's on Florida, with the rate filings actually requested an increase that was below the indication. And I was wondering if you could talk to the considerations of when that would come into play?\nTricia Griffith: Would you repeat the question?\nMeyer Shields: Looking at a recent Florida rate filing, there was a requested increase, that was about half of the indicated rate increase. And I was wondering if you could talk through the considerations of when you make that sort of filing?\nPat Callahan: Sure. This is Pat Callahan, I\u2019m the personalized president. So typically, in some states, there will be a templated indication, and then there's our indication. And when there's a lot of uncertainty, as we look at our future trends, we'll fill out the template as required to from a filing compliance perspective. But then we apply a lot of judgment to kind of how much we actually want to take to balance growth and profitability for the business. So we recognize that in states that are relatively open to file, and then use rates like Florida, we want to take smaller bites at the apple over time to ensure that we're not bouncing our customers or increasing rates faster than necessary. So in the Florida specific case, I expect we're in there frequently, and we will be in there at least once or twice more throughout the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Gary Ransom with Dowling & Company.\nGary Ransom: I wanted to ask about small commercial and specifically, you were talking about more activity in the direct side for the BOP product. Is there anything you can talk about on the propensity to buy online? I've thought about it is somewhat of a slower moving demographic trend, but are there customers that have been through an agent for 25 years and now suddenly that they like online and starting to buy it that way?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think what you're seeing is one of our strategic pillars in place and that's a broad coverage. We want to be where, when and how customers want to shop. And so there are customers because it's a little bit more complicated and especially if this is your dream, your first business venture, you want to make sure you're protected, you have a lot of questions. And so typically and it continue to be the majority of the business have gone through agents in that coverage. We've opened up Business Quote Explorer for those customers not unlike we did years ago on the auto side, when we opened up direct, that feel comfortable with what they need to get there. And as you see the that's gone up a couple percentages, increasing on the direct side, which we are not surprised that and I think especially with the pandemic, where there was less availability, even though a lot of people weren't necessarily opening small businesses, but there was a less availability of agents versus direct just based on shelter in place opportunities that we saw that change. I would expect that more and more customers that have not ever worked with an agent will continue to go online, and that that percentage would increase, we're going to have to continue to get savvy with our investments on the business, quote, explorer side. But that's, we believe a really great opportunity. We love the fact that we have a big agent presence, but there will be customers that want to go through direct and will be there for them as part of our strategic pillar of broad coverage.\nJohn Sauerland: Gary, I would add to that. One part of it is demand, the other part is fulfillment. And across auto overtime property and now commercial, we've gotten a lot better online, meaning a far better experience. And we're starting to roll out the ability to buy online. And we see as we continue to improve the experience, make sure customers can get smoothly through quotes and actually buy online, the fulfillment piece of that equation is improving a lot. And in a direct business, to the extent you are making that side of the funnel, if you will more efficient, it's really powerful in your ability to continue to grow that business because the more efficient you are in fulfilling, the more you can spend upfront to acquire customers.\nGary Ransom: Is there any specific item you would identify as important to that fulfillment piece? Is there your questions or things along those lines?\nJohn Sauerland: Well, the ability to buy online is very, very important. So if people go through an online quote, their expectation generally we think is and some people want to call for clarification, assurance, et cetera. But many people expect to be able to click a button and buy. And we find when we elevate that in a state and this goes back to when we were doing this long time ago and auto we're now doing a property. And now in commercial, when we elevate that ability, the conversion rate goes up.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Just one quick question here. And I think kind of a follow up to previous question. Tricia, I know the personal auto care recently did take a reserve charge and related to participating versus limited, rate scheduled in the court decision in Florida. How did you interpret that decision? And does that factor in at all how you think about your reserve position in Florida PIP?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, Brian. Thanks. So I think you're referring to the limited charge and that we have. We accrue for that, as well as a couple of other that has happened over the last couple of years. And so we you know, we look at that we work with the claims organization to understand even though we don't necessarily disagree with the decision that the DCA agreed with that and, we are still challenging that. That said we want to extinguish those exposures and move on because by the time it gets to the core system, possibly to the Supreme Court, it takes many years and so we have our reserves, and our unfavorable reserves have taken that case into account.\nDoug Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time and so that concludes our event. Livia, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Progressive Corporations [first] (sic) second quarter investment event. Information about replay of the event will be available on Investor Relations section of Progressive website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Karen Bailo",
            "content": "We'll be sharing a number of charts and graphs to highlight our business performance during this presentation. While our June results include Protective based on our closing date of June 1. For the purposes of this presentation unless otherwise stated, the numbers exclude Protective. I'd like to begin with a look at our performance relative to the industry. This is a 20-year time series of Progressive commercial auto net written premium growth rate versus the rest of the industry. During this time period, our results have really diverged from the industry. There are a couple of observations around growth that I'd like to highlight. First, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and tends to move with the larger economy. And second, when the market grows Progressive has historically grown at a faster pace. In fact, since 2016, we've doubled the business and gained almost four points of market share. And that equates to more than 20% compounded growth rate and achieving more than 12% market share. The more significant divergence from the market has been an underwriting profit. We've outperformed the industry by 8 to 10 and as much as 20 points over those 20 years. Our objective is to grow as fast as we can at target combined ratios. And we've had a track record of success and outperformed the industry on both growth and profit over those 20 years. There's a number of contributing factors. But perhaps most important has been the intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. We've shared this information in the past and wanted to provide a brief refresher on how we approach our auto business. We segment our business into what we refer to as business market targets and we introduced these business market targets for commercial auto in 2014. Since introduced by BMTs are now operationalized across virtually every aspect of our business. That's important because we see meaningful and actionable differences between these BMTs. For example, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function responds to changes in different economic conditions is different. We also see that losses present differently and how they develop, attorney representation rates and litigation outcomes differ by BMT. Certainly frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT, all of which are critical inputs to determining rate level. This granular focus allows us to develop insights faster, be more responsive with strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. I want to talk about what we're observing in shopping, loss trends and how we're positioned for continued success. We have the benefit of over 10 billion miles of driving data with our telematics data. This chart shows patterns in driving miles highway congestion and highway speeding pre- and post-pandemic. You can see that as stay at home orders were issued, there was a significant decrease in miles driven and congestion on the highway. At the same time, there was an increase in highway speeding. Now while the impact from COVID on small businesses was severe, when we look at our business class level data, it's also clear that different businesses were affected differently. For example, in the truck space, fully a third of our smart haul customers saw their mileage increase, while about 8% were shut down completely. Landscapers and most construction trades were still working and other service businesses were not. Looking at more recent trends, while we see mileage and congestion back to pre-COVID levels, speeding events haven't dropped back to where they were. This raises the question around whether COVID brought a permanent change to truckers driving habits and it's something we'll keep a close eye on in the months to come. In addition to our own data, we look to other macro economic trends to develop a deeper understanding of shopping and small business trends, especially during challenging economic conditions. This chart shows our insurance shopping trends in this case, agency quote growth, for businesses that tie to goods and services sectors index to 2019. Progressive quote data is in the solid line and consumer spend data is in the dotted line. Our experience tracks closely to the rate of consumer spending on goods and services. So this is data we have and we'll continue to monitor. The macroeconomic data shows spending on goods recovered more quickly, while the services sector has lagged and has been more depressed relative to good sectors. Some of that is because services sectors were more affected by stay at home orders and good spending has been supported by federal government stimulus. That intuitively makes sense and we see that in our underlying data. Businesses that were considered more essential, plumbing or sanitation services are those that tied to the transportation of goods, like agriculture, hauling or livestock hauling responded differently versus those that are tied to services industries, like airport shuttles, food trucks and entertainers. The positive news is that as the service businesses reopen, we're seeing a recovery in spending toward 2019 levels. This increase in spending on services should drive a rebound in insurance shopping for businesses related to that sector. Again, food trucks, restaurant delivery airport shuttles just to name a few. In summary, different businesses have been affected differently. And this is important in terms of how we think about trends, the implications for frequency and severity and ultimately rate level going forward. In our last update in 2019, we shared a historical perspective that provides a good illustration of how we will approach today's environment. Back in 2016, we saw a marked increase in frequency between May and November, at the same time, some prior year reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We responded quickly to address those trends raising rates by more than 10% and made a series of underwriting changes in about three months. And we've continued with a series of changes and adjustments since. Fast forward to recent trends, you can clearly see the impact of COVID on frequency. We saw a sharp decline in frequency as stay at home orders went into effect. And as I shared earlier, driving miles from our usage-based insurance data shows driving miles and congestion levels are back to pre-pandemic levels. And the services sectors are also rebounding. Given all of those conditions, we're seeing loss frequency rising relative to COVID lows when frequency fell dramatically. And at the same time, we continue to see a steady increase in severity trends that we've been accounting for in our rate level indications. Given the variation and how businesses were affected by the pandemic, some slowing down and other seeing an increase in business. We have been and plan to continue to be cautious in our actions. We haven't lowered rates and we've been conservative in our pricing and underwriting decisions. The trends we're observing now are lining up with what's forecasted in our rate level indications. We've planned for frequency recovery and a continued steep severity trend and have kept pace with net trends with a combined rate increase of 29% from the beginning of 2016 through the first half of this year. The additional segmentation we've built into the product over the last five years has proven effective and driven better than industry underwriting results and growth. And I would suggest having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see while much of the market is slower to react has been an important part of maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business over the years. So we continue to advance our product segmentation and underwriting capabilities and we plan to continue to respond appropriately to loss trends going forward. I'd like to shift to a discussion on expenses and efficiency. Now we know from experience that companies that can achieve a lower cost structure gained share at a greater rate than the overall industry. We've seen that in the personal lines market and believe it matters in the commercial lines market as well. The correlation of efficiency aiding and growth isn't lost on us and we're well positioned on this chart. Now 2020 results show that we're nearly 11 points lower than the industry average in LAE and expense ratio. In a very price sensitive industry that 11 point advantage is significant. But there's a balance. We don't necessarily want to be the lowest because we believe in also investing in what matters, quality outcomes for customers that earn loyalty and investments that foster great work environments for our employees. To that end, I'd like to highlight where we're making investments to improve on both those fronts. This is a view of our expense ratio track record over a 10-year time period. And over that time period, we've seen a 7 to 8-point expense advantage compared to the industry. That advantage was 6 points in 2020 due in part because COVID credits flowed through expenses rather than premium, resulting in a slight elevated expense ratio. While we've had an expense advantage over this time period, we're prioritizing initiatives to extend our leadership position. There are a number of levers that drive expense ratio advantages and while we don't have enough time for a comprehensive review of all the efforts underway, I wanted to share with you two examples that demonstrate active cost management efforts to drive expense reductions and improve experiences at the same time. These both highlight our focus in managing expenses related to our growth and improving our operational efficiency. We maintain a disciplined focus on managing overhead and growth in headcount as we grow the business. This chart is designed to represent a few things. The solid blue line represents overall net earned premium growth. The solid orange line represents employee costs and real estate costs are represented in the solid black line. You can see that while employee costs and real estate costs have gone up, they've grown at a lower rate relative to net earned premium. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One is being disciplined and judicious in decisions to increase staff. We've added the dotted lines here to represent volume driven and non-volume driven employee growth. And while we've grown, our volume driven counts in line with our net earned premium pace, we've been very targeted in adding non-volume driven resources and our non-volume driven employee count has grown at a much lower rate. This discipline has resulted in growing our total employee costs, the orange line less than net earned premium growth. The second is related to real estate, like personal lines prior to the pandemic, our customer and agent services organization enabled real estate expense savings by implementing a home-based consultant model. This model has a number of benefits. It provides broader access to talent and improved our ability to increase staff to support our growing business, especially last year and it's also provided flexibility that employees value. In addition, this model allows us to grow our business without a commensurate growth in space. In 2019, almost 40% of our commercial lines agents and customer services consultants were working from home. Now we're still working through our plans as we transition back to the office post-pandemic. We expect the portion of our customer and agent services consultants that work from home to grow materially as people make the decision to remain working from home going forward. This will support our ability to grow without significantly growing our real estate footprint. The second example of our cost management efforts highlights investments in systems and technology to deliver the products and services our agents and customers value, while focusing on increasing operational efficiency. We've been investing significantly in systems to support our core auto business and in expanding our business with our BOP product and direct small business capabilities. Despite significant investments in technology and systems, we've been able to maintain our expense advantage. Now we acknowledge and expected this relatively short-term increase in technology costs to lower our costs in the long run with gains and efficiency and new lines of business. Now improving efficiency to push our expense advantage is a key objective. Two examples of progress are shown here. We've shared in previous annual report commentary that we're transitioning to a new policy administration system. And this new system is a significant driver of our technology expenses and rolling out the new system is a big part of our ability to drive more efficiency. The new system introduces more modern functionality that enables faster delivery of our products and enhancements and the ability to improve customer experiences and self-service capabilities. The initial launch of this new system in a state brings consumer online buy capabilities. The chart on the left shows the total lift in direct online sales yield with our new system. Now completely isolating the effects of the online buy capabilities is difficult but we're seeing an 80% improvement in online sales yield after introducing this new system. And that would translate to more than a 20% increase in direct auto sales. Now, while direct is still a relatively small portion of our business, we expect this added functionality to bring long-term economic benefit to us in terms of improved sales yield and lower acquisition costs for that part of our business and that's very important as this business grows. A second way we're gaining efficiency is via process automations. On the right is a representation of improvements that we've already made reducing the manual work associated with millions of documents we receive every year via fax, email or paper mail. Until recently, each document had to be manually reviewed and categorized for action either to be attached to a policy and sent directly to storage or put in queue for additional processing. Over half of these documents are in that first group. They don't require any action beyond archival. We have a project underway to automate that workflow by the end of the year using optical character recognition technology to review those documents automatically and attach them to a policy and send them to storage without human intervention and this reset resources to focus on other more value-added work. These are just two examples to illustrate how we will focus future investments. Now while we're pleased with our early progress, we're just getting started. And we have a robust roadmap ahead of us that will target more efficiency improvements and self-service capabilities designed to meet customer and agents expectations. Investments in product, experiences and more efficient workflows combined should enable us to reduce the drivers of costs to service our customers. We anticipate that by lowering our costs, we will be able to further extend our expense advantage and position as well for any market conditions. Now moving on to the other part of our expense advantage. We believe our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto vis-a\u0300-vis our competition. We've doubled the core auto business while maintaining very competitive loss adjustment expense ratios and good quality. Our claims advantage comes from a surgical focus on claims accuracy and efficiency. And back in 2019, we shared how our claims organization leverages the scale of our broader personal lines claims organization with a focus on specialization for high impact and complex claims. We continue to push commercialized specialization as we grow our business. And we also see significant potential in leveraging technology and analytics to increase productivity and claims handling segmentation along with improving accuracy. I wanted to share a brief example to illustrate how we're leveraging data, data science and advanced analytics to monitor and react to claims activity and exposure changes. The image on this slide represents a homegrown tool developed to inform leaders of claims that need review. The tool is powered by a file intervention program that uses analysis and data science to populate the tool and is designed to improve leaders focus on at risk files. This helps improve claims accuracy through better coaching and supports timely claim handling efforts. We know handling delays can result in unfavorable outcomes and the alerts are prioritized and trigger on the best date for the leader to intervene for the most favorable results. In this example, you see a code FS13 with a description potential for delayed total loss resolution. In this example, an alert triggered on March 19, with a message indicating a potential delay in resolving a total loss settlement. The leader intervenes by providing guidance to the claim rep on the open activity on the file. And since the leader intervened, the trigger is programmed to return two days later to make sure the claim rep is following up on the guidance provided. The next alert triggers on March 21. The leader reviews the file and sees that the claim rep followed up on the direction provided so no additional intervention is needed at this point in time. The leader indicates no to the intervention question in the lower left and once no intervention is selected and alert is programmed to return eight days later if the total loss is still not resolved. In this case, the total loss resolved on March 25. And so the alert didn't return for the third time. This is a powerful tool that helps our claims teams efficiently run the business of claims and contributes to more timely and accurate claims handling. A final point on our performance relative to the industry is related to reserving where our philosophy is to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation. This chart shows our commercial auto reserved development versus the industry. We have a much tighter variance and we see two primary reasons for this. One contributing factor is the claims organization we just talked about. Leveraging technology and advanced analytics to increase productivity and get the right claims to the right resource more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better outcomes. The other contributing factor is the highly segmented approach we take to loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. We've operationalized that BMT structure, in addition to the usual loss cost cuts and it allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. Having more consistent and predictable loss cost estimates through accurate reserving, lets us understand our true ultimate cost faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. So that's a little background on what we've been seeing in our commercial auto results recently and why we've been able to produce some different outcomes relative to the industry. I'd now like to turn it over to Jochen Schunter who will share a little about our plans for extending our leadership in commercial auto, including how and where protective insurance fits into those plans. Efforts to meet the broader needs of small business owners are focused on building products and capabilities to support our agency business and to meet the growing demand in the direct channel. We believe customer choice is important and our goal is to continue to work toward customers having options for how they shop for insurance with us. Our plans include both adding products we develop ourselves, as well as offering other carrier products in our in-house agency. In our experience, developing products ourselves works best in our agency business and we will continue to focus on investments that enable us to continue to grow and succeed with our agents. We're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. In addition to developing our own products, we're offering other carrier products through our in-house agency. That approach is working well for us and it will remain a part of our strategy for that part of our business. In the end, expanding our product offering is all about having a broad enough product portfolio that agents and customers never have to look elsewhere for their insurance needs. In 2019, we expanded our product offering with our own business owners policy and general liability product. This line of business opens up our addressable market with a product that fits with our customer set and creates an opportunity to extend relationships with our customers. Similar to commercial auto, our goal is to have a streamlined intuitive quote flow and competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. We initially limited our appetite to the first five categories in this table, they are big enough to matter, allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills and allow for a straightforward streamlined quoting and binding process. We've since added a sixth BMT lessors risk. We've limited our appetite in this category to those commercial rental properties that meet our underwriting criteria in the other five. The six categories depicted on this screen account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the U.S. with fewer than 20 employees. As we did last year with lessors risk, we will continue to expand the categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Today, this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to add real value in small business insurance. We chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and have designed the products systems and experience to succeed with agents. At the same time, we kept an eye on requirements for the digital channel. And last year introduced our product in our in-house agency and our online quoting platform for small business owners. We officially launched our product in May of 2019 and finished the year with four states. Last year, all things considered, we finished strong launching 13 new states and introduced an updated product model. And building on the momentum from 2020, we launched four additional states through the end of the second quarter and four more in July. So we're now in states representing just over 50% of the commercial multi-peril market. And we expect to roll out another nine to 10 states this year and that would result in a state footprint that represents about 67% of the commercial multi-peril market. Feedback we've received from our agents supports our assessment that we have an easy to use quoting and underwriting experience and competitive products. We're happy with our momentum and we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our progress where we can continue to grow profitably. I mentioned earlier that we're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier products and we're having terrific success and growing our direct to small commercial business. In September of 2018, we introduced Business Quote Explorer, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. With that edition, consumers have a full range of options for how to shop for their small business insurance with us. Going forward we will work to optimize the experience in both of these paths. There will be times when the self-directed online path is the best option for a customer and others when calling in for phone support will be the best option. We're happy with this approach as a strategy to meet the demand from consumers who are coming to us directly for their small business insurance needs. Our small business direct efforts are going well. We've been selling direct to commercial insurance for more than a decade and have made investments in assets and capabilities to meet the growing demand from commercial prospects as well as our own customers. Now pandemic-related shopping patterns do appear to be accelerating the move to online shopping in commercial insurance and we're well positioned for that move. Our marketing efforts are maturing and generating demand and we have a good stable of carriers including our own manufactured BOP and GL product and we've got an easy-to-use quoting platform. As a result of our investments and an increase in online shopping growth has accelerated considerably. And with the investments we're making to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate growth within the small business direct channel. Now the ultimate goal is to extend relationships with our customers and provide more reasons to stay. We know customers who have more products with us retain longer. When looking at our business auto and contractor commercial auto customers with multiple products, we see that those with another personal lines product stay with us 5% to 7% longer and those with a BOP product stay about 11% longer. Now we expect policy life expectancy to further extend with more targeted efforts to grow our multi-product customers. Beyond launching new products like our BOP and GL product, we're also working to make it easier to bundle more with us. Our aspirations include making it easier to purchase multiple products across commercial lines and personal lines that new business and to add products as insurance needs grow. You've heard us describe our aspirations of relationships with our customers lasting for decades or longer. We're making significant progress and expect over time our commercial relationships will contribute to increasing the number of customers that have chosen to stay with Progressive for a decade or longer. This is all part of our broader vision to become consumers and agents, number one choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we're excited to have considerable under penetrated addressable market in front of us, where we have the people, skills and assets to succeed. Thanks for your time today. And now we'll move on to the Q&A portion of our session."

            "name": "Jochen Schunter",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen. I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our commercial auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make. Let me start by talking a little bit about our two telematics programs that we have in market today. Smart Haul and Snapshot ProView. We're proud to say that we have recently surpassed $500 million of commercial auto premium in force from these telematics based programs and that we've analyzed over 10 billion miles of data. Smart Haul is our truck focused telematics program that leverages the data from federally mandated electronic logging devices or ELD for short, through the federal mandate most over the road truckers need an ELD to managed hours of service. Smart Haul uses driving data from a trucker's existing ELD in exchange for a discount on the insurance of up to 18%. And while conversion is nearly double our normal truck conversion, we continue to see a sizable loss ratio advantage for this book even after applying those steep discounts, which average about $1500 per policy. It's clear this is good business and it's all incremental and verifiable segmentation that we're able to apply at point-of-sale. To demonstrate how powerful the segmentation has proven to be, I'd like to draw your attention to the chart on the left. Telematics is the most predictive variable in our for-hire transportation segment. The depicted bar includes the power of new variables enabled by telematics in addition to variables that can be derived from telematics, such as territory ozone. As you can see, telematics is by far our most predictive rating variable, and we have plans to further evolve the model by adding even more predictiveness to it. Our continued research of driving data is allowing us to constantly evolve and improve the model. Switching over to our other telematics program, Snapshot ProView. We have a program that provides discounts and complimentary fleet management features to our non ELD customers. While this program is much younger, we already see the segmentation power of telematics, especially in segments where driving patterns vary significantly from risk-to-risk. The chart on the slide shows an average drive time for select business classes and a variance around that average. Let's pick the restaurant business class as an example, we have insureds that used a vehicle close to five hours a day, likely to deliver food. At the same time, we have restaurants that used our vehicle less than one hour a day, you can imagine lost cost may look very different for those two used cases. That's just one example how telematics data can help us create new segmentation as we create new insights from the 10 billion miles of collected data. Next, I'd like to highlight some of the most significant milestones we've been able to achieve in commercial auto over the years that we're especially proud of. First, in 2008, we became the largest writer of truck insurance in the United States. In 2015, we became the number one writer of commercial auto overall. In 2019, we became the number one writer of preferred truck in the non-fleet space, I'll talk more about that in a minute. And lastly, this year we passed $6 billion in net written premium making us more than two times the size of our next closest competitor based on trailing 12-month statutory data. As mentioned on the prior slide, we've made big strides in growing our preferred truck book enabling us to become the number one writer of non-fleet preferred truck in 2019. We define preferred truck as motor carriers that have a track record of being financially responsible with three or more years in business and a strong safety record. Based on our analysis, we grew our estimated share of non-fleet preferred truck from 5.9% in January of 2016 to 15.4% in May of 2021. On a direct written premium basis that reflects an annual growth rate of 29.5% over that same five-year time period. We did so by launching product enhancements that improved our competitiveness, while hitting our annual calendar year profit targets each of those yields. Those investments have helped us improve consideration amongst the most preferred trackers shopping for insurance. In fact, of all the non-fleet preferred motor carriers that require our federal filing that switched insurance carriers in 2021 without a lapse in coverage, we got quoted on 48.2% of them. That number is up from 35.3% in Q1 of 2016. With this success, we continue to pursue a robust roadmap to enhance our product and coverage offerings, along with improved segmentation, allowing us to offer even lower rates for the best service. Another exciting opportunity to grow our business across all BMTs is targeted at businesses with 10 to 40 vehicles. The small fleet market is about a $7 billion market, where we have low penetration and only began increasing our focus on and investing in over the last couple of years. As we increased our focus, we saw opportunities to improve our pricing and add fleet specific segmentation to provide more competitive rates to the best fleet risks. In addition, we expanded our underwriting team to support new underwriting capabilities, ensure appropriate pricing and accelerate the underwriting process. Today, we have the segmentation, assets and capabilities to compete effectively in this attractive market. As you can see, on the left chart, we've been able to more than triple our fleet book over the last five years with a meaningful acceleration in the last year. The right funnel chart shows the impact of improvements we've been able to elevate just in the last year driving that growth. While we've been able to increase quotes by 19% in the trailing 12 months, we've been able to increase find the book quotes by 85% and ultimately sales by 92%. Let me cover some of the specific improvements that have allowed us to achieve those results. First, we brought and continued to bring automation and technology to the quoting process helping us to increase efficiency. Specifically, we've automated the review of the supplemental application intake of this data into our database, underwriting review processes and related agent follow-up. We've also been able to improve the quote turnaround time by simplifying the quote process and leveraging our distribution organization to educate agents which in turn is driving agent engagement, more completed quotes and increased conversion. With our continued investments, we believe we're well positioned to continue our growth into small fleet space. Talking about investments in small fleet that's a great transition to highlight our plans to move even further upstream in the fleet markets. That's where our recent acquisition of Protective insurance fits in. Before we get to talking about how Protective will help us grow fleets, let's spend a few minutes and talk about Protective, the products Protective offers and customers they serve. Let's start with some background, Protective insurance is located in Carmel, Indiana, employing about 500 people. The company has nearly 100 years of experience of providing innovative insurance solutions primarily for the fleet trucking operations. Protective operates several statutory insurance companies which are collectively licensed in all 50 states. While Protective will benefit from Progressive strong balance sheet and financial strength. Progressive will benefit from many of Protective's unique capabilities, allowing it to successfully serve the fleet market. Let's talk about some of those capabilities and the Protective product suite. Protective sales many of the lines we're very familiar with, including commercial auto physical damage, commercial auto liability, non-trucking liability, cargo and general liability. In addition and very critical to fleets coverage needs, Protective office workers comp and occupational accident to coverages that are very additive to Progressive suffering. In fact, workers comp reflects the largest statutory commercial coverage in terms of premium, even bigger than commercial auto. As mentioned on the prior slide, this is done through a variety of statutory entities and distribution channels. Next, let's cover what customers protect themselves. While we just talked about Progressive's number one position in truck overhaul, it's important to note that we've achieved that position primarily by dominating the less than 10 vehicle space. Only recently have we begun investing into our fleet product, becoming competitive for fleets of up to 40 total vehicles inclusive of trails. We're early in that journey and while we've hit some major milestones and seen some encouraging growth, we realize that they are needed capabilities we would have to build to effectively compete for medium and large fleets. Protective delivers those capabilities allowing us to move upstream. Those include sophisticated risk retention mechanisms, allowing fleets to participate in the risk and indemnity, safety and loss control programs along with underwriting expertise, and lastly rating by mileage and revenue. Independent contractors in the FedEx affinity program are amongst many of Protective's other customers engaged in the rapidly growing last mile delivery space, a sector we expect to continue to expand over the coming years. Switching to profitability, Protective has had a long track record of generating excellent results meeting their respective profit targets over decades. Similarly to Progressive in doing so they were able to outperform the commercial auto industry consistently. While the last few years have been challenged from a profitability perspective, we strongly believe that the right actions have been taken to return to those industry leading combined ratios. Specifically Protective has refocused on its core business which is transportation insurance. In addition, significant rate was taken to account for the industry steep severity trends. We believe this focus on core products and retake already proving to be successful with the last few quarters showing constant improvement of underwriting results. In addition, Protective has reinsurance in place to protect from significant adverse development from prior accident years. Those reinsurance treaties ensure that retains severities and tails are consistent with Progressive's established risk appetite. Finally, I'd like to talk about how Protective is additive to Progressive's product offering and allows us to expand our addressable market. Clearly, while we're both heavily focused on the commercial auto line, we do so with minimal overlap. Progressive is the market leader in the small transportation space. While Protective is a leader in the medium and large transportation fleet space. Together, we're able to serve that market in its entirety and with Protective's workers comp capabilities, we're able to establish a foothold into that critical coverage. The coverage that is considered an anchor product in the small, medium and large fleet space. We look forward to further complementing each other's product offering enabling both entities to grow market share collectively. Lastly, while we're still early in this acquisition, we look forward to what we call preserve and learn for the remainder of the year. Before focusing on further integrating all commercial offerings under the Progressive commercial lines umbrella. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that we intend to maintain the Carmel, Indiana operation. This acquisition has always been about growing addressable markets, and therefore revenue collectively beyond what each of us would be able to achieve individually. With that, I'd like to go back to a slide Tricia shared earlier. This slide shows our addressable market, which has grown to $78 billion with this acquisition, which reflects an increase of more than 25%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Karen who will cover our investments in the Small Business Insurance space."

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Let me set the stage for this session. As a reminder, these are construct we call the four cornerstones. This construct allows us to focus and make investments that drive value to the organization and all of our constituents; who we are, which are our five core values. Peter Lewis wrote these back in 1987 and they have served us well over the decades. Specifically during this past year and a half as we've navigated completely foreign waters and have made decisions on behalf of all of our constituents, we have used our core values as a guide. I won't go into all that we did because I've publicly written about much of it but suffice it to say we believe all along the way, we did the right thing. Why we're here? Our purpose statement, which is true to our name, Progressive. We believe this statement is about forward progress, innovation and never resting on our past performance, where we're headed, our vision, which is to become consumers and agents number one choice and [Technical Difficulty] assurance needs with us now and as those needs evolve. We know that we must earn their trust every day in order to achieve this vision. How we'll get there? Our strategy, and more specifically our four strategic pillars, which is how we think explicitly about investing to ultimately achieve our vision. I'll briefly give you a high-level overview of how we think about each pillar. People and culture, our goal is to ensure our people and culture collectively remain our most powerful source of competitive advantage, including attracting and hiring new talent, retain the people we have and developing everyone. So that we can all have long and prosperous careers. We will support our people and culture by ensuring our people can bring their whole selves to work through our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Broad needs, we will meet the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetimes by being available where, when and how our customers want to interact with us, helping our customers select the best insurance for their current needs, as well as their evolving insurable needs throughout their lifetime. Leading brand, we will maintain the leading brand recognized for innovative offerings and supported by experiences that instill confidence with messages that resonate. Competitive pricing, we will offer competitive prices by pricing rate to risk through our industry leading segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy and claims and finding ways to continually drive costs down through process changes in technology advances. Our agenda will be in three sections and we'll cover the commercial auto market and trends in the industry, including our performance relative to the market. We'll do a market overview that will outline our long-term growth plans, and finally an update on market capabilities and expanding our product offering. Before we begin our deep dive commercialize agenda, I do want to acknowledge that we're highly cognizant of the fact that we reported a 100.5 combined ratio for June and are and have been taking steps to ensure profitability as we come out of the pandemic. Commercial lines is a huge opportunity for Progressive. So I don't want to draw attention away from the very important agenda Karen and Jochen Schunter have for you upcoming by offering prepared comments on results. I expect we'll have the opportunity in Q&A to share steps we've taken and are in the process of undertaking to ensure we achieve our calendar year 96 or better underwriting margin objective. Let's kick off the first section by talking about the addressable market. When we began these webcasts many years back, we started with showing the property and casualty addressable market and we discussed our plans for both personal lines and commercial lines. Our commercial lines offerings have evolved over time and of course, we recently acquired Protective Insurance. So we thought this was a good time to give you a more detailed update. To summarize the entire market, you'll see in the center of the slide that the total property and casualty market is 730 billion. The Progressive share 5.7% is reflected in both the blue section of the doughnut and the blue percentages. The gray reflects the industry. On the personal line side, we have a 9.6% of the 366 billion market split between personal auto at 12.9% share and homeowners at 1.7% share. We've had massive growth here but still plenty of room to grow. The commercial lines addressable market is 364 billion and includes a wide array of opportunities. The commercial auto opportunity alone is a $46 billion market, where we hold the number one position with plenty of room to grow at 12.1% share with a large other commercial addressable market of 318 billion. At this point in time, the market that we believe we can both play and win in is approximately 78 billion. If you start near the top of the circle and go clockwise, that entails monoline commercial auto, small fleet, transportation network companies, commercial auto bundled with GL and BOP, small business with GL and BOP, medium and large fleet with Protective and workers comp with Protective. The addressable markets that we aren't currently in include public transportation, larger commercial multi-peril businesses with over 20 employees and products like mortgage guarantee and marine just to name a few. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and that we started investing in many years ago to set us up for future growth. We've shared these two-by-two charts a few times. As a reminder, the X axis is the combined ratio on an inverted scale, so you want to be to the right of 100. The Y axis is net written premium growth, so you want to be above the black line showing positive growth. Together, you want to be in the top right hand shaded area where we're growing market share at or below a 96 combined ratio. The blue dot is Progressive, the black dot is the industry and the gray dots are the others in the top 10 each year since 2015 through 2020. As we reflect in the past six years, we've consistently been in that area, growing market share and achieving at least a 96 combined ratio. In fact, on both profitability and growth, we frequently beat the industry in any individual competitor by wide margins. I'd like to get into the meat of their program. But before I do that, I'll give some background on our speakers. I think many of you have met Karen before. Karen Bailo is our Commercial Lines President. She's been with Progressive for over 30 years with her most recent role as General Manager of Acquisition and Small Business Insurance. Karen has held several other significant leadership positions including personal lines GM, commercial lines controller, and most notably, she spent nine years building our agency distribution, organization, and positioned Progressive as a preferred supplier in that channel. Karen started her career in customer service as a management trainee and like others on our executive team, she was a claims rep early in her Progressive career. A graduate of the University of South Carolina, Karen earned a bachelor's degree in psychology with a minor in Statistics, and she went on to earn an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. Jochen Schunter began his career in Progressive in 2006, after moving to Cleveland, Ohio from Southern Germany. He's an alumnus of both the University of Dayton where he earned an MBA and of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universita\u0308t Erlangen-Nu\u0308rnberg, where he earned bachelor's and master's degree in the arts. After doing rounds in both the accounting and Alice rotational programs at Progressive, Jochen joined commercial lines in 2008. He started out in various pricing and control functions and then moved into product management. First, he managed several states including California and our market entry into Hawaii and then took on big responsibilities as the leader of our truck product. During his tenure, he significantly contributed to increasing our market share by rolling out numerous product enhancements and also improving segmentation. Now as Commercial Line Controller, Jochen leads the organization responsible for ensuring we run a profitable business. This includes strategy and performance monitoring, risk analysis, data and analytics, rate setting compliance and recovery as well as finance and accounting. I'll now hand it over to Karen to outline our commercial lines trends. Thanks, Elyse. This is Tricia. We respond with data. So we have data that is showing on steep trends and severity and our need to get rates on the street. And we provide that and try to work with our regulators to get those push through. In the long run, we want to make sure we're available for consumers. And we can only be available if we're able to reach our objective of growing as fast as we can. But more importantly, at a 96 combined ratio or less. So we continue to work with regulators, we've had some good success in Texas, as you mentioned, every state has little nuances. But we're going to continue to work side-by-side to do the right things for our collective consumers and customers. That's a great question. On the commercial side, we're seeing both congestion and speeding up, on the personal line side, we still haven't seen commuting congestion back to pre-pandemic. I think we're just going to have to watch that. I think we thought we were sort of coming out of the pandemic and now of course, with some of the new local ordinances, will that change, will people stay home and work from home longer? We imagine that might happen. So that could continue to have speeding at a higher rate. I think miles traveled as well. When you think about, we opened up, people were excited to get on the road, go on vacations with their family, go see grandma and grandpa, but you're right on the severity of accidents. And we're just going to have to watch that trend and see what happens when we get to some normalcy post-pandemic on commuting and congestion as well as speeding. Yes. When we look at our UBI miles, we sort of compare it to some occupations that would be more available to work from home. And that wouldn't and so we do see differences in those as well as even age groups in terms of, if I'm retired and I'm able to stay home. So we watch those closely as well. But remember, we price all of our customers to a lifetime 96 and that's what we work towards. I think it is more of a challenge, but remember, we aren't looking in the rearview mirror, we're looking ahead and looking at the severity of trends, because we price for those, in the future. So while it's been a challenge, in some venues, we continue to work towards that, and again, we'll watch it closely. And just like we did during the pandemic, after we gave the over billion dollars back on the private passenger auto side, for the credits, we looked across, because we knew that, consumers were struggling, there was layoffs et cetera. We looked across states and channels and products and took rates down a little bit. And so that's really the conversation we're having with regulators. We're going to always try to do the right thing to grow as fast as we can but we have to make our target profit margins. And what we're seeing now is some pretty steep severity trends. And again, we'll watch for that we'll watch for any macroeconomic inflationary trends and the like to understand what our future rate should be. Yes. It's really the margin erosion is really across the board in terms of frequency trends, getting closer to pre-pandemic, severity trends up whether it's injury or used parts. And then, of course, our average written premium was down. When we look at media, when we talk about that we look at our less efficient media. So it's not necessarily based on a certain customer, we look across the board and say, okay, this is our, our cost per sale, et cetera. And here's, what we believe we can get for that. On the other side, we really tried to avoid what we believe could be under priced risks. And so we developed an underwriting program many, many years ago, just to ask a few more questions to understand how to appropriately rate each of our customers to the appropriate risks. So a little bit different viewpoint from when we look at media and we look at bringing on risks that we believe are underpriced. Well, I mean, I think the fact that we're going to continue to take rates up means that we expect some future positive trend. It will be tough to say so we'll watch it and our belief is that long-term trends from a frequency perspective, we believe that there's a chance that could go up to pre-pandemic levels, but if you look at over the last 50 or 60 years, frequency trends have gone down based on safer cars and more strict laws, et cetera. Severity has more than offset that, whether it's injury, attorney reps or components of vehicles and we believe that can continue. We hope that it abates a little bit. But, if you look forward a couple of years, we would hope that they would have be more normalized, so we could have that sense of normalcy. Now, it's been -- there's the comparisons are often also difficult but we watch those closely. And we believe that, as of now, obviously, we talked about the rate filings that we have done in quarter two that will continue to be fairly aggressive with rates. So the 5% is the average increase and it was an aggregate of 2%. But we do look very specifically across states, across channels, across products. So there won't be a flat rate across any one of those venues, we will look at where we needed the most to get to our target lifetime profit margin. So we'll give you the averages because we're not going to go into specifics. But I will tell you that it's very different depending on the states and what we're seeing both frequency and severity. Yes. I mean, I think we did the right thing during the pandemic and things have been very volatile and very fluid. And so in terms of -- our sort of Holy Grail is retention. So we're going to do what we can to keep those customers at the target profit margin -- the increases will flow into renewal business. And we expect that could cause people to shop and we get that. But what we want is, in our choice of growth is policies enforced, we want to continue that growth, we know that we need to have the right rates on the street and then we've talked about that a lot. Our objective for many, many years, many decades has been to grow as fast as we can, out to below 96. And profit comes first in that order. It's one of our core values. So we'll continue to look at that. How we treat these circumstances are things that we've done before and so, not to this extent, because we don't -- this is we've never been involved in a pandemic, but we've been in these circumstances before. In fact, if you go back in time, 2012 we had similar circumstances where we found that we needed rates at the time, actually, John Sauerland, our CFO was the Personal line President and I was the President of Claims. And we set forth to get the right rate, keep it as many customers as we could, that's really important. And that worked and we were able to grow. But probably the most important example would be in 2016, when we found ourselves over our 96 goal and we reduced expenses and a little bit of marketing and really positioned ourselves well for huge growth. And in fact, in the last five years, we have grown policies in force on the private passenger auto side, greater than 70%. So how we're looking at today is, we believe we did the right thing for customers during the pandemic, we have seen trends steepen at a pretty quick rate, we're going to get the rate we need to get back and be well positioned for that growth that we believe we will calm should we head into a hard market. Well, we have had a lot of Sam's, we've had a lot of growth overall. And I talked in my most recent letter about our growth in Robinson's. And again, comparisons are tough as well, because of the large growth we've had in Robinson's and some of our preferred, but yet we've brought on a fair amount of Sam's in again. We are fine with Sam's coming on the book as long as we are priced to our target profit margin. Well, so we've seen severity trends go up in injuries, what we probably under predicted on severity was the used car valuations and not just the magnitude, but the length of time, the duration. And we did look at that for future trends, not to the extent that of what we're seeing. And again, that's something that's been very different during the pandemic in terms of supply and demand and what is happening with new cars and the lack of available chips, et cetera. So I would say that was probably a miss on our part slightly just because we hadn't seen that we did we did see it going up but not to the extent or the duration of time. And then, the injuries we continue to look at, attorney rep rate continues to go up. And we're seeing attorneys earlier in the claim sort of across regions and across limit profiles and there could be a lot of theories on that. It could be that there's more advertising on the attorney parts, it could be that if you're working from home or that you're not working, you're seeing more advertising in order to call that attorney but we are seeing attorney reps earlier in the claims than we have in the past. I mean for the casualty trends, obviously you want to get your arms around attorney reps because those claims are more expensive take longer, not necessarily great experience. We've seen on the private passenger auto because we've seen speeding up there's been more severe accidents. We've seen, labor hours increase and number of parts increase. So that's a little bit different.  On the property side, we had 25 points of cat exposure and so I think, we are looking at a little bit different geographic expansion to make sure that we -- in a sense, derisk a little bit of that book. And then, in addition, on the property side, we want to be able to continue to get rate as we've since last year, and have a more segmented product. So it's a little bit different way we're looking at it, ultimately to get to the same endpoint of a 96 combined ratio. The trends of the attorney rep have been across all regions and they've gone up in different rates upon -- with limit profiles. So that's been across the board. Property really is much more specific in states where there's more weather volatility. Yes. It was hard for me to be in the seat of a regulator. I think they're trying to do the best thing they are trying to do for their constituents as we are. And so that's why we share data, we talk it through and we try to do the right thing, which again, is availability for the consumers, whether it be Texas or any other state. So it's hard for me to say what a regulator is looking at, I think they always want to make sure that there's affordability for the consumers that they represent. Probably a little of both. Yes, I had a lot to do with PIP a lot to do with injury increases as well, that we've talked about in terms of severity. But, Florida has always been volatile with PIP and interpretations of PIP and plaintiff attorneys. And so we are we're pricing to that. And we've seen a lot as you -- as we've told you have -- reopens based on recent decisions. For Florida PIP, I think we've seen less late reports, and we've anticipated in 2020, which is on the PIP side. I don't know that there's any prior, I think it's been the last couple of years. I think prior to that, I would say '19 and 20, not as much '18. And the last thing I'll say on that is, we were very happy that the governor vetoed the latest PIP reform because we thought that would not be good for consumers of Florida. And so, we always work with regulators to make sure we have the right rates there and it is a complicated state but one with which the long-term we've done well. We are taking rate. Yes. And remember, our 96 is the aggregate. So 96 is slightly different. And it's not for public consumption, but slightly different in different areas, depending on that. What we look at, also is what we want that ROE to be in any part of the business and we work towards that. Anytime you have a new business, obviously, you have a big learning experience when we went into the direct private passenger auto, we didn't make money for many years as we learned and grew. And so we expect those, that to happen as well as we learn new businesses and have our arms around trends. And as we grow, that's one of the reasons why, except for the Protective acquisition, which is very different, because they know what they're doing on larger fleets. We sort of try to grow into that. So a great example is fleets for many, many years, we did zero to nine power units, we felt we had our arms around that we were a leader in that, and now we've gone 10 to 40. So we try to learn along the way. Same thing with small business, we're starting with micro businesses, less than 20 employees to make sure that we learn as we grow and expand that addressable market. Hopefully not long, because we're not happy with that either. I talked a little bit about the geographic footprint and how we are taking actions to be not have such a high percentage in states that have much more weather volatility, because as we said, that's those 25 points on the property CR. It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight. And we've had just a lot of headwinds from that perspective. So I can't tell you the length of time, but we're working aggressively towards derisking geographically, even if we need to slow down on getting the right rates on the street and making sure that we continue to segment our property models as deeply as we segmented our private passenger auto and commercial auto. Yes. I think first of all, if you look at Protective and the rates they've taken, as they've seen their steep severity trend since 2019, they saw that and they've been working towards that. And we're seeing the fruits of that. But more importantly, that addressable market that we saw, so there, they put us upstream into larger fleet, workers comp, which is a really important piece for small and medium fleets. So although we didn't talk a lot about what we believe we can do together long-term and we're going to spend this next six months since we literally just closed in June. We're going to spend this next six months, understanding synergies, learning from each other and then getting a very firm game plan together on what we think we can achieve in the next five years. You could understand that what we look at is very different, how we expense it as well. So on the direct side is front loaded versus more variable on the agency side. It's different depending on the venue, et cetera. But again, the aggregate is 96. And now we look at each of those different areas, whether it's product or channel to get there. Would you repeat the question? Yes. I think what you're seeing is one of our strategic pillars in place and that's a broad coverage. We want to be where, when and how customers want to shop. And so there are customers because it's a little bit more complicated and especially if this is your dream, your first business venture, you want to make sure you're protected, you have a lot of questions. And so typically and it continue to be the majority of the business have gone through agents in that coverage. We've opened up Business Quote Explorer for those customers not unlike we did years ago on the auto side, when we opened up direct, that feel comfortable with what they need to get there. And as you see the that's gone up a couple percentages, increasing on the direct side, which we are not surprised that and I think especially with the pandemic, where there was less availability, even though a lot of people weren't necessarily opening small businesses, but there was a less availability of agents versus direct just based on shelter in place opportunities that we saw that change. I would expect that more and more customers that have not ever worked with an agent will continue to go online, and that that percentage would increase, we're going to have to continue to get savvy with our investments on the business, quote, explorer side. But that's, we believe a really great opportunity. We love the fact that we have a big agent presence, but there will be customers that want to go through direct and will be there for them as part of our strategic pillar of broad coverage. Yes, Brian. Thanks. So I think you're referring to the limited charge and that we have. We accrue for that, as well as a couple of other that has happened over the last couple of years. And so we you know, we look at that we work with the claims organization to understand even though we don't necessarily disagree with the decision that the DCA agreed with that and, we are still challenging that. That said we want to extinguish those exposures and move on because by the time it gets to the core system, possibly to the Supreme Court, it takes many years and so we have our reserves, and our unfavorable reserves have taken that case into account."

            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "Sure. This is Pat Callahan, I'm the personalized president. So typically, in some states, there will be a templated indication, and then there's our indication. And when there's a lot of uncertainty, as we look at our future trends, we'll fill out the template as required to from a filing compliance perspective. But then we apply a lot of judgment to kind of how much we actually want to take to balance growth and profitability for the business. So we recognize that in states that are relatively open to file, and then use rates like Florida, we want to take smaller bites at the apple over time to ensure that we're not bouncing our customers or increasing rates faster than necessary. So in the Florida specific case, I expect we're in there frequently, and we will be in there at least once or twice more throughout the remainder of the year."

            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "I will answer that part Josh, so we have what we call cohort targets, by segment by segment. We call them our consumer marketing tiers. But we also think by channel direct versus agency, new versus renewal and obviously, geographically. And our product managers are constantly looking at their performance relative to those cohort targets. So for example, the new Sam direct customer has a target, obviously new business, we're going to spend a lot to acquire Sam, we're going to want to recoup that quickly on renewal to make sure we were in that lifetime 96. So regardless of the climate we're in, those product managers are monitoring their performance versus those targets. And where we're not meeting them, they're going to take action to make sure they meet him. So we do manage to the calendar combined ratio as a company for sure. And that's what we say our goal is, beneath that product managers are managing to those segments to those cohort targets. Does that help a little? That's a great characterization. And frankly, Florida PIP even going back further than that has been a challenge to price accurately because courts decide what they decide and that changes a lot of the past claims decisions that were made, and a lot of files get reopened. So as we pointed out, we have had adverse development in Florida PIP past couple few years. And if you go back a decade, we had similar. The good news is over the longer term, we've been very successful in the Florida market. We have great share there and we want to continue to grow in Florida as long as we're in that 96 right now, as you pointed out, we are taking actions to address the combined in Florida. But again, over the long-term, we're very confident and happy to grow in Florida. I might elaborate briefly there. We are not intending to run property above 100. And in fact, as Tricia was noting, we look at ROE across our business lines and as you note required capital we also look at expected investment returns because the duration of claims is different across lines as well. But we target ROEs across the businesses that are equal to or better than private passenger auto and we back into target combined ratios. So for home as you would expect, given the higher capital requirements, the combined ratio target is going to be richer. We took 12 points rates in home last year. We're on track to do similarly this year. And as Tricia noted, we're taking a lot of actions to get a better geographic footprint that we think reduces the impact of storm losses going forward. If you look back at our recent history, the primary driver of being over 100 has been weather losses. And here it's been difficult to model difficult to price. We're into newer markets. We're learning and we are taking -- we think aggressive actions to get that combined ratio where we want it which is well below 100. Gary, I would add to that. One part of it is demand, the other part is fulfillment. And across auto overtime property and now commercial, we've gotten a lot better online, meaning a far better experience. And we're starting to roll out the ability to buy online. And we see as we continue to improve the experience, make sure customers can get smoothly through quotes and actually buy online, the fulfillment piece of that equation is improving a lot. And in a direct business, to the extent you are making that side of the funnel, if you will more efficient, it's really powerful in your ability to continue to grow that business because the more efficient you are in fulfilling, the more you can spend upfront to acquire customers. Well, the ability to buy online is very, very important. So if people go through an online quote, their expectation generally we think is and some people want to call for clarification, assurance, et cetera. But many people expect to be able to click a button and buy. And we find when we elevate that in a state and this goes back to when we were doing this long time ago and auto we're now doing a property. And now in commercial, when we elevate that ability, the conversion rate goes up."

The company will now make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its annual reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which has been posted to the company's website. Although CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make a brief statement. The company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions.  Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, Tamara, and good morning. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events typically include the presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions may be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter of 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Welcome to Progressive\u2019s first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollout brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next for the positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19% and we reported a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable with the exception of Property, where catastrophic weather loss is added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continues to be strong at 12%. And I'm most excited to report that we pass the milestones of 17 million Personal Auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs, and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004, that we reported double digit growth in personal auto, special lines and commercial lines policies in force. We couldn't be proud of that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets.  I\u2019d like to take some time to address the effects that pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So, it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March, 2021 results. And to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons. This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects two items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping, virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of that pandemic growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example, why since the denominator was only nominally affected by dependent. Last year's new business metrics continued to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020. So not always negatively. In mid-April, 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks, were released which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter, 2021 year-over-year, new business growth. Also starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief Program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our personal auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our positive retention. Both, policy enforced counts and retention metrics, were affected by billing leniency. In Commercial Lines, our TNC business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles to be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines, net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. Our property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, property business suffered significant losses. Further the hail storms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll more details on the late April events and our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and it was helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was a desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic. One in which senior managers from around the organization will present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least two of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight commercial lines. Looking forward into the rest of the 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think, pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question Tamara.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the frequency disclosure in the 10-Q the frequency was down, but all coverages except collision in the first quarter. I was just interested on knowing why is it setting more color on what was going on.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, we are actually assessing that right now. When we look at the gap in PD and collision, at least one other competitor has similar results. We believe in part it is due to our CWP rates being different in PD and collision. So right now, Elyse, we're having a Gary Traicoff group and our Claims Control group dig in a little bit deeper. The reporting is similar CDP rate is different. So, we're trying to discern exactly what that is.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the raft on you saw some pretty strong new app growth on there and you also saw strong renewal growth as well. So, I guess my question is, is the new business penalty is significant. And is it being mapped by the increase that you are also seeing within on your renewals business as well?\nTricia Griffith: I think whenever we acquire new business, we're obviously going to spend more for it in terms of both advertising which you saw increase 25% in the direct sliding commission. So, I don't know that the penalty is extraordinary, John, you can weigh in little bit on that. The renewal, one, we're proud of our service and our rates. So, we know that some of the retention gains are likely due to what has happened during a pandemic in terms of non-cancellation, et cetera. But I wouldn't say that there is a big penalty.\nJohn Sauerland: I would agree. The new business growth is certainly a function of the dominator. We recognize that, but it's also a function of 25% more advertising spend. And we always like to reiterate that we are only spending when we believe it to be efficient. But in terms of a penalty, the mix in terms of policies and premium, new to renewal is fairly stable, even when you're growing your business a lot and the business are as mature as our businesses are.\nElyse Greenspan: And then just once quick follow-up on my first question. When you said CWP, I just want to make sure is that claims with payments when you were discussing on the collision question I had to start?\nTricia Griffith: I'm sorry about that Elyse we have a lot of acronyms here. It's claims without payments. So, claims that come in and then we close them because we no longer see an exposure. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. Extremely thanks.\nJohn Sauerland: I was just going to clarify this trend for close without payments for collision has been going down. It's actually predates the pandemic and for property damage has been going up. So that obviously affects the total frequency number. Tamara next question.\nOperator: Your next response is from Greg Peters with Raymond James, please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. My first question will be on commission rates. I know some of your competitors have lightened up on the commissions that pay their agents. This has happened in the auto business. But also in the property business, a lot of the regional carriers have been slammed with high combined ratios and underwriting losses, and we're also hearing them apply pressure on commission rates. Can you talk to us about your view on commission rates? Give us a synopsis of the history and then what do you think is going to happen to 2021?\nTricia Griffith: I mean the history of our commission, right, so we try to look at in aggregate right around 10, 10.5. And then it's different depending on the type of customer that comes in, if things are bundled, we obviously have several thousand Platinum agents to get a higher commission because they are bundling the auto and home those Robinson's customers. And so, if you bring in a group of customers that we believe are going to be there short term, the commission might be less. Again, the aggregate is, we try to keep around 10%, 10.5%. And we also do have some preferred programs and bonuses for agents depending on their loss performance. It's not across the Board, it's with specific agents. Do you want to add anything John?\nJohn Sauerland: The 10.5% that Tricia is siting is generally where we run in our auto business. On the property side, we have a higher commission rate. But the overarching objective here is to ensure we have competitive prices, that means we have to have competitive commissions as well as competitive other costs when we call non-acquisition expense ratio or costs. And so really, it's the combination of go-to-market in terms of having a competitive, aggregate expense ratio, both of those come into play and obviously a condition in which we think our agents will thrive. So there has been downward movement from competitors. You are right. I think we have seen some positives to that to some degree, because our commissions are more like competitors these days than perhaps, they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact of that. That's where we're going. \nGreg Peters: Thank you for that answer. My next question will focus on the property business because it does stand out for its underwriting results, which is very unprogressive like. I'm wondering if the view on the property business at this point in time is more of a loss leader to drive retention in the Robinson's. And so, you're willing to sacrifice your margins in order to drive up retention or alternatively, do you also have this overarching objective to eventually get that business down to, I think, your corporate target is 96 combined ratio maybe it's lower because it's property. but some color there would be helpful.\nTricia Griffith : Yes. No, we do not want to be a loss leader. Profit is one of our core values. We have a very specific target margin for our property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96. We have just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So, if you look at over the years, how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick rate, our segmentation, in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in homes. So, we have new product models, we have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be your roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in they hail prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that that really causes a lot. In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So, in 2020 we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1, and we have another 4.2 expected in quarter two. So, we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal. Now, what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of a bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is without having a property product, we would not have gotten, likely we would have not gotten most of those autos. So, we want those. But we want to make our target margins across the Board period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have \u2013 along with the industry, have been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have, re-insurance, heavily re-insurance on the property side to protect the downside. But we're not thrilled with those results and we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for the answer.\nTricia Griffith : Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichaelPhillips: Thanks. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question on Telematics and outside of pricing. We've seen some competitors talk about increasing Telematics and claims. And I guess, I'm curious if you could talk about \u2013 excuse me any value that you are currently getting from Snapshot and claims. And then related, is there any opportunities maybe outside of price and segmentation for Snapshot to, I guess, extend the period of time that you collect data from Snapshot to help in other areas besides, for instance, segmentation.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Michael. We've been testing and looking into claims and Snapshot, understanding the facts of loss, fraud, other things for quite some time. I think we've had 150,000 customers that we currently have access to claims information, should they have a loss. And we'll have more to come on that. We've been working on that for a while. But we think it is an important next step for the use in our Telematics. And we've talked often on too about do we have continuous monitoring? Would that help, not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also can help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows, and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work-from-home versus not work-from-home, et cetera, as well as some of the other items we've talked about the Apron Relief. So, I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they are driving less the ability to prove that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades, we'll continue to do so, we do so on both the personal auto and the commercial outside, really happy with our smart hall results very successful. And the program is very profitable on the commercial auto side because that's a big expense for truckers. I mean all of those things are on our agenda and we continued to invest a lot in this area.\nJohn Sauerland: The other thing, I don't know if we call it Telematics or not, that is evolving is dash cam video. So especially in the commercial space, those devices are frequently one in the same and the higher limits in the commercial space if you have a video, it can be extremely helpful in resolving claims because some of those vehicles are targeted because of the limits. And if you have video that clearly shows in which staged it resolves the claims very quickly. So, Telematics is certainly a benefit, obviously profitability and rating side, as Tricia mentioned, evolving for claims for personal and evolving for commercial as well, including dash cam video.\nMichaelPhillips: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Second question is you got some kudos this weekend from the friends in Omaha on your lead you have in Telematics and with those pricing. But I guess if we look at \u2013 and they said, they are going to start to do more. So, I would think that that gap could, narrow possibly if we combine that with if we look at some states where the use of credit score and use of Telematics has been limited, if not all, about bans and these aren't small states, Mass, New York as examples, they're the lead from that competitor is pretty significant over you in terms of market share gains. So, I guess if we combine those two things and credit score may start to fade away in other states and then their use of Telematics may start to pick up. How do you think about that competitive dynamic between you and them in states as market shifts away from credit, and they start to shift more towards Telematics?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, great question. I'll use the G-word. So yes, GEICO did, Berkshire talked a lot about it and they are a formidable competitor. And we liked the competition because it makes us better instead for customers. Here is how we think about segmentation. We've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now, and we're not going to stop. And we believe rate to risk has a lot to do as many different variables. Insurance, credit scores being one of them, usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So, I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many billion miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the commercial auto side. So, we like the competition we think it was great. And now ten years ago, I might not have said this. But now we have head-to-head brands. So, you may like her, or you may not, but you know who flow is, and we're very proud of flow, the network and all the different characters. So, I think going head-to-head on all those things is a good thing. I've always been a competitive, and we like that. I think it makes us better. It makes sure that you don't just rest on your laurels. So, we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables, as well as our brand, our broad coverage, and the people and culture at Progressive. And we think all those together are really winning formula.\nMichaelPhillips: Okay. Thank you, Tricia. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I had a question Tricia in your letter you spoke about Robinson PIF growth up 20% in the direct channel and up 16% in the agency channel. I guess, I'm wondering if you could just sort of level set us here and just think about what percent of the book now is bundled customers? And also, maybe just talk a bit about margin differential and policy life expectancy differential where that stands today?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, so we're very happy about the increase in Robinson. That's really what our goal has been to have those bundled customers. We've added some platinum agents on the agency side. I would say, our total book of Robinson right now is right around 10%, which is a much higher than it was many years ago. So, we continue to kind of gain that momentum in Robinson. And what was the other part of your question?\nJohn Sauerland: Profitability.\nTricia Griffith: Profitability. Yes, they are preferred customers, so we believe they are more profitable. And on the retention side the retention is dramatically different not just on the Robinson side, but as you have, more and more policies with us. So that's why it's so important for us to continue to give people a reason to stay for decades and decades, to be able to have products that can all come from the same care, whether or not we write it on our paper or not. So yes, so that's the preferred customer, and we want wider margins there and the retention is longer.\nJohn Sauerland: The target, just for clarification, across the customer segments for auto on a lifetime basis is consistent. So obviously our loss costs vary at times. And frankly, during the pandemic more preferred customers who have the ability to work-from-home have been driving less than other customers whose professions require them to drive to the office. So, while we might have different margins by segment in the near term due to extenuating circumstances, our target margin across those customer segments is consistent, it\u2019s 96.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit just over to the severity side of the equation just thinking about loss costs, it didn't look like you saw a big increase in severity this quarter. Property damage severity was flattish, collision up a little bit. But obviously hearing a lot about supply shortages, chip shortages, just wondering how you are thinking about severity as we go forward combined with the mix? Maybe claims coming back a little bit. So, the mix of claims might be somewhat of a tailwind for severity where you have a bit more fender benders and that could potentially bring it down.  But sort of just maybe at a high level, just want to get your take in terms of where you expect severity to go, just given everything that we're seeing in the macro environment right now?\nTricia Griffith: I wish I knew the answer to that question. That is such a tough one. We are seeing some losses come back, especially now, it makes sense on the special lines side, we'll watch that closely. We haven't been affected yet from the semiconductor shortage. We watched those things closely. Some of the severity, we'll look at in terms of our average premium is down a little bit, and we've had a lot of cat losses. So, all those things play into it. And then of course it really does, like you said, it plays into it in terms of what do people do as different states open. So, will there be more highway travel because you are packing up the kids to go see grandma and grandpa, that may cause less volatile accidents we've been seeing. Obviously, the congestion is less in the pandemic than it will be. So, we are watching all of those things closely. And we're going to be able to react to those. And we've never been in this situation. So, we will watch closely with not just our UBI data, but some other data that we're starting to gleam in terms of understanding when more people are starting to work from the office. And so, we have some occupations and some data that shows some people are already there, some people are there a little bit more often. We're going to continue to watch that because, we think that could creep up pretty quickly and we want to be on top of that. \nDavid Motemaden: Thank you. That makes sense. And maybe just following up on that point, was any of that just sort of, I guess, caution or uncertainty did that come through? Because it looks like you guys after decreasing rates last year, it looks like you increase rates in auto, obviously not a little bit by a little bit, hundred percent, but did that have any influence on that rate change?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we look at all the trends in terms of what we do. So, after we took to credits, then we looked across the Board and we looked state by state, product by product, channel by channel, and our goal was always to take small bites of the apple because our customers, we know they want rate stability. And so, we felt great at the end of this year and now we're doing the same thing. We're taking a look and different states have very different attributes in terms of increases in frequency and severity and driving behavior. So that less than 1% is just based on us, looking at the data and making tweaks. And we'll do that the rest of this year as we see things unfold. So, it's really using the data and then saying, okay, we need a little bit more on in this product, in this data, in this channel. And that's why, I think, the way we're set up is so good because we're a machine that can react pretty quickly to those trends as they unfold.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a clarification, please. On the March 17th Shopping Day, the biggest shopping day you've seen, when people got their stimulus checks, are these Sam with discontinuous coverage who have come back into the insured population along those lines. I mean, yes, I know you are \u2013 you go through certainly right that business, but it obviously doesn't have a lot of persistency. I'm just trying to understand the surge related to the stimulus and what that means maybe for April or May?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Josh. And actually, for years, if you go back, we presented this in IR meeting probably maybe seven or eight years ago. We saw that shopping when people get their earned income tax stimulus from the government. And it is largely Sams. It is other people that I think other constituents that have lost their insurance or couldn't afford to it. But in the large part Sams, and our theory in Sams, we grew up with them. We love them as long as it can make our target margin. So, the stimulus just exacerbated that. These are people that are trying to do the right thing and maybe lost coverage and want to get back in the game and be legal and do the right thing. So, we see this and other stimulus that started in and will continue to be something where we'll increase shopping behavior for the industry as a whole, but yes, in large part is it is predominantly Sams.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. And then just follow-up on David's severity question. We've obviously heard a lot about lumber prices going up and we've heard about rental car issues and whatnot. Those issues that seem very, very close to what might be a severity inflation related issue for Progressive. In your current pricing, are the inflation issues that are sort of kitchen table issues that everybody knows about that captured in how you're pricing right now, or is that \u2013 is that kind of contribute to future rates?\nTricia Griffith: We look at all the macroeconomics that are going on and react to that on a severity basis. I would say on the rental coverage, especially for our first party, we have contracts in place to minimize the amount that you pay per day on a rental. So, we feel good about that. We also believe on the rental side that, if you get out there and see the car, customers want their car back in their driveway. So, we really do try to compress the time with which to get the car back into at or better shape than before the accident. So, we've always pride ourselves on the actual time that takes, which of course affects rental. On lumber, we will start to see that unfold. And if we believe that it is a piece of the severity, we will price that in future rate increases.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes, Josh, as you know, our insurance is an interesting product because you truly don't know the cost of goods sold until a year from now in case of home. But the rate indications is what we call them forward looking process to say, what should I price level be over the coming 12, 18, whatever months. We are selecting trends for frequency and severity, and they are informed as Tricia said by macro and economical views, but also a little more specific views such as the cost of lumber. But obviously, that is a near term spike over the long term. We're not sure where that goes. And we would have taken a little more holistic approach to selecting in that case, the severity trend for the price level going forward.\nJosh Shanker: All right. Well, there's lots of digesting there and I appreciate the answers.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\nGary Ransom: Good morning. I wanted to ask about quoting and conversion. I think, I see your conversion is up a lot. That probably is explained by accurate matching of price and risk. But on the quote side, you're doing something powerful that gets people in the funnel in the first place. And you have a big flow of customers. So, if I'm sitting at home, whether I have a stimulus check or not, maybe I'm a Robinson. And simply I decide I'm going to go shopping. Just wondering what's some of the key ingredients of being successful at getting that customer into get a Progressive quote?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, Gary. I think a lot of it is our brand. So, we started out \u2013 I started out one of the answers with 10 years ago, 11 years ago, our brand would be different. It's about awareness and people know who Progressive is. They know our brand is a solid brand, is a reputable brand. So that's kind of awareness gets you on the short list. And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door. So, we believe that \u2013 we've obviously spent a lot more on brand and other 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we were spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So, if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad, or you want to call in, or you want to go to your agent, we try to be where, when and how you want to shop just to make it easy for our customers. And then you have competitive prices. So, I think that is really important and that goes, of course, into our segmentation and understanding rate to risk.\nJohn Sauerland: Gary, to that I would add, much of our advertising is mass media, but a massive portion of our advertising spend is in digital media. And that can be sort of displaced up, but it is increasingly what we call digital auctions. And there are multiple digital auction marketplaces on the web these days. And I would give huge kudos to our digital media group, because they use the analytical powers that are inherent in Progressive people and make great real time decisions, meaning where should we spend more? Where should we spend less? They also do it recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So, you can imagine if we have a longer retaining customer that\u2019s direct, we can spend more, if it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So, I think we are pretty good in that space. And that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now. The other important thing to do is once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit quoting process. And we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to buy it. So, I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there.\nTricia Griffith: And the only thing I would say, this is a little bit off. But once they're in and you do have an incident or an accident, I believe we have industry-leading claim service. We're out there. We care. We're there when you need us the most. I talked about that a lot when there\u2019s cats that we can't control the weather, all we can control is how we treat you as a customer. And we've always gotten really high marks on that. Did you have another question, Gary?\nGary Ransom: Yes. I just going to follow up on the 25% ad spend to, based on what you said is that, is it reasonable to assume that a lot of that growth was more in the digital space?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. When we look over the years and we look at, take the last 10, 15 years, and we looked when people bought on phones, so now when they're buying a digital, it is the highest rate of growth.\nGary Ransom: Yes. And just one a little more on the same topic just is, if I look at the body of science that you're putting into this in terms of the quoting process and all of that, and kind of compare it to the body of science you have for matching price and risk, are they both just as robust?\nTricia Griffith: I think so. I mean, I think, when you look at our ability to continue to have new product models coming out where we can even more accurately price rates or risk and get to that preferred customer. We just continued to excel in that. And then on the buying analytical side, I'll concur with John. We have an incredible team. We do a lot of our buying in-house. So, it's proprietary to us. We have an incredible team that understands both the art and science around branding, and then getting in our customers at or below our allowable costs. So, both are highly analytical teams of people that we continue to invest in.\nGary Ransom: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response to the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAdam Klauber: Thanks. Good morning. Excuse me. Commercial \u2013 the commercial auto is clearly growing cars comparisons, but I think you called out that the \u2013 for hire is growing rapidly. And again, that makes sense with the economy taken off, but I guess, what are you doing different in that line of business? And in particular is more of that business being distributed through the direct and digital?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I think we know we were ready, not intentionally, but when the pandemic happened and more truck drivers decided to go from big firms to their own by their own tractor trailer, because spot rate coverage went up. So, we were ready and we're priced well. And we look at that very closely because we've grown substantially both on the direct side and agency side. We \u2013 for many years, we sold the majority of our \u2013 all of our commercial auto on the agency side. But again, we want to be where, when and how our customers want to shop. So, there was, for commercial auto overall, not necessarily for hire trucking. The highest growth in the direct commercial auto ever came in March of this year. And that's when we normalize for four- or five-week month. It only bested by January of this year and then August of last year. So, we were ready to kind of make hay when the sun shines, we are ready for when this happened, we feel great about the trends and the underlying costs. We also are careful about that because it is high limits coverage. And so, we have selected a 12% severity trend making us very comfortable with our reserves. I think we're in the right place at the right time. We feel like we're more than actually reserved. And we're excited about this new business on both the direct and agency.\nAdam Klauber: Right. Okay. And then my follow-up in your letter, you mentioned that VMT is down 8% to 10% versus prior years through the end of March and the first week of April, you say that frequency of claims compared to last year is coming up, but in end of March, early April, but it's frequency of claims. How does frequency of claims in the end of March early April compared to say 2017 to 2019?\nTricia Griffith: Well, compare it \u2013 let's go first and compare it to what's happening now. So VMTs were down about 10% to 12% March early April. Then it went down to 8% to 10%. It\u2019s back up to 10% to 12%. Claims has not caught up yet. We are starting just in \u2013 really recent data starting to see features grow, hasn't caught up yet. Not surprising compared to 2017 through 2019, what would you say, John?\nJohn Sauerland: Well, so we don't actually provide our raw frequency numbers. So, I'm sure you're trying to do that math yourself. And we're not giving you the exact data for. Recognize as well that overall frequency trends for a number of years now have been negative. Obviously with the pandemic, it took a step function down. We look at the frequency, we looked at a lot of things not only versus 2019, but sort of a range of 2017 to 2019 and frequency is still down from we'll call that generally that area, but recognized as well, but before the pandemic frequency was dropping. So, I'm sure we're trying to do a look through to what it was April, May, June, et cetera, look like, and it's even difficult for us to know. But I wouldn't forget those long-term frequency trends for a lot of reasons. I have been negative and of course over the longer-term offset, more than offset by severity, and that's why the industry has been growing. But I would think through that when you're trying to project that frequency is going to look like for the rest of the year.\nAdam Klauber: Thanks a lot.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Just a follow-up on loss trends. Are you anticipating any delays in seeing claims as the economy reopened? I'm thinking about medical procedures that might've been delayed during a pandemic. I mean, are you booking extra IBNR for that possibility?\nTricia Griffith: Well, when we get an injury claim or a PIP claim or a medical claim, well, specifically injury we are \u2013 we have an estimate on what we believe will be the cost depending again, how long that claim is open and what actually happened. And then the adjusters can come in and see if they believe it's less or more, and it can be influenced by data as it unfolds. I think early on, we saw sort of a stall not necessarily in treatments, but more importantly, I think surgeries and of course, there's not a huge amount of surgeries in BI. A lot of our injuries are soft tissue injuries. And so, on a lot of those can even heal on their own. What we did see was a closure of course, and so we can see that open up as well. But I don't \u2013 but with that data that we have years and years\u2019 worth should already be priced in.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. Also in your view, what is the quality of drivers in the for-hire space as folks are looking for employment?\nTricia Griffith: I think that varies. I think that really varies. We feel great about the business that we are putting on our book. We watch that very closely. I think a lot of it depends just like an auto on driver maturity. And right now, with the driver shortage, we can see \u2013you can see that changing overall in the industry. We have not seen that, but we'll watch that closely to make sure again that we price rate to risk for that segment.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Tracy.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I know, Tricia, you talked in the past about how severity is reasonably predictable in auto and frequency left though. So, you have to respond to that. I was hoping you could talk about how you do that in the context of the property book, where policies are 12 months rather than six?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I think we \u2013 largely in property, we look at the age of the structure or the age of the roof. The location is in a hail prone stay, et cetera. And that's right now. We're going to continue to understand deeper segmentation in the property space. And so, I think that will change over time and we'll have more variables that we look at, even on the property side, really the property \u2013 the outcome, the CR has been really solely on catastrophes and freely a lot in Texas. I mean, there has been several things in Texas that have happened, but we look at that. And because of that we \u2013 I talked about the rate increases we put into place last year and next year. We will also look at making sure that we have certain restrictions where we believe we may or may not want to grow. Do you want to add anything John to that?\nJohn Sauerland: No. I think it's very similar. And obviously the models use what we call a trend to date with those trends that take into account durations of policies. You mentioned property as being 12 months. The commercial business is predominantly 12 months as well. And we have I think it's close to 10% now and our agency book on 12-month policy somewhere around there. So, it's the same process. It's just a further out trend to generally.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. If we can switch quickly to the small, I guess the BOP size of commercial. Does the current competitive environment change the timeline for Progressive wrapping up there?\nTricia Griffith: Well, when the pandemic initially started, we'd rolled out BOP in a few states and we kind of took a pause, to reassess not whether we're going to go in, but just reassess sort of what states we want to do audit, our computer system, et cetera. And we're now rolling out very quickly, many, many states. We're very excited about it. Remember when we think about small business, we think about employees of 20 or less almost micro businesses that is growing very rapidly, albeit on a very small base. So, we're excited about what we're learning. We feel good about where we're at from a rate perspective. And Karen can talk about this more in August. I mean when we have our conference you know, there's a lot of questions on commercial. And I'll have our outline where we're at on all the VMTs and especially BOP in small business and fleet. But no, we're very excited to continue to roll that out aggressively.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Your next response is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Tricia.\nTricia Griffith: Hi, Brian.\nBrian Meredith: Quick question here for you. Could we [indiscernible] rate or the average written premium per policy decline a little bit here. How much of that is rate-driven, the minus 3% versus how much is just rising deductibles or changes in coverage is that the customers had been implementing during the economic downturn?\nTricia Griffith: I would say the majority of it is our rates \u2013 are reduction in rates. We had several customers call in sometimes they were delaying payments, but not huge changes in coverages. I would say rate would be the primary reason behind our reduction average written premium.\nBrian Meredith: Great. That's helpful. And then my second question, I'm just curious. So, I know a lot of homeowners and policies have we'll call it an inflation card, your inflation protection within them that both in that kind of gradually raise your premiums over time to account for inflation. Does your auto insurance policies carry that as well as that perhaps a potential offset here if we do see some rising in severity?\nTricia Griffith: We have some things that we hadn't placed for years. That actually take a factor into place every month for inflation on the auto side.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes, to a certain degree that transpires in home generally the home is driven predominantly by the replacement cost inflation. So, something like lumber would be factored into how we would assess your replacement costs at your renewal. On the auto side, we have built in what we call monthly rating factors. So, this is just an acknowledgement that generally speaking over time. Trend in average losses is positive. And so, we bake that into the pricing algorithm so that every month we see modest increases in premiums in those states. We don't have those in all states. It's not a huge impact on average premium. It does help ensure, all else equal a positive trend in average payment in auto.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for taking more than one question from me. I appreciate it. I noticed that sequential policy count growth in property was the best in March 2021, since I guess going back to September 2018. I know there's a lot of new housing starts and now people are moving out and whatnot, but also there's the amount of appetite that Progressive might have for warning those risks. It does seem that your growth in property slowed down in the last two years and maybe it's accelerating right now. Can we talk a little about appetite? How it relates to both your desire to convert to Robinson and in general? How it related to cat aggregation and whatnot, and is the funnel opening up for property compared to where it was a year ago?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I think, it depends on [indiscernible] a couple of things, one, we've invested a lot on the direct side with our HomeQuote Explorer HQX, so having Progressive property and other third-party not affiliated companies we work with. So, we've continued to do that and continue to have more and more of those companies have a buy button, which makes it really easy to be able to combine the auto home and buy it online.  On the agency side, we've increased our platinum agents have a little bit over 4,000 platinum agents now. So again, more ability to divide us. We want to make money on the property side. And so, we have been, I think we're in 47 states now. We want to go across the country. And for years, we were \u2013 we had a lot of density in Texas, Florida, that area, and we continue to do, but we also want to grow out of those and do the right thing in terms of segmentation. So, our appetite is we want to grow as fast as we can. But our other part of that of course is we want to make our target profit margins. So, we look at those days, we look at x cat to try to understand where we believe the underlying price is accurate. And as I said, we are increasing rates and trying to understand segmentation a little bit more deeply. So, we want to grow there. We want to grow Robinson that's one of the reasons why we've made so many big investments but we need to make money on that product.\nJosh Shanker: Can you give us any sense about how did the percentage of auto policies you have that are bundled whether by a Progressive property policy or a HomeQuote Explorer policy?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, the HomeQuote Explorer. So, I would say overall in Robinsons take that we're about 10%.\nJosh Shanker: 10% of your auto market shares drop at this point.\nTricia Griffith: Yes.\nJosh Shanker: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next response is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks for taking another question from me. Tricia, I just wanted to just maybe talk about the road test offering in a bit more detail and just see where that stands. If you have plans to roll it out on a broader scale and how much \u2013 how traction has been there?\nTricia Griffith: What we've been \u2013 we continue to be challenged a little bit with the economics on road test. So, we're redefining some of the metrics and I would stay on that more to come. We continue to develop there, but we need to make the economics work.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And what is it about the economics? Maybe flush that out a little bit like, what is the sticking point that you see that make it hard for the economics to work there?\nTricia Griffith: There's several different things. I'd rather have us outline exactly what's working, one is working and hopefully that'll be soon.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay. That's fair. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next response is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. My first question, you guys obviously just announced the Protective acquisition and I recognize, you're waiting kind of, so that closes to give us more details there, but just since you brought me think about additional M&A from here, I know obviously Progressive as often shied away from M&A except in a couple of unique circumstances. So, can you just provide us kind of your current view and anything that might cause you to pursue additional transactions down the road?\nTricia Griffith: We have corporate development department that is under Andrew Quigg and our strategy group. It always kind of like searches a landscape to see things. Acquisitions are hard and it's hard for us specifically, I think because of our culture. And that's why the limited number that we've done, we have felt have great products, great culture fit with us and can be cumulative. So, I've talked a few times about the ASI acquisition. We didn't have the ability to bundle customers in agency channel that gives us that. We talked a little bit about the Protective and thank you for allowing us to talk more about that after the transaction closes. So, I will always look at what does it bring to Progressive that we can't grow organically, or that will help us get to market faster. And that's kind of how I see it. And we're always thinking of look, but again, I want to be able to doesn't give us access to customers, access to technology, or the ability to get the market faster is kind of how I look at acquisitions.\nElyse Greenspan: Right. And then my second question you had mentioned that Snapshot Apron Relief product last quarter on, and then there was a little bit of color within your letter in the Q. But I was just wondering it seems like it's still early, but are there any like observations that you've noticed kind of some switching like that shorter driving period relative to other products and just in general observation?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So, we haven't in 43 states and we, again, like you said Elyse, so I could unfold. We sent out communications to about 14 million customers and about 40,000 of those enrolled so to have that 30 days. So far 9,400 have reached that 30-day point and a pretty small percentage about 4% have called us to join the program. And we still feel very proud of the fact that we did that because it does allow people to reduce their rates if they're driving lives or their behavior of driving differs. So again, we still have some time before all the customers roll out, but a relatively small percentage has actually joined the Snapshot program.\nElyse Greenspan: Is the idea to keep this going like, obviously it was tied right to the pandemic and the impact that\u2019s had on driving behavior? But the idea to keep an option of a shorter driving monitor period available indefinitely, or is there kind of normally might have this for a certain time period.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We have this program in place till July this year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nDoug Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time. So that concludes our event. Tamara, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019 first quarter investor event. Information about the replay of the event will be available on the investor relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollout brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next for the positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19% and we reported a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable with the exception of Property, where catastrophic weather loss is added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continues to be strong at 12%. And I'm most excited to report that we pass the milestones of 17 million Personal Auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs, and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004, that we reported double digit growth in personal auto, special lines and commercial lines policies in force. We couldn't be proud of that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets.  I'd like to take some time to address the effects that pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So, it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March, 2021 results. And to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons. This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects two items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping, virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of that pandemic growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example, why since the denominator was only nominally affected by dependent. Last year's new business metrics continued to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020. So not always negatively. In mid-April, 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks, were released which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter, 2021 year-over-year, new business growth. Also starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief Program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our personal auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our positive retention. Both, policy enforced counts and retention metrics, were affected by billing leniency. In Commercial Lines, our TNC business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles to be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines, net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. Our property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, property business suffered significant losses. Further the hail storms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll more details on the late April events and our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and it was helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was a desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic. One in which senior managers from around the organization will present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least two of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight commercial lines. Looking forward into the rest of the 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think, pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question Tamara. Yes, we are actually assessing that right now. When we look at the gap in PD and collision, at least one other competitor has similar results. We believe in part it is due to our CWP rates being different in PD and collision. So right now, Elyse, we're having a Gary Traicoff group and our Claims Control group dig in a little bit deeper. The reporting is similar CDP rate is different. So, we're trying to discern exactly what that is. I think whenever we acquire new business, we're obviously going to spend more for it in terms of both advertising which you saw increase 25% in the direct sliding commission. So, I don't know that the penalty is extraordinary, John, you can weigh in little bit on that. The renewal, one, we're proud of our service and our rates. So, we know that some of the retention gains are likely due to what has happened during a pandemic in terms of non-cancellation, et cetera. But I wouldn't say that there is a big penalty. I'm sorry about that Elyse we have a lot of acronyms here. It's claims without payments. So, claims that come in and then we close them because we no longer see an exposure. I mean the history of our commission, right, so we try to look at in aggregate right around 10, 10.5. And then it's different depending on the type of customer that comes in, if things are bundled, we obviously have several thousand Platinum agents to get a higher commission because they are bundling the auto and home those Robinson's customers. And so, if you bring in a group of customers that we believe are going to be there short term, the commission might be less. Again, the aggregate is, we try to keep around 10%, 10.5%. And we also do have some preferred programs and bonuses for agents depending on their loss performance. It's not across the Board, it's with specific agents. Do you want to add anything John? Yes. No, we do not want to be a loss leader. Profit is one of our core values. We have a very specific target margin for our property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96. We have just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So, if you look at over the years, how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick rate, our segmentation, in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in homes. So, we have new product models, we have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be your roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in they hail prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that that really causes a lot. In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So, in 2020 we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1, and we have another 4.2 expected in quarter two. So, we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal. Now, what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of a bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is without having a property product, we would not have gotten, likely we would have not gotten most of those autos. So, we want those. But we want to make our target margins across the Board period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have \u2013 along with the industry, have been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have, re-insurance, heavily re-insurance on the property side to protect the downside. But we're not thrilled with those results and we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal. Thank you, Greg. Thanks Michael. We've been testing and looking into claims and Snapshot, understanding the facts of loss, fraud, other things for quite some time. I think we've had 150,000 customers that we currently have access to claims information, should they have a loss. And we'll have more to come on that. We've been working on that for a while. But we think it is an important next step for the use in our Telematics. And we've talked often on too about do we have continuous monitoring? Would that help, not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also can help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows, and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work-from-home versus not work-from-home, et cetera, as well as some of the other items we've talked about the Apron Relief. So, I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they are driving less the ability to prove that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades, we'll continue to do so, we do so on both the personal auto and the commercial outside, really happy with our smart hall results very successful. And the program is very profitable on the commercial auto side because that's a big expense for truckers. I mean all of those things are on our agenda and we continued to invest a lot in this area. Yes, great question. I'll use the G-word. So yes, GEICO did, Berkshire talked a lot about it and they are a formidable competitor. And we liked the competition because it makes us better instead for customers. Here is how we think about segmentation. We've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now, and we're not going to stop. And we believe rate to risk has a lot to do as many different variables. Insurance, credit scores being one of them, usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So, I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many billion miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the commercial auto side. So, we like the competition we think it was great. And now ten years ago, I might not have said this. But now we have head-to-head brands. So, you may like her, or you may not, but you know who flow is, and we're very proud of flow, the network and all the different characters. So, I think going head-to-head on all those things is a good thing. I've always been a competitive, and we like that. I think it makes us better. It makes sure that you don't just rest on your laurels. So, we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables, as well as our brand, our broad coverage, and the people and culture at Progressive. And we think all those together are really winning formula. Yes, so we're very happy about the increase in Robinson. That's really what our goal has been to have those bundled customers. We've added some platinum agents on the agency side. I would say, our total book of Robinson right now is right around 10%, which is a much higher than it was many years ago. So, we continue to kind of gain that momentum in Robinson. And what was the other part of your question? Profitability. Yes, they are preferred customers, so we believe they are more profitable. And on the retention side the retention is dramatically different not just on the Robinson side, but as you have, more and more policies with us. So that's why it's so important for us to continue to give people a reason to stay for decades and decades, to be able to have products that can all come from the same care, whether or not we write it on our paper or not. So yes, so that's the preferred customer, and we want wider margins there and the retention is longer. I wish I knew the answer to that question. That is such a tough one. We are seeing some losses come back, especially now, it makes sense on the special lines side, we'll watch that closely. We haven't been affected yet from the semiconductor shortage. We watched those things closely. Some of the severity, we'll look at in terms of our average premium is down a little bit, and we've had a lot of cat losses. So, all those things play into it. And then of course it really does, like you said, it plays into it in terms of what do people do as different states open. So, will there be more highway travel because you are packing up the kids to go see grandma and grandpa, that may cause less volatile accidents we've been seeing. Obviously, the congestion is less in the pandemic than it will be. So, we are watching all of those things closely. And we're going to be able to react to those. And we've never been in this situation. So, we will watch closely with not just our UBI data, but some other data that we're starting to gleam in terms of understanding when more people are starting to work from the office. And so, we have some occupations and some data that shows some people are already there, some people are there a little bit more often. We're going to continue to watch that because, we think that could creep up pretty quickly and we want to be on top of that. Well, we look at all the trends in terms of what we do. So, after we took to credits, then we looked across the Board and we looked state by state, product by product, channel by channel, and our goal was always to take small bites of the apple because our customers, we know they want rate stability. And so, we felt great at the end of this year and now we're doing the same thing. We're taking a look and different states have very different attributes in terms of increases in frequency and severity and driving behavior. So that less than 1% is just based on us, looking at the data and making tweaks. And we'll do that the rest of this year as we see things unfold. So, it's really using the data and then saying, okay, we need a little bit more on in this product, in this data, in this channel. And that's why, I think, the way we're set up is so good because we're a machine that can react pretty quickly to those trends as they unfold. Thanks. Thanks, Josh. And actually, for years, if you go back, we presented this in IR meeting probably maybe seven or eight years ago. We saw that shopping when people get their earned income tax stimulus from the government. And it is largely Sams. It is other people that I think other constituents that have lost their insurance or couldn't afford to it. But in the large part Sams, and our theory in Sams, we grew up with them. We love them as long as it can make our target margin. So, the stimulus just exacerbated that. These are people that are trying to do the right thing and maybe lost coverage and want to get back in the game and be legal and do the right thing. So, we see this and other stimulus that started in and will continue to be something where we'll increase shopping behavior for the industry as a whole, but yes, in large part is it is predominantly Sams. We look at all the macroeconomics that are going on and react to that on a severity basis. I would say on the rental coverage, especially for our first party, we have contracts in place to minimize the amount that you pay per day on a rental. So, we feel good about that. We also believe on the rental side that, if you get out there and see the car, customers want their car back in their driveway. So, we really do try to compress the time with which to get the car back into at or better shape than before the accident. So, we've always pride ourselves on the actual time that takes, which of course affects rental. On lumber, we will start to see that unfold. And if we believe that it is a piece of the severity, we will price that in future rate increases. Thanks, Josh. Yes, Gary. I think a lot of it is our brand. So, we started out \u2013 I started out one of the answers with 10 years ago, 11 years ago, our brand would be different. It's about awareness and people know who Progressive is. They know our brand is a solid brand, is a reputable brand. So that's kind of awareness gets you on the short list. And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door. So, we believe that \u2013 we've obviously spent a lot more on brand and other 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we were spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So, if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad, or you want to call in, or you want to go to your agent, we try to be where, when and how you want to shop just to make it easy for our customers. And then you have competitive prices. So, I think that is really important and that goes, of course, into our segmentation and understanding rate to risk. And the only thing I would say, this is a little bit off. But once they're in and you do have an incident or an accident, I believe we have industry-leading claim service. We're out there. We care. We're there when you need us the most. I talked about that a lot when there's cats that we can't control the weather, all we can control is how we treat you as a customer. And we've always gotten really high marks on that. Did you have another question, Gary? Yes. When we look over the years and we look at, take the last 10, 15 years, and we looked when people bought on phones, so now when they're buying a digital, it is the highest rate of growth. I think so. I mean, I think, when you look at our ability to continue to have new product models coming out where we can even more accurately price rates or risk and get to that preferred customer. We just continued to excel in that. And then on the buying analytical side, I'll concur with John. We have an incredible team. We do a lot of our buying in-house. So, it's proprietary to us. We have an incredible team that understands both the art and science around branding, and then getting in our customers at or below our allowable costs. So, both are highly analytical teams of people that we continue to invest in. Thanks, Gary. Yes, I think we know we were ready, not intentionally, but when the pandemic happened and more truck drivers decided to go from big firms to their own by their own tractor trailer, because spot rate coverage went up. So, we were ready and we're priced well. And we look at that very closely because we've grown substantially both on the direct side and agency side. We \u2013 for many years, we sold the majority of our \u2013 all of our commercial auto on the agency side. But again, we want to be where, when and how our customers want to shop. So, there was, for commercial auto overall, not necessarily for hire trucking. The highest growth in the direct commercial auto ever came in March of this year. And that's when we normalize for four- or five-week month. It only bested by January of this year and then August of last year. So, we were ready to kind of make hay when the sun shines, we are ready for when this happened, we feel great about the trends and the underlying costs. We also are careful about that because it is high limits coverage. And so, we have selected a 12% severity trend making us very comfortable with our reserves. I think we're in the right place at the right time. We feel like we're more than actually reserved. And we're excited about this new business on both the direct and agency. Well, compare it \u2013 let's go first and compare it to what's happening now. So VMTs were down about 10% to 12% March early April. Then it went down to 8% to 10%. It's back up to 10% to 12%. Claims has not caught up yet. We are starting just in \u2013 really recent data starting to see features grow, hasn't caught up yet. Not surprising compared to 2017 through 2019, what would you say, John? Thank you. Well, when we get an injury claim or a PIP claim or a medical claim, well, specifically injury we are \u2013 we have an estimate on what we believe will be the cost depending again, how long that claim is open and what actually happened. And then the adjusters can come in and see if they believe it's less or more, and it can be influenced by data as it unfolds. I think early on, we saw sort of a stall not necessarily in treatments, but more importantly, I think surgeries and of course, there's not a huge amount of surgeries in BI. A lot of our injuries are soft tissue injuries. And so, on a lot of those can even heal on their own. What we did see was a closure of course, and so we can see that open up as well. But I don't \u2013 but with that data that we have years and years' worth should already be priced in. I think that varies. I think that really varies. We feel great about the business that we are putting on our book. We watch that very closely. I think a lot of it depends just like an auto on driver maturity. And right now, with the driver shortage, we can see \u2013you can see that changing overall in the industry. We have not seen that, but we'll watch that closely to make sure again that we price rate to risk for that segment. Thanks, Tracy. Yes, I think we \u2013 largely in property, we look at the age of the structure or the age of the roof. The location is in a hail prone stay, et cetera. And that's right now. We're going to continue to understand deeper segmentation in the property space. And so, I think that will change over time and we'll have more variables that we look at, even on the property side, really the property \u2013 the outcome, the CR has been really solely on catastrophes and freely a lot in Texas. I mean, there has been several things in Texas that have happened, but we look at that. And because of that we \u2013 I talked about the rate increases we put into place last year and next year. We will also look at making sure that we have certain restrictions where we believe we may or may not want to grow. Do you want to add anything John to that? Well, when the pandemic initially started, we'd rolled out BOP in a few states and we kind of took a pause, to reassess not whether we're going to go in, but just reassess sort of what states we want to do audit, our computer system, et cetera. And we're now rolling out very quickly, many, many states. We're very excited about it. Remember when we think about small business, we think about employees of 20 or less almost micro businesses that is growing very rapidly, albeit on a very small base. So, we're excited about what we're learning. We feel good about where we're at from a rate perspective. And Karen can talk about this more in August. I mean when we have our conference you know, there's a lot of questions on commercial. And I'll have our outline where we're at on all the VMTs and especially BOP in small business and fleet. But no, we're very excited to continue to roll that out aggressively. Hi, Brian. I would say the majority of it is our rates \u2013 are reduction in rates. We had several customers call in sometimes they were delaying payments, but not huge changes in coverages. I would say rate would be the primary reason behind our reduction average written premium. We have some things that we hadn't placed for years. That actually take a factor into place every month for inflation on the auto side. Yes, I think, it depends on [indiscernible] a couple of things, one, we've invested a lot on the direct side with our HomeQuote Explorer HQX, so having Progressive property and other third-party not affiliated companies we work with. So, we've continued to do that and continue to have more and more of those companies have a buy button, which makes it really easy to be able to combine the auto home and buy it online.  On the agency side, we've increased our platinum agents have a little bit over 4,000 platinum agents now. So again, more ability to divide us. We want to make money on the property side. And so, we have been, I think we're in 47 states now. We want to go across the country. And for years, we were \u2013 we had a lot of density in Texas, Florida, that area, and we continue to do, but we also want to grow out of those and do the right thing in terms of segmentation. So, our appetite is we want to grow as fast as we can. But our other part of that of course is we want to make our target profit margins. So, we look at those days, we look at x cat to try to understand where we believe the underlying price is accurate. And as I said, we are increasing rates and trying to understand segmentation a little bit more deeply. So, we want to grow there. We want to grow Robinson that's one of the reasons why we've made so many big investments but we need to make money on that product. Yes, the HomeQuote Explorer. So, I would say overall in Robinsons take that we're about 10%. Yes. What we've been \u2013 we continue to be challenged a little bit with the economics on road test. So, we're redefining some of the metrics and I would stay on that more to come. We continue to develop there, but we need to make the economics work. There's several different things. I'd rather have us outline exactly what's working, one is working and hopefully that'll be soon. Thank you. We have corporate development department that is under Andrew Quigg and our strategy group. It always kind of like searches a landscape to see things. Acquisitions are hard and it's hard for us specifically, I think because of our culture. And that's why the limited number that we've done, we have felt have great products, great culture fit with us and can be cumulative. So, I've talked a few times about the ASI acquisition. We didn't have the ability to bundle customers in agency channel that gives us that. We talked a little bit about the Protective and thank you for allowing us to talk more about that after the transaction closes. So, I will always look at what does it bring to Progressive that we can't grow organically, or that will help us get to market faster. And that's kind of how I see it. And we're always thinking of look, but again, I want to be able to doesn't give us access to customers, access to technology, or the ability to get the market faster is kind of how I look at acquisitions. Yes. So, we haven't in 43 states and we, again, like you said Elyse, so I could unfold. We sent out communications to about 14 million customers and about 40,000 of those enrolled so to have that 30 days. So far 9,400 have reached that 30-day point and a pretty small percentage about 4% have called us to join the program. And we still feel very proud of the fact that we did that because it does allow people to reduce their rates if they're driving lives or their behavior of driving differs. So again, we still have some time before all the customers roll out, but a relatively small percentage has actually joined the Snapshot program. Yes. We have this program in place till July this year. Thanks, Elyse."

            "content": "I would agree. The new business growth is certainly a function of the dominator. We recognize that, but it's also a function of 25% more advertising spend. And we always like to reiterate that we are only spending when we believe it to be efficient. But in terms of a penalty, the mix in terms of policies and premium, new to renewal is fairly stable, even when you're growing your business a lot and the business are as mature as our businesses are. I was just going to clarify this trend for close without payments for collision has been going down. It's actually predates the pandemic and for property damage has been going up. So that obviously affects the total frequency number. Tamara next question. The 10.5% that Tricia is siting is generally where we run in our auto business. On the property side, we have a higher commission rate. But the overarching objective here is to ensure we have competitive prices, that means we have to have competitive commissions as well as competitive other costs when we call non-acquisition expense ratio or costs. And so really, it's the combination of go-to-market in terms of having a competitive, aggregate expense ratio, both of those come into play and obviously a condition in which we think our agents will thrive. So there has been downward movement from competitors. You are right. I think we have seen some positives to that to some degree, because our commissions are more like competitors these days than perhaps, they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact of that. That's where we're going. The other thing, I don't know if we call it Telematics or not, that is evolving is dash cam video. So especially in the commercial space, those devices are frequently one in the same and the higher limits in the commercial space if you have a video, it can be extremely helpful in resolving claims because some of those vehicles are targeted because of the limits. And if you have video that clearly shows in which staged it resolves the claims very quickly. So, Telematics is certainly a benefit, obviously profitability and rating side, as Tricia mentioned, evolving for claims for personal and evolving for commercial as well, including dash cam video. Profitability. The target, just for clarification, across the customer segments for auto on a lifetime basis is consistent. So obviously our loss costs vary at times. And frankly, during the pandemic more preferred customers who have the ability to work-from-home have been driving less than other customers whose professions require them to drive to the office. So, while we might have different margins by segment in the near term due to extenuating circumstances, our target margin across those customer segments is consistent, it's 96. Yes, Josh, as you know, our insurance is an interesting product because you truly don't know the cost of goods sold until a year from now in case of home. But the rate indications is what we call them forward looking process to say, what should I price level be over the coming 12, 18, whatever months. We are selecting trends for frequency and severity, and they are informed as Tricia said by macro and economical views, but also a little more specific views such as the cost of lumber. But obviously, that is a near term spike over the long term. We're not sure where that goes. And we would have taken a little more holistic approach to selecting in that case, the severity trend for the price level going forward. Gary, to that I would add, much of our advertising is mass media, but a massive portion of our advertising spend is in digital media. And that can be sort of displaced up, but it is increasingly what we call digital auctions. And there are multiple digital auction marketplaces on the web these days. And I would give huge kudos to our digital media group, because they use the analytical powers that are inherent in Progressive people and make great real time decisions, meaning where should we spend more? Where should we spend less? They also do it recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So, you can imagine if we have a longer retaining customer that's direct, we can spend more, if it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So, I think we are pretty good in that space. And that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now. The other important thing to do is once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit quoting process. And we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to buy it. So, I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there. Well, so we don't actually provide our raw frequency numbers. So, I'm sure you're trying to do that math yourself. And we're not giving you the exact data for. Recognize as well that overall frequency trends for a number of years now have been negative. Obviously with the pandemic, it took a step function down. We look at the frequency, we looked at a lot of things not only versus 2019, but sort of a range of 2017 to 2019 and frequency is still down from we'll call that generally that area, but recognized as well, but before the pandemic frequency was dropping. So, I'm sure we're trying to do a look through to what it was April, May, June, et cetera, look like, and it's even difficult for us to know. But I wouldn't forget those long-term frequency trends for a lot of reasons. I have been negative and of course over the longer-term offset, more than offset by severity, and that's why the industry has been growing. But I would think through that when you're trying to project that frequency is going to look like for the rest of the year. No. I think it's very similar. And obviously the models use what we call a trend to date with those trends that take into account durations of policies. You mentioned property as being 12 months. The commercial business is predominantly 12 months as well. And we have I think it's close to 10% now and our agency book on 12-month policy somewhere around there. So, it's the same process. It's just a further out trend to generally. Yes, to a certain degree that transpires in home generally the home is driven predominantly by the replacement cost inflation. So, something like lumber would be factored into how we would assess your replacement costs at your renewal. On the auto side, we have built in what we call monthly rating factors. So, this is just an acknowledgement that generally speaking over time. Trend in average losses is positive. And so, we bake that into the pricing algorithm so that every month we see modest increases in premiums in those states. We don't have those in all states. It's not a huge impact on average premium. It does help ensure, all else equal a positive trend in average payment in auto."

I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today\u2019s event. The Company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the Company\u2019s website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CE and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was among the toughest years of Progressive\u2019s 85 years. The continued effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the largest hurricane in our history all played a role in a tumultuous environment. Throughout these challenges, Progressive people came together in unity and delivered once again beating our goal of a calendar year 96 combined ratio while growing both written premiums and policies in force. The pride that I feel in all of the people of Progressive is indescribable. We have met all challenges head on and continued to deliver the best-in-class results our stakeholders expect. Our ability to meet these challenges is embedded in our culture, which is built on our newly updated four cornerstones, which are who we are, which is our core values, why we are here, which is our purpose. We revised our purpose to be, we exist to help people move forward and live fully. Our modified purpose builds on the legacy of our core values and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress and equity. We modify the purpose to better unify and guide our organization. Where we are headed, which is our vision. We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there, which is the four pillars of our strategy. We\u2019ve updated these two cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive, Progressive. In today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we\u2019ll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation. As we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major personal auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise personal auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends. Based on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we\u2019ve seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion. We\u2019ve now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for personal auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our personal auto PIFs 3% in 2022 while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We\u2019re continuously evaluating our media budget, and we\u2019ll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market. The higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last three years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that the future is unpredictable. So, we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate as needed to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year \u201896 combined ratio. As I said in my annual shareholders letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices pillar, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today\u2019s presentation. Progressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance. We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer\u2019s car at a considerable expense. That first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016, we launched the Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device. Our most recent addition is continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022. In parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering of Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers of electronic-logging devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses. Throughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable, and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers. Through this, we\u2019ve continuously educated our customers where today UBI adoption is at near historical highs. To highlight our UBI products on this call, we\u2019ve invited two Progressive leaders who\u2019ve played significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our personal auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year Progressive veteran. And for the last five years, he has led our personal auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in personal auto UBI. Following Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For nine years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in Commercial Lines, Cory led R&D during the successful rollout of both our commercial auto UBI products. Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving Progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim?\nJim Haas: Thank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive\u2019s Personal Lines Telematics efforts. Today, I\u2019d like to tell you about how we\u2019ve built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed starting with how we\u2019ve continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we\u2019ll be bringing to market soon. First, let\u2019s recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I\u2019ll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote. If the customer elects to sign up, we\u2019ll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term. During the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD-II device that we send them or via an app on the smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in a device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive. We\u2019ll let them know how they\u2019re doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we\u2019ll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms. At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they\u2019ll be done monitoring. I\u2019d mention that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that\u2019s not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer\u2019s rate couldn\u2019t get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn\u2019t go up, no matter how risky they\u2019re driving look. Many companies still employ a model like this today. Of course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It\u2019s about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So, the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease. While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. And we all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance. So, starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about a fifth of customers received a surcharge, a share that we\u2019ve kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but started us on the path to greater accuracy. It\u2019s also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states. Over time, we\u2019ve moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us, first, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%, and finally, to where we are today. We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past too, now up to 40%. We\u2019ve come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it\u2019s important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about a fifth receive a surcharge. Not surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average, while they\u2019re about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren\u2019t receiving a discount. So, the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones. And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, were more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn\u2019t know about material changes in an individual\u2019s driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time. We had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So, we decided to move forward with a partial model. Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn\u2019t all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive. The difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor, and we\u2019ll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program. Having more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively. We\u2019ve increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We\u2019re one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over a quarter of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023. So, while we\u2019ve been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what\u2019s happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our personal auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it\u2019s up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019. So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before. So, that\u2019s the update on what\u2019s been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via traditional rating variables on renewal policy terms. Now, I want to talk about how we\u2019re working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it\u2019s most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us will have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive. We currently have two initiatives in market. The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them. Let me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don\u2019t receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who\u2019s likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual\u2019s quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately. Our second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They\u2019ve been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they\u2019ll sign up to share that data with them. And we\u2019ve been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we\u2019d ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote. Because of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we\u2019re well positioned to execute and benefit from this. To be clear, automakers are in various often early stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly line have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over. So, this isn\u2019t common yet, but we\u2019re excited about the opportunity it represents. We\u2019re already working with two of the largest double makers, General Motors and Toyota, and it\u2019s clear that this population will grow over the coming years. Lastly, I\u2019d like to share some exciting news that doesn\u2019t involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims. We\u2019ve been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently. Still, we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don\u2019t want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we\u2019d be leaving out a lot of others. So, in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We\u2019ll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened. We\u2019ll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help. If we don\u2019t hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we\u2019ll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer\u2019s location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them. We know there are other accident response services available. We think what we\u2019re offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer\u2019s relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive. Additionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we\u2019ll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they\u2019re in Snapshot or not. Third, we\u2019re deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don\u2019t want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don\u2019t. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So, we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help. We only send help if the customer has requested or if we haven\u2019t been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don\u2019t actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We\u2019re able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need. We understand that those are even more urgent than a typical roadside request. We can also help customers notify their family members. Lastly, after an accident, one of consumers\u2019 top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we\u2019re the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data able, we\u2019re able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle it more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or two is dispatched, we\u2019ll actually get that claim started on their behalf. Let me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle for a striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right. Fortunately, no other vehicles were involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insurance vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss. Additionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn\u2019t response to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident that agent dispatched an ambulance and a tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system. We\u2019ve surveyed some of our accident response customers where we\u2019ve gotten has some great feedback. For instance, this customer showed that they were \u201cunable to call for help at the time but help called me.\u201d This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It\u2019s not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though. Here is another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and had the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case though, is that this customer had this accident just two days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered. Unfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it. This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arranged for the tow truck to pick up the car, and we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road. So, it\u2019s not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They\u2019ve told us they value accident response, and we\u2019re excited to make it available to them. We\u2019ll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our personal auto customers over the next year or so. To wrap up, we\u2019re not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We\u2019re clear-eyed about the challenges, but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just the Personal Lines side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets, and Cory Fischer, who\u2019s led Commercial Lines R&D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory?\nCory Fischer: Thanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I\u2019m Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines Product Research and Development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I\u2019d like to share the progress we\u2019ve made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we\u2019re thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It\u2019s why we\u2019re excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I\u2019ve worked with is charged with advancing our commercial auto segmentation leadership position in the market. Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot. To build on that segmentation leadership position we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have two branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are acquired to maintain hours-of-service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate, requiring these truckers to move from paper log books to electronic logging devices. We have recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our Snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer\u2019s consent, we use the data from the trucker\u2019s electronic login device to generate a score and apply a rating factor. Ideally, we access the data during the quote process, just like the process Jim discussed, using data to price new business. If we are not able to get the data, either there are newer venture without driving history, or we don\u2019t have immediate access to their ELD vendor, we provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView on the right is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn\u2019t have an electronic logging device. We market Snapshot ProView as safety and savings. For customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring. We will then use their driving data to generate a score and a factor that\u2019s applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge. In addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they are being driven. It\u2019s a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we have deployed these programs, we have been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate, that is, percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program. We\u2019ve seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we have identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we are genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it\u2019s on. In addition to adoption, we have seen that when quotas enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that\u2019s eligible, but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint even after the discount is applied. That\u2019s not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments at target. Between our significant footprint in the commercial auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we\u2019ve built a substantial commercial auto telematics book of business. That book would be a Top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own. In summary, we are really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we have learned a lot since introducing these programs. One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It\u2019s not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments. For example, we are asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training. With telematics, we are now dealing with hardware and data transmission. We are also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently dealing with global supply chain issues. That\u2019s a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we\u2019ve had to work through. I think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It\u2019s imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that is handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes, and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets. Telematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren\u2019t nearly as effective, transforming big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that personal auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20 some years, has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage. For example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the personal auto Snapshot device. Given the volume that personal auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions.  In terms of big data, personal auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They\u2019ve also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools. To summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim\u2019s group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from. It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment. I\u2019ll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there\u2019s a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data sharing consent or installing the plug-in device. We have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that aren\u2019t currently eligible for one of these programs. We\u2019re looking to expand eligibility. One example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near term plans, we\u2019ll continue to grow our telematics book, and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models. We\u2019re also excited about new data sources and applications. We\u2019re seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dash cams. We\u2019ve been doing a pilot with dash cams for over a year. There\u2019s data from video that we don\u2019t capture today, like following distance, which could be valuable, and as Jim shared, we\u2019re interested in how telematics can help with the claims process. Dash cams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims. We\u2019re also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging Zip code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct. We can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote. Here\u2019s an example. This shows one truck\u2019s driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insured\u2019s address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey and they\u2019ve listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers at garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out, there\u2019s a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It\u2019s hard to tell from this map, but from the data, let\u2019s say 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around. A territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model. I don\u2019t see a time we have a telematics only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution. Wrapping up, we\u2019ve got a great start to our telematics journey. We\u2019ve got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made. And I\u2019m really excited about how we\u2019ll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward. \nDoug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available for -- available live to answer questions, including presenters Jim Haas and Cory Fischer who can answer questions about the UBI presentation. [Instructions] We will now take our first question. Stacy?\nOperator: Our first question for today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey. Great. Good morning and thanks for the presentation. A first question, Progressive\u2019s personal auto accident frequency levels appear to be trending a lot better than the industry over the past year. I\u2019m curious if you agree with that statement. And if you do, any thoughts on what\u2019s causing the better than historical average trend line? And I know, clearly, a lot of this call was devoted to segmentation, Progressive is a first mover -- or one of the first movers in telematics. So, that theoretically should, I guess, improve Progressive\u2019s trend-line versus the industry if I\u2019m thinking about things correctly too. But would love to hear more about that. \nTricia Griffith : Yes. Mike, I think you\u2019re thinking about it in the right way. A couple caveats. When we report frequency, we report incurred in a lot of our competitors report paid, but we\u2019ve been seeing this trend more negative in the industry for a while. We can\u2019t speculate on a lot of things. Obviously, segmentation is a big piece, we believe. We also believe that mix of business could play a role and that could be mix in states or mix overall from a preferred perspective. We talked in the fourth quarter and in my letter about growth across all of our segments that we started to see increase in Q4. We have seen growth again across all segments, but higher in the Diane\u2019s Wrights and Robinsons. Again, we still see it in Sam\u2019s, but it\u2019s higher, so it could be mix as well. The good news is that we see this data change quickly. So, if we need to change anything we\u2019re doing from a pricing perspective, we\u2019ll see it pretty quickly.\nJohn Sauerland: I\u2019d add a couple items on that. So I think Jim Haas\u2019 slide where he showed the retention of customers who are getting a surcharge versus a discount is a great case in point of segmentation at work. So the folks who are getting a surcharge, all else equal, are going to be the higher frequency drivers and the folks who are getting a discount are the lower frequency. And obviously in the marketplace, as that continues to play out, that will help drive our frequency more favorable than our competitors. Additionally, we\u2019ve talked about underwriting efforts we put in place as we were challenged by profitability. We\u2019ve raised rates considerably as we\u2019ve shared. I will note though that we have retained our underwriting restrictions fairly tight. So, we\u2019ve been able to manage that in this very competitive environment to a point where we are able to maintain the underwriting restrictions, which generally speaking are pushing off the higher frequency customers and able to raise rates at the same time. So, I think we are in a pretty good place, both from the rate level perspective but also continuing to guard against segments that might be underpriced.\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up is regarding some of the commentary you made about the automakers. And I know we appreciate that you are not an automaker and you are partnering with them and it\u2019s in the early stages. But I believe you used the word excited about the partnership. And I believe a lot of investors have felt that the automakers could represent a new leg, or new kind of leg of competitiveness within the industry. So curious if you\u2019re having to -- maybe you can shed more light on the partnerships and only if Progressive is having to pay the automakers for this data, why isn\u2019t it a bit of a competitive threat as well? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Sure, Mike. I\u2019ll let Jim Haas talk a little bit more about that. But we think competition across the board, whether it\u2019s with the OEs or with insure-techs is great. We also feel like when we have partnerships like Jim talked about, it\u2019s really important and it benefits most importantly the consumers. So Jim, do you want to add any color to that?\nJim Haas: Sure. Mike, you are right. We obviously pay for the data eventually goes to the automakers, is a way for them to monetize that. They are putting all those hardware in the car that costs money. This is a way for them to get some return on that. Some OEMs are going to want to get an insurance, as we\u2019ve seen, some might not. And so this is a different way for them to get value-add out of that data from us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David, you have the floor.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I believe in August you told us that, you thought auto PIF growth in the next couple of years would be difficult to match the 70% type of PIF growth you guys saw in the six years, since the start of the last hard market in 2016. Just wondering if we could get an update on your thoughts on that front, just given the challenges in the marketplace that some of your peers are seeing, some of the losses they have reported and just how you are feeling with your rates and what you are seeing on the new apps? Just wondering how you -- do you still feel that way just on the type of growth that you think we could see over the next five to six years? \nTricia Griffith: Thanks, David. I will tell you I feel a lot more bullish than I felt about four or five months ago. We went through reacting to severity trends that frankly we\u2019ve never seen before. I can\u2019t predict what PIF growth will be because we -- there\u2019s a lot of environmental things going on, and what I\u2019ve learned over the last three years is to anticipate that there\u2019s going to be things that we haven\u2019t prepared for, whether it\u2019s the used car prices, inflation, frequency, driving behavior, pandemic. That said, I believe we\u2019re in a really great position as we sit. So, we said, we were going to start to take rate. I think, we foreshadowed that late \u201821. It took some time into 2022 to obviously start to earn into the book. We do feel good, but we\u2019re always watching what\u2019s happening and there\u2019s been kind of an ever-evolving changing. So on the private passenger auto side, as you know, we took 13.5 points last year. We still have about 3 points of that to earn in, in this calendar year. And just for some color, we took 1.5 points in January. So, we continue to look at trends, and the future -- and the future trends and the rate need -- that we need now to match rate to risk. But that said, and John Sauerland added this on to the first question from Mike and that is what --we\u2019re in such a good position now because we have -- there\u2019s a lot of shopping out there, a lot of prospects out there because our competitors have been now raising rates. So, they\u2019re catching up just and sometimes exceeding us. But we\u2019re in just a different position, because we got out in front of it. So, there\u2019s a lot of shopping, a lot of ambient shopping, which is really efficient for us. And what happens with what both Jim and Cory talked about, as well as other variables, we believe we have superior segmentation. So, we\u2019re going to grab onto as many customers and obviously keep as many customers as we can for as long as we can. However, this timeframe in this hard market lasts, and of course that segmentation and the adverse selection flywheel works in our favor because of our many, many decades of investing in things like segmentation, competitive prices, our brand, et cetera. So, while I can\u2019t foreshadow what our PIF growth is going to be, we are going to do everything we can to follow our longstanding goal of growing as fast as we possibly can at our 96 combined ratio and making sure we can take care of our customers.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. And maybe just following up there, it sounds like the continuous monitoring that\u2019s been an interesting development that -- I\u2019m interested to hear what sort of impact that has had on underwriting profitability, and growth in the 12 states where you\u2019ve rolled it out. And how we should think about that as you roll it out on more states? Is that something where we can maybe see a step change in terms of profitability or frequency or anything from that perspective just on -- just greater segmentation that you might get from that?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, I think from a cost perspective, obviously continuous is a little bit more expensive, but those costs have gone down over the years. But I think, what we\u2019re excited about and what Jim talked about -- the excitement about is the services that we\u2019re going to provide especially in some of the claims examples. So, we will continue to evolve like we have since 1996 with our UBI products. And we believe that we\u2019ll continue to enhance our ability to out segment our competitors. What that means from the exact amount, we don\u2019t know yet, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor and I\u2019m sure ever so often we\u2019ll update you on where we\u2019re at with our UBI offerings.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Scott: First question I had was just on -- all the potential new business just looking at the application growth and so forth. How is -- how does sort of the growth penalty from new business coming on look in this kind of environment maybe during prior periods?\nTricia Griffith : Yes. You know, I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot because in times where we have high growth, we often talk about the new business penalty. And as I\u2019m thinking about it, penalties from my perspective are something that is done to you because maybe you did something wrong. As an example, Sunday, I was watching our youngest son play Lacrosse. He got a penalty for slashing. He knew it. He was emotional. He did it. He took a knee. We\u2019re a little bit different because the things that we do and the amount that we pay is all controllable. As you witnessed when we pulled back on media and did some other things to make sure we reached our 96. So, from my perspective, what we are paying, so you\u2019ll -- you saw the increase in January and our expense ratio specifically on the direct side because we front load our acquisition costs there. It\u2019s really an investment in our future. It\u2019s an investment for our owners, investment for our customers. So, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re excited to do in terms of how we manage the business? And again, we have the caveats with our ceiling of an aggregate, all business lines, 96 combined ratio. So it\u2019s hard to compare from the past where we\u2019ll go. But we know that this has been a really volatile environment and we have the levers to pull back should we need to and throttle forward should we need to. So, can\u2019t tell you the exact amount. I will tell you that we\u2019re pretty excited about the position we are in right now. And again, we\u2019re Progressive. So, we\u2019re never going to be cocky and we\u2019re always going to be really paranoid and we follow the data maniacally and talk about it all the time. But we are really excited about what we believe this hard market, however long it lasts, brings.\nAlex Scott: Second question I have maybe a little more applicable to the telematics. When I think through this and the pricing advantage that it gives you over some competitors that are not doing it to the same scale or maybe even just to the industry broadly, I appreciate you probably don\u2019t want to like quantify some of these things, but could you kind of talk to us about directionally has that pricing advantage that it provides, has it expanded because of some of the things you\u2019re doing? Or some of these things that you\u2019re doing just allowing sort of your pricing advantage to be maintained as others begin to do more on the telematics front but not to the same degree? Or is it sort of diminishing as more competitors are just like more broadly adopting telematics? I guess, just high level if you could talk about that.\nTricia Griffith : Yes. I\u2019ll talk about it high level and then Jim and Cory can weigh in for their perspective on businesses. But one, it takes a lot to get history of driving behavior and to continuously learn on that. So, I think you have to have a headstart, which is why we sort of did a primer on the history of where we\u2019ve been. We were out ahead of it, obviously, nearly three decades ago. A couple points though, I think the -- and one that Jim made is, I think it\u2019s important to make sure that we are pricing rate to risk. So although customers are never happy when they get a surcharge, when they do and if they go somewhere else again, that\u2019s adverse selection. So there is multiple pieces of not just the, N equals 1, but also what can happen from a competitive perspective. So, to be able to have the UBI as well as our other segmentations to truly understand that rate to risk in what John talked about with our underwriting acumen is also an important piece. I think it\u2019s probably more important on the commercial line side from the perspective of, if I\u2019m a good driver and I drive a truck, can I save money on my insurance, which is a big cost in the commercial line? So I don\u2019t know if Jim or Cory, you want to add anything?\nJim Haas: Personal Lines side, yes, there is certainly more activity in UBI than there was 10 years ago, let\u2019s say. We are just continuing to move our pricing forward, price more aggressively, take more advantage of that regardless of what anybody else is doing. We want to price as accurately as we can, and get as many people into that program as we can.\nCory Fischer: Yes. Thanks, Alex. So for commercial auto, we are the largest commercial auto insurer and we are also number one in truck. And I think with that, we have a lot more data than anyone else. And so, we have, we feel like a leadership position in segmentation. I think telematics extends that leadership position relative to the marketplace. So, there are some companies that are investing in telematics. But I think between our size, the amount of data we have, we believe we are increasing the lead through telematics.\nJohn Sauerland: I\u2019ll just add. So, over the history of the personal auto, evolution in telematics, early on, we weren\u2019t pricing to the full curve. So, we understood that a lot of people should be receiving surcharges, and some people should be receiving bigger discounts. Because we were at the forefront and we are seeking consumer adoption, we didn\u2019t price to that full curve. I think we are now very close to or almost completely pricing to that curve with the data we have today. However, as Jim was sharing, we can continue to advance the science, continue to pull additional data elements that can continue to have us leading the pack. So, our segmentation game is never ending. We are always trying to continue to advance, to find additional data to use that can keep us with a gap between us and the competition. And as Cory mentioned in the prepared comments with the slides, Commercial Lines is at an earlier stage similar to where Personal Lines was. We still have a significant loss ratio benefit in aggregate for telematics and Commercial Lines, which means, we have further pricing options that we can play as competitors come to market with their offering. So, I think we are in a great place from a telematics standpoint. We are not at all at the end of the journey. We are going to continue to evolve and continue to advance our competitive advantage, when it comes to pricing and telematics.\nTricia Griffith: I\u2019ll add one last thing just because I think this is a subtle nuance, so really important. And Cory mentioned it a couple of times. When he\u2019s thinking about telematics in his role, in his prior role and Commercial Lines, he\u2019s talking to Jim and their team. He referred to his colleagues and learnings that they have. This is really common and very specific when you think about our strategic pillars. One is our people and our culture. Our culture is to go back and forth, whether it\u2019s talent and rotational jobs, but understanding learnings from the first movers within the company. That is really key, and I think it\u2019s really different because many of us -- I think Lori Niederst prior to her role when she prior to her role when she was in CHRO, she shared many years ago, the amount of depth in our leadership ranks because we think it\u2019s really important for people to know many sides of the business. So although it\u2019s subtle and it\u2019s hard to measure, the way our culture is and the way our leaders work and the sharing of ideas and successes and opportunities is really important, especially in something like telematics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey. Thanks a lot. Really helpful answer to that prior question, but I\u2019d like to elaborate on it a bit. And just thinking about the fact that -- I don\u2019t know, maybe 80%, 90% plus of the insured Personal Lines population utilizes Cambridge Mobile Telematics. I understand that Progressive\u2019s data and analytics is incredibly robust, the segmentation, you talked about history and data use. But the competitors can see all that. So my question is this replicatable in a very fast fashion? What makes it so hard not to replicate given that you\u2019re all using a similar platform?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I\u2019ll let Jim talk about that more. Similar platform doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re all using the same data or the same models or using the data in the same way. So one, it\u2019s expensive to get into this. Over these last three years, we\u2019ve invested a lot. So, you just can\u2019t all of a sudden turn on, understand your data early on, it\u2019s different. In urban and rural, it\u2019s different with your other segmentation variables. But Cambridge is the platform, but we\u2019re not all sharing the same data and outputting the same exact thing. Jim, do you want to add anything?\nJim Haas: Sure. You\u2019re right. Cambridge Mobile is our partner. We\u2019ve had a great relationship with them. They provide the data collection mechanism that gets embedded in the app. And so, we do get that data from them. And you\u2019re right, most people use them in the industry. I think, what\u2019s different is we own our own algorithm. We use that data the way we want to, and we\u2019ve learned a lot over the years about how to make the most out of that data. And I think you mentioned like everybody can see that. That\u2019s not actually true. Most -- in the entire industry, most algorithms for UBI are filed confidentially in the states. So, those are not shared with all of the competitors. So, we can\u2019t see other companies\u2019 algorithms, they can\u2019t see ours. So, we think we can -- we\u2019ve developed an advantage there, and we can maintain that. We also have an OBD device which we offer some of our customers pick, which gives us another source of data, which we think helps calibrate some of that as well.\nAndrew Kligerman: Very helpful. And that\u2019s pretty amazing, your accident response product, where you\u2019ve got under 12 minutes to solve for some of the stuff on site. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us the fact that the impact on LAE and severity, any loss numbers? Anything you could share there to gain some insight into how that affects your loss ratios?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think that\u2019s just too new. We\u2019re just really dipping into this. We\u2019ll probably have more on that in 18 to 24 months. Again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re interested in. We\u2019ve always been since probably 30 years ago want to make sure that we\u2019re there for our customers and their greatest time of need. So, our -- the biggest thing that we want to do there is to help our customers get help when they need it. And if we can use the data from the impact to start the claim going and get them back into the position they were before the accident, give them that peace of mind. That\u2019s pretty important. And that could relate to a lot of great benefits in terms of retention, et cetera. But again, way too soon to be able to share much on that and we\u2019ll probably have more in a few years.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. And just real quickly, you mentioned 40% increased usage in UBI. Could you tell us the percent adoption, a percent of the overall book of business that you have?\nTricia Griffith: From the new perspective, which is what we share externally, it\u2019s higher in direct. Jim, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, about 15% in the agency channel. A little bit lower? Okay. A little bit lower in the agency channel, and then more in the direct. We offer it to everyone in the direct channel coming in. And obviously, we work with over 40,000 independent agents. Some feel more comfortable making that offering. Not all do it, but we\u2019ve seen an increase since 2019, which makes sense. And it\u2019s a perfect fix if you believe that you drive safely and maybe you\u2019re driving less often for new business across the board as other inflationary pressures hit consumers.\nJohn Sauerland: I\u2019d just add that. So in the direct channel, the take rate is substantially higher than in the agency channel. It also offers that in the commercial space the demand through the agency channel is very robust. So, we\u2019re talking about, especially with Smart Haul, which is generally larger trucks that have higher average insurance costs, the benefit of enrolling in a program like this is substantial. So, agents and consumers or business owners in this case are way more likely to select that as an option and as Cory said is highly predictive in that channel as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, Tricia, goes to some of your initial comments, right? You said that future rate would be driven by loss trend. I mean, I realize that it\u2019s a very volatile environment these days, but what are your expectations for loss trend when we think about 2023?\nTricia Griffith: We will just continue to watch it. That\u2019s why I wanted to give you a little bit of insight in January taking 1.5 points. What we know is that we closely monitor a lot of these trends. And I mentioned a bunch of them. It\u2019s been such a volatile several years that we look at our internal data, UBI data, macroeconomic trends, all I can tell you is that we will be able to react quickly and that\u2019s sort of embedded in everything that we\u2019ve done in the last 85 years. So, when we start to see those or see those trends and experience those trends, we\u2019ll react quickly. And that\u2019s why we feel like we\u2019re in a good position because we were able to react quickly to the severity trends that we started to see in late 2021 and why we\u2019re sitting in the position -- the enviable position we\u2019re in now, to be able to profitably grow.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the UBI side, I thought most of this was opted into right for new business customers. And I know that\u2019s where you just gave some of the percentage. If you\u2019re at current Progressive customer at renewal or just during the length of your policy, can you opt in and choose to use a Snapshot product, if you want to try to lower your rate?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. And we actually did. It was in, I think 2021, maybe or 2022. I\u2019m not sure exactly when we did, but we actually sent out material to our current customers, when trends started to change to make sure that they had that offering. And we had a small group except that. But yes, we want to be able to provide that if it makes sense for each driver. But it\u2019s normally a new business.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. That was when we saw COVID driving down materially and made an offer to our existing customers to save through Snapshot and not many took us up on that offer. So it\u2019s open and available. Customers can do it. They just haven\u2019t taken us up on it significantly.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one more quick one. So you guys mentioned the new product is continuously monitoring. So the state that you\u2019re active in with that Snapshot product, anyone that uses Snapshot has to be continuously monitored or can they opt into a different monitoring period?\nJim Haas: So when they opt into the program, it is -- there is only continuous. You don\u2019t get to pick at that. Obviously, we can\u2019t force them to continue to monitor forever. So, we\u2019ve got sort of -- the program is designed around that and accommodates when people stop giving us data, if they do, but we certainly encourage them to continue to grow that data. The biggest discounts are available that way and the program\u2019s design that we\u2019d be monitoring continuously.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy, you have the floor.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Even though you feel like you\u2019ve approached rate adequacy in most states, I\u2019m wondering, since you are growing quite quickly with lower ad spend, could you get away with getting even more rate? I mean, you did mention some of your competitors are exceeding you guys with rates. Do you feel like, it\u2019s fine to be cheaper than some, given your risk selection?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we want to be competitive and we want to price to future loss trends. So, we continue to look at that and we will increase rates, should we see severity or frequency trends change, and that\u2019s why I did give that data point in January. So we will stay on top of trends and we will continue to grow. And like John said, we haven\u2019t opened up our aperture in terms of not looking at things that are important from our underwriting perspective. So we still have more leverage from that perspective. But now to -- for me, it is all about using the data and pricing accurately as quickly as possible to match each rate to risk.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. Could you also touch upon your initiative to raise retention amongst multiproduct customers that was mentioned in your filing yesterday? What are the key tenants to achieve that?\nTricia Griffith: We know that our customers and I think most consumers with insurance want stable rates. And so we want to be able to have, if possible, even in this kind of volatile environment what we call, small bites of the apple, to not have to increase rates like we had to in 2022 to stay ahead of trends. We also have very many offerings. So, we have whether it is in our Progressive Advantage Agency for we have a stable carrier of home, unaffiliated partners we work with to have more and more of those bundles, Wrights and Robinsons, we will continue to do that. And we really seek long-term to be sort of the destination company. And so whether it\u2019s on our paper or not, we think of that in terms of our pillar of being where, when and how our customers want to shop and buy, so broad coverage. So, on the Personal Lines side, we sell other people\u2019s home, company when it doesn\u2019t necessarily say where we\u2019re going to go. On the Commercial Lines side, we also use our product as well as others for a small business, workers\u2019 comp, GL, et cetera. So, it really is about following the customer and the more we\u2019re able to offer them, even with the Progressive Advantage Agency where it\u2019s -- we work with a lot of different partners ranging from life insurance to travel insurance to jewelry insurance, the more that the customers have and the more that we\u2019ve earned their trust, the longer they stay. So, retention continues to be the holy grail. We\u2019re seeing positive improvement. We\u2019ll continue to report on that as the quarters unfold, but we do know two parts of retention are really about having stable rates and having great service.\nTracy Benguigui: Great. And is there a segment you\u2019re focusing more on? Agency, will that be more a focus versus direct?\nTricia Griffith: No. We focus across the board. They\u2019re a little bit different in terms of control. So, an agent can decide if they want to shop it on behalf of the consumer, but they\u2019re looking at the same thing as consumers are. And that\u2019s making sure that our mutual customers have stable rates with a company with a great brand and great service. But our goal is to extend PLEs across every segment individually and in the aggregate.\nJohn Sauerland: As Tricia was saying, Tracy, we\u2019re continuing to broaden the offerings to our consumers. So, you talked about multi-product households as Tricia was implying those households stay with us a lot longer than single-product households and much longer than our historical core customer of Sam, who we call the inconsistently insured customer. So, our book does continue to shift more towards the Robinson end of the spectrum which is actually the longer retaining end of the spectrum. We have, as Tricia also noted, seen a setback as we\u2019ve had to raise rates aggressively. That is coming back. Our PLEs are starting to trend positively at least on the trailing 3 metric. And the trailing 12 is not yet fully turned, but certainly the trailing 3 is the leading indicator of the trailing 12. So, we are definitely focusing on more multi-product households as we roll out new products in the personal auto space. Increasingly, we find segmentation that can make us more competitive for those preferred customers. Our book continues to shift that way. And as we get to a more stable rating environment, I think you\u2019ll see our PLEs continue to grow as they have been before we had to take a lot of rate.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Shanker at Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Could you please give some insight? You have the policy conversion and new application numbers for the full year 2022, but it seems like something inflected in the fourth quarter. Can you give some indication on what\u2019s happening fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2021 in quote conversion and new policy apps and maybe into \u201823 as well?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We don\u2019t publish new apps on a quarterly basis, but we did want to show it for year-over-year in the opening slides we had. Basically, what happened was shopping started, the hard market started. We were in a good position, and there\u2019s a lot of prospects that began shopping. And we had good coverage at great rates and we were able to convert. So, it\u2019s really sort of when we started to see things turn. We were in a good position for that from a staffing perspective on the sales side and the claims side. But yes, that\u2019s really kind of when we saw the hard market churn. John, you want to add anything? \nJohn Sauerland: Sure. Josh, we do provide you year to date numbers through the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So, if you just assume an equal weighting, you can come to a number, but we also in the presentation showed you actual charts of those. So, you can\u2019t see exactly what the number is, but you come pretty darn close by looking at those charts. So, the short story is conversion was up considerably in the fourth quarter. Prospects were up considerably in the fourth quarter, and obviously new apps as a consequence were up a lot.\nJosh Shanker: And question for the commercial side. Since acquiring Protective, can you talk a little bit about your large fleet offering and how that\u2019s changed?\nJohn Sauerland: Can you repeat the question, please?\nJosh Shanker: I\u2019m sorry. The question was, how has large fleet changed as part of your business since acquiring Protective? \nTricia Griffith: Thanks. Not substantially. Yes. I mean, we\u2019re still learning a lot and the integration\u2019s going really well, and it was really something that was additive to what we were growing from our small fleet. So, we continue to be excited about the acquisition of Protective and will continue. And I\u2019ve met a couple times with Mike Miller, who\u2019s running Protective. He came from the commercial line side and is now running that. So he\u2019ll be excited to have his growth plan in play. We\u2019ve been focusing in the last year, so really on integrating the company within Progressive at large.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Two related questions, I think. This is on slide 26 with a 15% participation discount. The first is I was hoping you could talk us through what underpinned the decision to raise the discount. I would\u2019ve probably naively guessed that incremental information has less marginal utility. And the second question is all of equal, if I\u2019m a bad driver and I get a surcharge, then I get a bigger participation discount, then how does that factor into I guess retention and profitability? \nTricia Griffith: Yes. I\u2019ll let Jim talk about that. I think the larger discount is what John was saying. We\u2019re pricing to the curve -- to the full curve. And so we know those customers are -- have great driving behaviors and we\u2019re going to add them. And of course, the adverse election is on the drivers that are not so good in the surcharges. Do you want anything, Jim?\nJim Haas: Sure. Yes. Raised the participation discount, in part we\u2019re going to continue as we\u2019re asking customers to do more in that case, and we wanted to encourage them. And the participation discount creates a larger incentive for that. As for how it would relate if you ultimately got a surcharge on the renewal term, the participation discount is only for the first term. So it\u2019s removed, when you get to the renewal. And so, a bad driver is now getting a larger surcharge and they\u2019re getting a larger discount removed off the first term, which would get us priced more accurately on them in the subsequent terms, which is the goal. So, the participation discount is there to encourage people to participate, and then we just price as accurately as we can on the subsequent terms.\nMeyer Shields: Second question, I\u2019m thinking of California, but there may be other regions where rating flexibility is limited. It seems like the economic benefits are of UBI monitoring are enormous. Is there a chance of getting this incorporated into the rating algorithms for more risky states?\nTricia Griffith: We\u2019d love to be in California. That\u2019s kind of a history from a lot of the proposition 103, things that came up many, many decades ago. We want to grow in California. We talked about that a lot. It\u2019s the most populous state. But in the meantime, we will continue to work with the department to get the rates that we need to make sure that we reach our target profit margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Paul, go ahead with your question.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about if the telematics, particularly the continuous use of telematics are allowing you to effectively change prices faster if the environment changes without having to actually file a rate change. It sounds like that\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t know enough about how the formulas work for telematics products to know if you can effectively react to environmental changes through the telematics product without actually changing the filing?\nTricia Griffith: Good question, Paul. I\u2019ll let Jim take that.\nJim Haas: Paul, you\u2019re right. The customer is continuously monitoring and they\u2019re driving changes dramatically, like because of a pandemic or something like that, the telematics rating on the renewal would pick that up over time. In terms of the effect of that, you have to just -- we just started to roll out continuous last year. For the first six months, it looks just like it did before, it\u2019s not until the renewal that it changes, a lot of the states we elevated were towards the back half of the year. So they\u2019re just coming up on their first renewal, so. And then you need to build up a bigger -- that will grow over time to be a bigger share of the in-force book. But right now, it\u2019s still early days of that. So it will be a little while before that\u2019s like a really effective mechanism for that. Plus, we would need to get the rate on all the people who aren\u2019t in UBI, we would do that through traditional means.\nPaul Newsome: Can you talk about how quickly you can change the algorithm as well? Is that something that means that something can go into a filing or we effectively just change the algorithm for both the continuous and the non-continuous, if you see an environmental change of some type?\nJim Haas: Typically, that\u2019s sort of filing. We file the algorithm of the states confidentially and that\u2019s typically how that would be done.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thank you. That was my questions. These are wonderful calls. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.\nGregory Peters: Most of my telematics questions have been answered. Tricia, in one of your comments you talked about media spend. I know you guys go through an annual budget. Can you talk to us about your perspective on your advertising media budget for 2023 versus 2022?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So, I mean, we absolutely do a budget, but then ongoing, we assess it based on the efficiency of the spend. We look at our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale and then -- and kind of where we\u2019re getting the business from. So I talked a little bit about ambient shopping, which, of course, is really efficient. We\u2019re in a little bit more of that position now. But, what we will do is as the year progresses, we will continually assess what we need to do to spend more if we believe it\u2019s efficient or pull back if we believe we\u2019re butting up against our 96 ceiling. And those are conversations that happen continuously. Some things we -- to get sort of advanced discounts we pay for upfront. So those are kind of -- those spend. But we have a lot of flexibility, especially on the digital side to bolt back should we need to, like you saw in the last year. So, we have a budget, it\u2019s fluid. And over the years, it can go up or down depending on what we believe is in the best interest of profitably growing the Company.\nGregory Peters: Does that answer mean that the budget is higher for \u201823 versus \u201822? I\u2019m not sure what it means.\nTricia Griffith: At this point in time, it could be higher. I mean things changed. So, it was higher last year. If you would have asked me this last January, I said it would be higher than the year before, but it didn\u2019t end up being that because we had to make some flexibility. So, we budget for what we think can happen with a lot of flexibility.\nJohn Sauerland : A couple of adds there. So it\u2019s -- I would characterize it as dynamic and opportunistic. So, to the extent we feel we\u2019re adequately priced, we\u2019re going to spend a lot more on advertising. Again, with as Tricia said, an eye towards our targeted acquisition cost that we priced into the product and our lifetime economics on those policies. But, if you look at our expense ratio, especially our direct expense ratio for January, as an example, you can see it was up. So, clearly, through the latter part of last year as we were working hard to ensure we hit our 96 combined ratio for the year, you saw that expense ratio drop which was driven to a large degree by lower advertising costs. In January, you saw that pop back up, which is a great indicator that we\u2019re spending more on advertising right now.\nGregory Peters: Okay. My second question was on reinsurance. Now, the market\u2019s hard that you\u2019ve had. Obviously, reinsurance is an important part of your story last year. Can you talk to us about your perspective on reinsurance and how it might change this year versus last year?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, absolutely. We have Brandon [ph] here who runs our reinsurance organization. So, I\u2019ll have him weigh in.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks for the question on reinsurance. I mean, I think we -- particularly with how we adapted to the placement at 1/1, we\u2019ll carry that forward to how we look to our June placement, which is really the core part of our program. We tend to be fairly conservative in how we want to retain property cat losses. I think we\u2019ll continue that. We\u2019ll have to be flexible in what the market is willing to offer as far as how we can tailor that to what we decide to purchase. \nGregory Peters: Does that mean you\u2019re going to have a higher deductible or a lower deductible?\nUnidentified Company Representative: It\u2019s a little early to say exactly where we\u2019re going to land on that. Certainly, the bottom end of reinsurance programs have seen a lot of pressure, not just this year but over the last couple of years. We will be looking at other creative options if need be to manage our retention.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: I did have a question on telematics, specifically the OEM data and vehicles. Just curious if you have any data on the capabilities of the existing vehicles on the road in the U.S. It just -- it seems like that might be limited to more newer vehicles with cellular data connections, which I get the sense might be -- at least currently might be a fairly small chunk of the vehicle population in the U.S., just given turnover. So, just wondering if you can elaborate on that at all.\nJim Haas: Yes, you\u2019re correct. The firm we\u2019re talking about depends upon vehicles with the cellular connection as we\u2019re referring to OEMs over the last several years have been investing in that. They\u2019re in really different places depending on the OEM. Some are -- have had been there for a number of years, some are still working on it. So, it\u2019s -- and it does take a while for the fleet to turn over. So, it\u2019s very focused on a few OEMs and the most recent model years. But as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got relationships with GM and Toyota, which are two of the larger ones. They\u2019ve got more of an installed base. And we expect other -- almost every OEM is moving in this direction. So we expect that this population will grow over time.\nMichael Ward: And then maybe could you discuss kind of the take-up between OEM data versus using the mobile phone app route? It just seems like there\u2019s more hurdles involved in the mobile app, and that maybe that\u2019s why take-up wasn\u2019t great initially. And so sort of curious about how you see those 2 trending?\nJim Haas: Adoption in the whole program overall has been up, and we\u2019re happy with the adoption of both mobile and OEM. So we\u2019re happy with both of those programs. We just offer different options to consumers depending on how they want to share that data. And so we\u2019re just trying to get the biggest footprint we can and both have been increasing.\nMichael Ward: Okay. So maybe just to elaborate on that. I think you guys mentioned that the take-up or the adoption wasn\u2019t great for existing customers. And so, I\u2019m just curious what -- why might it be great for new customers than -- is part of it, just the competitors raising rates currently or the shopping is up?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I would just say it\u2019s one of the things that new business when you\u2019re asking for a bunch of data to kind of assess the rate to risk. When I talked about the current customers, we were doing that in 2020 because we knew people were struggling with their finances. Everything was going up from groceries to et cetera. So we did sort of a marketing campaign and just most people didn\u2019t do it. I think you get sort of -- just like anything, whether it\u2019s life insurance or health insurance you sort of make that decision and then you stick with it. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t necessarily want to do again. So, it\u2019s just easier to do a new business when we\u2019re acquiring all the information we need for an accurate rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous.\nRyan Tunis: I had a couple on just the UBI stuff. So, the first one, just thinking about the collision detection. I\u2019m curious if maybe that could potentially have some kind of impact on frequency because I would think that there\u2019d be a lot of customers with kind of smaller dollar claims that wouldn\u2019t want to tell their insurance company, they got in the crash and just to keep their -- the rates where they are. So is there any possibility that you knowing that they got in the crash that potentially lead to you actually getting more claims in the door?\nJim Haas: Yes. Thank you, Ryan. It\u2019s a good question. In this particular case, the way the crash detection algorithm works, it\u2019s looking really for more severe accidents. It\u2019s not trying to pick up fender benders. So, these are claims that we fully expect would have gotten reported either way. These aren\u2019t small dollar claims, where somebody might just choose either not to repair or to handle it out of pocket. These are larger claims. So, we don\u2019t think of it. We think we\u2019ve gotten these claims anyway.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I guess just thinking about some of the telematics. So one question I had was for the drivers that you find giving really big discounts to be like 40%, what -- if you look at like kind of the traditional insurance rating variables you used that are not in telematics space, I don\u2019t know, ZIP code, FICO, whatever, can you draw any conclusions about like when you\u2019re giving really big discounts to customers, which of the variables tend to have been kind of the shakiest predictive indicators? That\u2019s the first part. And then also I was just curious about is when you find yourself giving a surcharge for the continuous, like six months later, you gave the discount, how you\u2019re giving a surcharge, what are the main reasons that you\u2019re finding that you\u2019re having to give a surcharge after getting a discount?\nJim Haas: So, on the first part of your question in terms of how -- what are the traditional variables and what it informs, the whole point of UBI that is incremental to all of that. So, if we could have seen that these variables without UBI, we\u2019re inaccurate, we would have fixed it. UBI gives us new information about that customer that the traditional variables tend to let you segment further, not just live in the ZIP code or they have this credit score. But this person within that is different than the other person that otherwise looks the same. So, that\u2019s the point, it\u2019s improving the segmentation. In terms of the surcharge, the discount we give is a participation discount, which is just for signing up. And so, if they move from the discount surcharge, it\u2019s simply because we\u2019ve then gotten that driving data and continuous model, theoretically, people could move from one to the other. But in terms of why someone will get a surcharge, our model, as we kind of share on the website, it uses things like hard braking, how much you drive, when you drive variables like that. So folks who tend to get a surcharge drive more and drive -- have more hard brakes. This is a sign of how aggressively they\u2019re driving. Those are typically some of the variables that figure into that.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And just I guess following up, so I hear you it\u2019s incremental. But what about just in terms of conclusion, is it usually -- can you say anything about those who get 40% tend to largely be much more preferred or those who get kind of in the 40% discount tend to be more mixed or tend to be a little bit more on -- a little bit less standard?\nJim Haas: I think the UBI is kind of showing us it\u2019s incremental to all of that. So the -- intentionally, we don\u2019t want it to look that way. We want it to be -- if we knew the preferred customers were more likely to get the discount, we\u2019d just give them a bigger discount in the first place. So, we try to use UBI to kind of sort out this preferred customer deserves an even bigger discount. This other preferred customer deserves maybe a surcharge. So, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s segmenting beyond what we already have.\nDoug Constantine: We\u2019ve exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event. Stacy, I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was among the toughest years of Progressive's 85 years. The continued effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the largest hurricane in our history all played a role in a tumultuous environment. Throughout these challenges, Progressive people came together in unity and delivered once again beating our goal of a calendar year 96 combined ratio while growing both written premiums and policies in force. The pride that I feel in all of the people of Progressive is indescribable. We have met all challenges head on and continued to deliver the best-in-class results our stakeholders expect. Our ability to meet these challenges is embedded in our culture, which is built on our newly updated four cornerstones, which are who we are, which is our core values, why we are here, which is our purpose. We revised our purpose to be, we exist to help people move forward and live fully. Our modified purpose builds on the legacy of our core values and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress and equity. We modify the purpose to better unify and guide our organization. Where we are headed, which is our vision. We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there, which is the four pillars of our strategy. We've updated these two cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive, Progressive. In today's call, we'll once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we'll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation. As we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major personal auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise personal auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends. Based on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we've seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion. We've now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for personal auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our personal auto PIFs 3% in 2022 while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We're continuously evaluating our media budget, and we'll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market. The higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last three years have taught us anything, it's that the future is unpredictable. So, we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate as needed to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year \u201896 combined ratio. As I said in my annual shareholders letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices pillar, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today's presentation. Progressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance. We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer's car at a considerable expense. That first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016, we launched the Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device. Our most recent addition is continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022. In parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering of Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers of electronic-logging devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses. Throughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable, and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers. Through this, we've continuously educated our customers where today UBI adoption is at near historical highs. To highlight our UBI products on this call, we've invited two Progressive leaders who've played significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our personal auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year Progressive veteran. And for the last five years, he has led our personal auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in personal auto UBI. Following Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For nine years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in Commercial Lines, Cory led R&D during the successful rollout of both our commercial auto UBI products. Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving Progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology. Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim? Yes. Mike, I think you're thinking about it in the right way. A couple caveats. When we report frequency, we report incurred in a lot of our competitors report paid, but we've been seeing this trend more negative in the industry for a while. We can't speculate on a lot of things. Obviously, segmentation is a big piece, we believe. We also believe that mix of business could play a role and that could be mix in states or mix overall from a preferred perspective. We talked in the fourth quarter and in my letter about growth across all of our segments that we started to see increase in Q4. We have seen growth again across all segments, but higher in the Diane's Wrights and Robinsons. Again, we still see it in Sam's, but it's higher, so it could be mix as well. The good news is that we see this data change quickly. So, if we need to change anything we're doing from a pricing perspective, we'll see it pretty quickly. Yes. Sure, Mike. I'll let Jim Haas talk a little bit more about that. But we think competition across the board, whether it's with the OEs or with insure-techs is great. We also feel like when we have partnerships like Jim talked about, it's really important and it benefits most importantly the consumers. So Jim, do you want to add any color to that? Thanks, David. I will tell you I feel a lot more bullish than I felt about four or five months ago. We went through reacting to severity trends that frankly we've never seen before. I can't predict what PIF growth will be because we -- there's a lot of environmental things going on, and what I've learned over the last three years is to anticipate that there's going to be things that we haven't prepared for, whether it's the used car prices, inflation, frequency, driving behavior, pandemic. That said, I believe we're in a really great position as we sit. So, we said, we were going to start to take rate. I think, we foreshadowed that late \u201821. It took some time into 2022 to obviously start to earn into the book. We do feel good, but we're always watching what's happening and there's been kind of an ever-evolving changing. So on the private passenger auto side, as you know, we took 13.5 points last year. We still have about 3 points of that to earn in, in this calendar year. And just for some color, we took 1.5 points in January. So, we continue to look at trends, and the future -- and the future trends and the rate need -- that we need now to match rate to risk. But that said, and John Sauerland added this on to the first question from Mike and that is what --we're in such a good position now because we have -- there's a lot of shopping out there, a lot of prospects out there because our competitors have been now raising rates. So, they're catching up just and sometimes exceeding us. But we're in just a different position, because we got out in front of it. So, there's a lot of shopping, a lot of ambient shopping, which is really efficient for us. And what happens with what both Jim and Cory talked about, as well as other variables, we believe we have superior segmentation. So, we're going to grab onto as many customers and obviously keep as many customers as we can for as long as we can. However, this timeframe in this hard market lasts, and of course that segmentation and the adverse selection flywheel works in our favor because of our many, many decades of investing in things like segmentation, competitive prices, our brand, et cetera. So, while I can't foreshadow what our PIF growth is going to be, we are going to do everything we can to follow our longstanding goal of growing as fast as we possibly can at our 96 combined ratio and making sure we can take care of our customers. Yes. I mean, I think from a cost perspective, obviously continuous is a little bit more expensive, but those costs have gone down over the years. But I think, what we're excited about and what Jim talked about -- the excitement about is the services that we're going to provide especially in some of the claims examples. So, we will continue to evolve like we have since 1996 with our UBI products. And we believe that we'll continue to enhance our ability to out segment our competitors. What that means from the exact amount, we don't know yet, but we'll continue to monitor and I'm sure ever so often we'll update you on where we're at with our UBI offerings. Yes. You know, I've been thinking about that a lot because in times where we have high growth, we often talk about the new business penalty. And as I'm thinking about it, penalties from my perspective are something that is done to you because maybe you did something wrong. As an example, Sunday, I was watching our youngest son play Lacrosse. He got a penalty for slashing. He knew it. He was emotional. He did it. He took a knee. We're a little bit different because the things that we do and the amount that we pay is all controllable. As you witnessed when we pulled back on media and did some other things to make sure we reached our 96. So, from my perspective, what we are paying, so you'll -- you saw the increase in January and our expense ratio specifically on the direct side because we front load our acquisition costs there. It's really an investment in our future. It's an investment for our owners, investment for our customers. So, it's something that we're excited to do in terms of how we manage the business? And again, we have the caveats with our ceiling of an aggregate, all business lines, 96 combined ratio. So it's hard to compare from the past where we'll go. But we know that this has been a really volatile environment and we have the levers to pull back should we need to and throttle forward should we need to. So, can't tell you the exact amount. I will tell you that we're pretty excited about the position we are in right now. And again, we're Progressive. So, we're never going to be cocky and we're always going to be really paranoid and we follow the data maniacally and talk about it all the time. But we are really excited about what we believe this hard market, however long it lasts, brings. Yes. I'll talk about it high level and then Jim and Cory can weigh in for their perspective on businesses. But one, it takes a lot to get history of driving behavior and to continuously learn on that. So, I think you have to have a headstart, which is why we sort of did a primer on the history of where we've been. We were out ahead of it, obviously, nearly three decades ago. A couple points though, I think the -- and one that Jim made is, I think it's important to make sure that we are pricing rate to risk. So although customers are never happy when they get a surcharge, when they do and if they go somewhere else again, that's adverse selection. So there is multiple pieces of not just the, N equals 1, but also what can happen from a competitive perspective. So, to be able to have the UBI as well as our other segmentations to truly understand that rate to risk in what John talked about with our underwriting acumen is also an important piece. I think it's probably more important on the commercial line side from the perspective of, if I'm a good driver and I drive a truck, can I save money on my insurance, which is a big cost in the commercial line? So I don't know if Jim or Cory, you want to add anything? I'll add one last thing just because I think this is a subtle nuance, so really important. And Cory mentioned it a couple of times. When he's thinking about telematics in his role, in his prior role and Commercial Lines, he's talking to Jim and their team. He referred to his colleagues and learnings that they have. This is really common and very specific when you think about our strategic pillars. One is our people and our culture. Our culture is to go back and forth, whether it's talent and rotational jobs, but understanding learnings from the first movers within the company. That is really key, and I think it's really different because many of us -- I think Lori Niederst prior to her role when she prior to her role when she was in CHRO, she shared many years ago, the amount of depth in our leadership ranks because we think it's really important for people to know many sides of the business. So although it's subtle and it's hard to measure, the way our culture is and the way our leaders work and the sharing of ideas and successes and opportunities is really important, especially in something like telematics. Yes. I'll let Jim talk about that more. Similar platform doesn't mean we're all using the same data or the same models or using the data in the same way. So one, it's expensive to get into this. Over these last three years, we've invested a lot. So, you just can't all of a sudden turn on, understand your data early on, it's different. In urban and rural, it's different with your other segmentation variables. But Cambridge is the platform, but we're not all sharing the same data and outputting the same exact thing. Jim, do you want to add anything? Yes. I think that's just too new. We're just really dipping into this. We'll probably have more on that in 18 to 24 months. Again, it's something that we're interested in. We've always been since probably 30 years ago want to make sure that we're there for our customers and their greatest time of need. So, our -- the biggest thing that we want to do there is to help our customers get help when they need it. And if we can use the data from the impact to start the claim going and get them back into the position they were before the accident, give them that peace of mind. That's pretty important. And that could relate to a lot of great benefits in terms of retention, et cetera. But again, way too soon to be able to share much on that and we'll probably have more in a few years. From the new perspective, which is what we share externally, it's higher in direct. Jim, correct me if I'm wrong, about 15% in the agency channel. A little bit lower? Okay. A little bit lower in the agency channel, and then more in the direct. We offer it to everyone in the direct channel coming in. And obviously, we work with over 40,000 independent agents. Some feel more comfortable making that offering. Not all do it, but we've seen an increase since 2019, which makes sense. And it's a perfect fix if you believe that you drive safely and maybe you're driving less often for new business across the board as other inflationary pressures hit consumers. We will just continue to watch it. That's why I wanted to give you a little bit of insight in January taking 1.5 points. What we know is that we closely monitor a lot of these trends. And I mentioned a bunch of them. It's been such a volatile several years that we look at our internal data, UBI data, macroeconomic trends, all I can tell you is that we will be able to react quickly and that's sort of embedded in everything that we've done in the last 85 years. So, when we start to see those or see those trends and experience those trends, we'll react quickly. And that's why we feel like we're in a good position because we were able to react quickly to the severity trends that we started to see in late 2021 and why we're sitting in the position -- the enviable position we're in now, to be able to profitably grow. Yes. And we actually did. It was in, I think 2021, maybe or 2022. I'm not sure exactly when we did, but we actually sent out material to our current customers, when trends started to change to make sure that they had that offering. And we had a small group except that. But yes, we want to be able to provide that if it makes sense for each driver. But it's normally a new business. Well, we want to be competitive and we want to price to future loss trends. So, we continue to look at that and we will increase rates, should we see severity or frequency trends change, and that's why I did give that data point in January. So we will stay on top of trends and we will continue to grow. And like John said, we haven't opened up our aperture in terms of not looking at things that are important from our underwriting perspective. So we still have more leverage from that perspective. But now to -- for me, it is all about using the data and pricing accurately as quickly as possible to match each rate to risk. We know that our customers and I think most consumers with insurance want stable rates. And so we want to be able to have, if possible, even in this kind of volatile environment what we call, small bites of the apple, to not have to increase rates like we had to in 2022 to stay ahead of trends. We also have very many offerings. So, we have whether it is in our Progressive Advantage Agency for we have a stable carrier of home, unaffiliated partners we work with to have more and more of those bundles, Wrights and Robinsons, we will continue to do that. And we really seek long-term to be sort of the destination company. And so whether it's on our paper or not, we think of that in terms of our pillar of being where, when and how our customers want to shop and buy, so broad coverage. So, on the Personal Lines side, we sell other people's home, company when it doesn't necessarily say where we're going to go. On the Commercial Lines side, we also use our product as well as others for a small business, workers' comp, GL, et cetera. So, it really is about following the customer and the more we're able to offer them, even with the Progressive Advantage Agency where it's -- we work with a lot of different partners ranging from life insurance to travel insurance to jewelry insurance, the more that the customers have and the more that we've earned their trust, the longer they stay. So, retention continues to be the holy grail. We're seeing positive improvement. We'll continue to report on that as the quarters unfold, but we do know two parts of retention are really about having stable rates and having great service. No. We focus across the board. They're a little bit different in terms of control. So, an agent can decide if they want to shop it on behalf of the consumer, but they're looking at the same thing as consumers are. And that's making sure that our mutual customers have stable rates with a company with a great brand and great service. But our goal is to extend PLEs across every segment individually and in the aggregate. Yes. We don't publish new apps on a quarterly basis, but we did want to show it for year-over-year in the opening slides we had. Basically, what happened was shopping started, the hard market started. We were in a good position, and there's a lot of prospects that began shopping. And we had good coverage at great rates and we were able to convert. So, it's really sort of when we started to see things turn. We were in a good position for that from a staffing perspective on the sales side and the claims side. But yes, that's really kind of when we saw the hard market churn. John, you want to add anything? Thanks. Not substantially. Yes. I mean, we're still learning a lot and the integration's going really well, and it was really something that was additive to what we were growing from our small fleet. So, we continue to be excited about the acquisition of Protective and will continue. And I've met a couple times with Mike Miller, who's running Protective. He came from the commercial line side and is now running that. So he'll be excited to have his growth plan in play. We've been focusing in the last year, so really on integrating the company within Progressive at large. Yes. I'll let Jim talk about that. I think the larger discount is what John was saying. We're pricing to the curve -- to the full curve. And so we know those customers are -- have great driving behaviors and we're going to add them. And of course, the adverse election is on the drivers that are not so good in the surcharges. Do you want anything, Jim? We'd love to be in California. That's kind of a history from a lot of the proposition 103, things that came up many, many decades ago. We want to grow in California. We talked about that a lot. It's the most populous state. But in the meantime, we will continue to work with the department to get the rates that we need to make sure that we reach our target profit margins. Good question, Paul. I'll let Jim take that. Yes. So, I mean, we absolutely do a budget, but then ongoing, we assess it based on the efficiency of the spend. We look at our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale and then -- and kind of where we're getting the business from. So I talked a little bit about ambient shopping, which, of course, is really efficient. We're in a little bit more of that position now. But, what we will do is as the year progresses, we will continually assess what we need to do to spend more if we believe it's efficient or pull back if we believe we're butting up against our 96 ceiling. And those are conversations that happen continuously. Some things we -- to get sort of advanced discounts we pay for upfront. So those are kind of -- those spend. But we have a lot of flexibility, especially on the digital side to bolt back should we need to, like you saw in the last year. So, we have a budget, it's fluid. And over the years, it can go up or down depending on what we believe is in the best interest of profitably growing the Company. At this point in time, it could be higher. I mean things changed. So, it was higher last year. If you would have asked me this last January, I said it would be higher than the year before, but it didn't end up being that because we had to make some flexibility. So, we budget for what we think can happen with a lot of flexibility. Yes, absolutely. We have Brandon [ph] here who runs our reinsurance organization. So, I'll have him weigh in. Yes. I would just say it's one of the things that new business when you're asking for a bunch of data to kind of assess the rate to risk. When I talked about the current customers, we were doing that in 2020 because we knew people were struggling with their finances. Everything was going up from groceries to et cetera. So we did sort of a marketing campaign and just most people didn't do it. I think you get sort of -- just like anything, whether it's life insurance or health insurance you sort of make that decision and then you stick with it. It's something you don't necessarily want to do again. So, it's just easier to do a new business when we're acquiring all the information we need for an accurate rate."

            "name": "Jim Haas",
            "content": "Thank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive's Personal Lines Telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to tell you about how we've built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed starting with how we've continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we'll be bringing to market soon. First, let's recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I'll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote. If the customer elects to sign up, we'll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term. During the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD-II device that we send them or via an app on the smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in a device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive. We'll let them know how they're doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we'll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms. At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they'll be done monitoring. I'd mention that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that's not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer's rate couldn't get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn't go up, no matter how risky they're driving look. Many companies still employ a model like this today. Of course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It's about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So, the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease. While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. And we all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance. So, starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about a fifth of customers received a surcharge, a share that we've kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but started us on the path to greater accuracy. It's also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states. Over time, we've moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us, first, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%, and finally, to where we are today. We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past too, now up to 40%. We've come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it's important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about a fifth receive a surcharge. Not surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average, while they're about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren't receiving a discount. So, the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones. And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, were more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn't know about material changes in an individual's driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time. We had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So, we decided to move forward with a partial model. Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn't all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive. The difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor, and we'll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program. Having more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively. We've increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We're one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over a quarter of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023. So, while we've been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what's happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our personal auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it's up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019. So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before. So, that's the update on what's been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via traditional rating variables on renewal policy terms. Now, I want to talk about how we're working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it's most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us will have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive. We currently have two initiatives in market. The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them. Let me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don't receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who's likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual's quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately. Our second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They've been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they'll sign up to share that data with them. And we've been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we'd ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote. Because of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we're well positioned to execute and benefit from this. To be clear, automakers are in various often early stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly line have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over. So, this isn't common yet, but we're excited about the opportunity it represents. We're already working with two of the largest double makers, General Motors and Toyota, and it's clear that this population will grow over the coming years. Lastly, I'd like to share some exciting news that doesn't involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims. We've been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently. Still, we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don't want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we'd be leaving out a lot of others. So, in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We'll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened. We'll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help. If we don't hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we'll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer's location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them. We know there are other accident response services available. We think what we're offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer's relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive. Additionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we'll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they're in Snapshot or not. Third, we're deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don't want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don't. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So, we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help. We only send help if the customer has requested or if we haven't been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don't actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We're able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need. We understand that those are even more urgent than a typical roadside request. We can also help customers notify their family members. Lastly, after an accident, one of consumers' top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we're the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data able, we're able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle it more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or two is dispatched, we'll actually get that claim started on their behalf. Let me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle for a striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right. Fortunately, no other vehicles were involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insurance vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss. Additionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn't response to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident that agent dispatched an ambulance and a tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system. We've surveyed some of our accident response customers where we've gotten has some great feedback. For instance, this customer showed that they were \u201cunable to call for help at the time but help called me.\u201d This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It's not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though. Here is another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and had the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case though, is that this customer had this accident just two days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered. Unfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it. This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arranged for the tow truck to pick up the car, and we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road. So, it's not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They've told us they value accident response, and we're excited to make it available to them. We'll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our personal auto customers over the next year or so. To wrap up, we're not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We're clear-eyed about the challenges, but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just the Personal Lines side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets, and Cory Fischer, who's led Commercial Lines R&D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory? Sure. Mike, you are right. We obviously pay for the data eventually goes to the automakers, is a way for them to monetize that. They are putting all those hardware in the car that costs money. This is a way for them to get some return on that. Some OEMs are going to want to get an insurance, as we've seen, some might not. And so this is a different way for them to get value-add out of that data from us. Personal Lines side, yes, there is certainly more activity in UBI than there was 10 years ago, let's say. We are just continuing to move our pricing forward, price more aggressively, take more advantage of that regardless of what anybody else is doing. We want to price as accurately as we can, and get as many people into that program as we can. Sure. You're right. Cambridge Mobile is our partner. We've had a great relationship with them. They provide the data collection mechanism that gets embedded in the app. And so, we do get that data from them. And you're right, most people use them in the industry. I think, what's different is we own our own algorithm. We use that data the way we want to, and we've learned a lot over the years about how to make the most out of that data. And I think you mentioned like everybody can see that. That's not actually true. Most -- in the entire industry, most algorithms for UBI are filed confidentially in the states. So, those are not shared with all of the competitors. So, we can't see other companies' algorithms, they can't see ours. So, we think we can -- we've developed an advantage there, and we can maintain that. We also have an OBD device which we offer some of our customers pick, which gives us another source of data, which we think helps calibrate some of that as well. So when they opt into the program, it is -- there is only continuous. You don't get to pick at that. Obviously, we can't force them to continue to monitor forever. So, we've got sort of -- the program is designed around that and accommodates when people stop giving us data, if they do, but we certainly encourage them to continue to grow that data. The biggest discounts are available that way and the program's design that we'd be monitoring continuously. Sure. Yes. Raised the participation discount, in part we're going to continue as we're asking customers to do more in that case, and we wanted to encourage them. And the participation discount creates a larger incentive for that. As for how it would relate if you ultimately got a surcharge on the renewal term, the participation discount is only for the first term. So it's removed, when you get to the renewal. And so, a bad driver is now getting a larger surcharge and they're getting a larger discount removed off the first term, which would get us priced more accurately on them in the subsequent terms, which is the goal. So, the participation discount is there to encourage people to participate, and then we just price as accurately as we can on the subsequent terms. Paul, you're right. The customer is continuously monitoring and they're driving changes dramatically, like because of a pandemic or something like that, the telematics rating on the renewal would pick that up over time. In terms of the effect of that, you have to just -- we just started to roll out continuous last year. For the first six months, it looks just like it did before, it's not until the renewal that it changes, a lot of the states we elevated were towards the back half of the year. So they're just coming up on their first renewal, so. And then you need to build up a bigger -- that will grow over time to be a bigger share of the in-force book. But right now, it's still early days of that. So it will be a little while before that's like a really effective mechanism for that. Plus, we would need to get the rate on all the people who aren't in UBI, we would do that through traditional means. Typically, that's sort of filing. We file the algorithm of the states confidentially and that's typically how that would be done. Yes, you're correct. The firm we're talking about depends upon vehicles with the cellular connection as we're referring to OEMs over the last several years have been investing in that. They're in really different places depending on the OEM. Some are -- have had been there for a number of years, some are still working on it. So, it's -- and it does take a while for the fleet to turn over. So, it's very focused on a few OEMs and the most recent model years. But as we mentioned, we've got relationships with GM and Toyota, which are two of the larger ones. They've got more of an installed base. And we expect other -- almost every OEM is moving in this direction. So we expect that this population will grow over time. Adoption in the whole program overall has been up, and we're happy with the adoption of both mobile and OEM. So we're happy with both of those programs. We just offer different options to consumers depending on how they want to share that data. And so we're just trying to get the biggest footprint we can and both have been increasing. Yes. Thank you, Ryan. It's a good question. In this particular case, the way the crash detection algorithm works, it's looking really for more severe accidents. It's not trying to pick up fender benders. So, these are claims that we fully expect would have gotten reported either way. These aren't small dollar claims, where somebody might just choose either not to repair or to handle it out of pocket. These are larger claims. So, we don't think of it. We think we've gotten these claims anyway. So, on the first part of your question in terms of how -- what are the traditional variables and what it informs, the whole point of UBI that is incremental to all of that. So, if we could have seen that these variables without UBI, we're inaccurate, we would have fixed it. UBI gives us new information about that customer that the traditional variables tend to let you segment further, not just live in the ZIP code or they have this credit score. But this person within that is different than the other person that otherwise looks the same. So, that's the point, it's improving the segmentation. In terms of the surcharge, the discount we give is a participation discount, which is just for signing up. And so, if they move from the discount surcharge, it's simply because we've then gotten that driving data and continuous model, theoretically, people could move from one to the other. But in terms of why someone will get a surcharge, our model, as we kind of share on the website, it uses things like hard braking, how much you drive, when you drive variables like that. So folks who tend to get a surcharge drive more and drive -- have more hard brakes. This is a sign of how aggressively they're driving. Those are typically some of the variables that figure into that. I think the UBI is kind of showing us it's incremental to all of that. So the -- intentionally, we don't want it to look that way. We want it to be -- if we knew the preferred customers were more likely to get the discount, we'd just give them a bigger discount in the first place. So, we try to use UBI to kind of sort out this preferred customer deserves an even bigger discount. This other preferred customer deserves maybe a surcharge. So, it's really -- it's segmenting beyond what we already have."

            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "I'd add a couple items on that. So I think Jim Haas' slide where he showed the retention of customers who are getting a surcharge versus a discount is a great case in point of segmentation at work. So the folks who are getting a surcharge, all else equal, are going to be the higher frequency drivers and the folks who are getting a discount are the lower frequency. And obviously in the marketplace, as that continues to play out, that will help drive our frequency more favorable than our competitors. Additionally, we've talked about underwriting efforts we put in place as we were challenged by profitability. We've raised rates considerably as we've shared. I will note though that we have retained our underwriting restrictions fairly tight. So, we've been able to manage that in this very competitive environment to a point where we are able to maintain the underwriting restrictions, which generally speaking are pushing off the higher frequency customers and able to raise rates at the same time. So, I think we are in a pretty good place, both from the rate level perspective but also continuing to guard against segments that might be underpriced. I'll just add. So, over the history of the personal auto, evolution in telematics, early on, we weren't pricing to the full curve. So, we understood that a lot of people should be receiving surcharges, and some people should be receiving bigger discounts. Because we were at the forefront and we are seeking consumer adoption, we didn't price to that full curve. I think we are now very close to or almost completely pricing to that curve with the data we have today. However, as Jim was sharing, we can continue to advance the science, continue to pull additional data elements that can continue to have us leading the pack. So, our segmentation game is never ending. We are always trying to continue to advance, to find additional data to use that can keep us with a gap between us and the competition. And as Cory mentioned in the prepared comments with the slides, Commercial Lines is at an earlier stage similar to where Personal Lines was. We still have a significant loss ratio benefit in aggregate for telematics and Commercial Lines, which means, we have further pricing options that we can play as competitors come to market with their offering. So, I think we are in a great place from a telematics standpoint. We are not at all at the end of the journey. We are going to continue to evolve and continue to advance our competitive advantage, when it comes to pricing and telematics. I'd just add that. So in the direct channel, the take rate is substantially higher than in the agency channel. It also offers that in the commercial space the demand through the agency channel is very robust. So, we're talking about, especially with Smart Haul, which is generally larger trucks that have higher average insurance costs, the benefit of enrolling in a program like this is substantial. So, agents and consumers or business owners in this case are way more likely to select that as an option and as Cory said is highly predictive in that channel as well. Yes. That was when we saw COVID driving down materially and made an offer to our existing customers to save through Snapshot and not many took us up on that offer. So it's open and available. Customers can do it. They just haven't taken us up on it significantly. As Tricia was saying, Tracy, we're continuing to broaden the offerings to our consumers. So, you talked about multi-product households as Tricia was implying those households stay with us a lot longer than single-product households and much longer than our historical core customer of Sam, who we call the inconsistently insured customer. So, our book does continue to shift more towards the Robinson end of the spectrum which is actually the longer retaining end of the spectrum. We have, as Tricia also noted, seen a setback as we've had to raise rates aggressively. That is coming back. Our PLEs are starting to trend positively at least on the trailing 3 metric. And the trailing 12 is not yet fully turned, but certainly the trailing 3 is the leading indicator of the trailing 12. So, we are definitely focusing on more multi-product households as we roll out new products in the personal auto space. Increasingly, we find segmentation that can make us more competitive for those preferred customers. Our book continues to shift that way. And as we get to a more stable rating environment, I think you'll see our PLEs continue to grow as they have been before we had to take a lot of rate. Sure. Josh, we do provide you year to date numbers through the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So, if you just assume an equal weighting, you can come to a number, but we also in the presentation showed you actual charts of those. So, you can't see exactly what the number is, but you come pretty darn close by looking at those charts. So, the short story is conversion was up considerably in the fourth quarter. Prospects were up considerably in the fourth quarter, and obviously new apps as a consequence were up a lot. Can you repeat the question, please? A couple of adds there. So it's -- I would characterize it as dynamic and opportunistic. So, to the extent we feel we're adequately priced, we're going to spend a lot more on advertising. Again, with as Tricia said, an eye towards our targeted acquisition cost that we priced into the product and our lifetime economics on those policies. But, if you look at our expense ratio, especially our direct expense ratio for January, as an example, you can see it was up. So, clearly, through the latter part of last year as we were working hard to ensure we hit our 96 combined ratio for the year, you saw that expense ratio drop which was driven to a large degree by lower advertising costs. In January, you saw that pop back up, which is a great indicator that we're spending more on advertising right now."

            "name": "Cory Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I'm Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines Product Research and Development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to share the progress we've made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we're thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It's why we're excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I've worked with is charged with advancing our commercial auto segmentation leadership position in the market. Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot. To build on that segmentation leadership position we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have two branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are acquired to maintain hours-of-service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate, requiring these truckers to move from paper log books to electronic logging devices. We have recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our Snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer's consent, we use the data from the trucker's electronic login device to generate a score and apply a rating factor. Ideally, we access the data during the quote process, just like the process Jim discussed, using data to price new business. If we are not able to get the data, either there are newer venture without driving history, or we don't have immediate access to their ELD vendor, we provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView on the right is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn't have an electronic logging device. We market Snapshot ProView as safety and savings. For customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring. We will then use their driving data to generate a score and a factor that's applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge. In addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they are being driven. It's a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we have deployed these programs, we have been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate, that is, percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program. We've seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we have identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we are genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it's on. In addition to adoption, we have seen that when quotas enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that's eligible, but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint even after the discount is applied. That's not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments at target. Between our significant footprint in the commercial auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we've built a substantial commercial auto telematics book of business. That book would be a Top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own. In summary, we are really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we have learned a lot since introducing these programs. One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It's not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments. For example, we are asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training. With telematics, we are now dealing with hardware and data transmission. We are also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently dealing with global supply chain issues. That's a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we've had to work through. I think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It's imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that is handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes, and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets. Telematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren't nearly as effective, transforming big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that personal auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20 some years, has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage. For example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the personal auto Snapshot device. Given the volume that personal auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions.  In terms of big data, personal auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They've also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools. To summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim's group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from. It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment. I'll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there's a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data sharing consent or installing the plug-in device. We have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that aren't currently eligible for one of these programs. We're looking to expand eligibility. One example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near term plans, we'll continue to grow our telematics book, and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models. We're also excited about new data sources and applications. We're seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dash cams. We've been doing a pilot with dash cams for over a year. There's data from video that we don't capture today, like following distance, which could be valuable, and as Jim shared, we're interested in how telematics can help with the claims process. Dash cams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims. We're also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging Zip code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct. We can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote. Here's an example. This shows one truck's driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insured's address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey and they've listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers at garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out, there's a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It's hard to tell from this map, but from the data, let's say 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around. A territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model. I don't see a time we have a telematics only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution. Wrapping up, we've got a great start to our telematics journey. We've got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made. And I'm really excited about how we'll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So for commercial auto, we are the largest commercial auto insurer and we are also number one in truck. And I think with that, we have a lot more data than anyone else. And so, we have, we feel like a leadership position in segmentation. I think telematics extends that leadership position relative to the marketplace. So, there are some companies that are investing in telematics. But I think between our size, the amount of data we have, we believe we are increasing the lead through telematics."

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Acting as moderator for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, Austin, and good morning. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions maybe be found at investors.progressive.com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second and third quarter of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. When our customers interact with us they're often doing so on their worst day, maybe their vehicle was just stolen, maybe they were injured in a car accident or their property damage was analyzed. This fact comes into even sharper focus during a major catastrophe such as Hurricane Ian. While watching the footage of devastation, my heart went out to all those who were affected by the storm. For millions it was truly their worst day. And I'm proud of the part Progressive plays to help people recover from such a calamitous event. Within hours after the storm, Progressive had over 1,500 people ready to help our customers start to rebuild their lives. And while we cannot always replace what was lost, our people are in place to make it as easy as possible for our customers to return to normalcy. Thank you to all the Progressive customers who trust us to make their worst day more manageable. In my letter, I shared some of the Herculean efforts that our employees were making on behalf of our customers and there are many more where that came from. Needless to say, I'm very proud of so many. While, Hurricane Ian was the largest single event in the third quarter, it was not the whole story. Excluding catastrophe losses, our third quarter company-wide combined ratio improved 1.9 points year-over-year and illustrates the significant work we've done to combat the effects of inflation and working towards achieving our goal of an underwriting margin of at least 4%, specifically in personal auto. As we stated after the first quarter, with the exception of a few markets, our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us, so we continue to be vigilant and adjust rates as our loss experience develops. In the third quarter, we increased personal auto rates in 20 states at average of about 5% per state for a total countrywide premium impact of plus 2%. The third quarter rate action brings our countrywide year-to-date rate increases to nearly 12%. We continue to closely monitor frequency and severity trends to ensure we stay true to our stated goal of profit before growth. So we have continued to take rate. We believe we took rate earlier than the industry, which initially negatively impacted volume, but more recently has created opportunities for growth. Consumer shopping and quoting has increased more than 20% in both the agency and direct channels. In fact in both channels we had the best July, August and September in our company's history for quote volume. This prospect growth is despite a lower acquisition expense ratio as compared to 2021, allowing us to be a beneficiary, as competitors have pulled back on marketing spend. This combination of lower competitor spend and our continued advancement of the science of media planning and buying, led to an incredible increase in efficiency in our media spend and has helped propel this quarter's growth. Auto quote growth coupled with continued improvement in conversion, as our competitors raised rates, led to auto new application growth of 20% in the quarter including the highest August and highest September combined to channel new application volume that we've seen in the company's history. Total personal auto year-over-year PIF growth is still negative, but we've now seen several months of sequential monthly PIF growth led by the growth in the direct channel and flattening in the agency channel. The sequential growth has been bolstered not only by new application growth but signs of improving retention. In last quarter's call, we spent considerable time talking about our property business and efforts we are taking to return to profitable growth. The losses incurred from Hurricane Ian further highlight the need to shift our mix to less volatile state. As expected, PIF growth in properties slowed in the quarter, as we make progress in this multiyear goal. Our assets continue unabated with rate and non-rate actions, as we work towards a mix that is more reflective of the market.  Given this volatile backdrop, it's only natural that the insurance industry would be facing questions regarding capital. So we thought it would be useful to quickly summarize our strong capital position. As discussed in our annual report, we view our capital position as consisting of multiple layers. First, in our insurance operating subsidiaries, we maintain adequate surplus to support growing as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. Our extreme contingency layer includes capital in excess of regulatory capital that ensures on a model basis, a less than 100 and 200 probability that we will need to raise additional capital. We have $4.2 billion that we held at quarter end in a non-insurance subsidiary of the holding company level, which is well access of that contingency layer and is highly liquid due to mostly being comprised of short-term securities and treasuries. While we have incurred temporary losses in our investment portfolio due to the significant move in interest rates, our fixed portfolio is extremely conservative with over half of the portfolio in cash or treasuries and a portfolio duration at the end of the quarter at 2.7 years. Throughout the year, we have taken proactive measures to prepare the portfolio for various scenarios by reducing interest rate, credit and equity risk. Another proactive measure we took was to raise $1.5 billion of 5, 10- and 30-year debt in March at an average 3% interest rate. Due to the highly uncertain outlook, we felt it was prudent to have extra capital at what we viewed as very attractive borrowing rates. As we sit, we have no near-term bond maturities that we have to address in this higher interest rate environment, the combination of the borrowing along with significant interest -- increase in interest rates have been the primary drivers in moving our debt to total capital ratio over 30% at September month end to 30.2%. We expect underwriting gains changes in the value of our bond portfolio as bonds approach maturity and investment income to bring us back below 30% in time. We are currently taking no additional actions to bring the ratio below 30% and have no near-term plan or need for raising further capital. Again, thank you for joining us and now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The question comes from the line -- our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse please proceed.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on loss adjustment expenses. I know you guys had called them out in reference to your property book in September and not in reference to the auto book. I'm just trying to get a sense and there were some comments in the queue. It doesn't seem like LAE is a high component of auto losses. And the reason I ask is it does look like the underlying loss ratio did trend higher in September and that does run a little counter to some of your comments right that it seems like you're at where you need from a rating perspective in the majority of states. So I'm hoping you can just help me kind of tie that together?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, absolutely. Let me start Elyse with the LAE. So when you think about vehicles, which I would include auto and special lines, there's not much incremental LAE when a catastrophe happens. So for years and years we built up a CAT team and it's now commensurate to the size that we are. So when a CAT happens, really the incremental LAE on that part is travel costs, hotel costs, et cetera. And then during the year those people are able to do other things. So as an example in Ian right now they're in Florida working those files. But then as that slows down, if there aren't other weather related events or catastrophes, they might go work in the salvage department to work through that salvage. So it's not hugely incremental. We called it out on the property side, because that is a little bit more incremental on that $25 million of the $200 million of the reinsurance. And that was because we do use some independent appraiser\u2019s adjusters to help with the property claim. So that's the reason why we called it out. And that will evolve. We wanted to assess a certain point for LAE and a certain point for loss, and that will evolve as the storm developed. In terms of where we're at, I do feel very comfortable. Like I said in most markets there are a few that we don't have the rate we need. And we're going to continue to take smaller bites of the apple, which is what we prefer to do and that's why I wanted to outline that in my letter and opening comments. But here's how I would think about where we're at from the perspective of adequate rates. And this is a very high level. So you\u2019d have to think about this in terms of new versus renewal, channel, et cetera. So our frequency is down 9%, our severity is up 13% in aggregate. So think about a 4% net loss ratio. Our average written premium is up 8%. So you want to think of that maybe about 6.5 points to earn in. So when I think about that I feel good about where we're at again. We're watching inflation very closely. But we do feel, I'm confident that in most venues we have the rate we need to grow and we'll try to propel that growth where we can and slow where we don't believe our rates are adequate. Does that help?\nElyse Greenspan: Yeah. But as a follow-up to that was there something in September just because the underlying loss ratio did look like not that it only trended up from August, but it trended up from last September. So was there something just related to losses running hot in September relative to last year?\nTricia Griffith: Nothing in particular and this is the curse of releasing monthly earnings. I wouldn't look into one month and put much into that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then my second question as we think about getting to the end of the year and I know you guys mentioned this in your Q as well, we hear about used car prices coming down and I know that was what started to lead to the elevated severity last year. Have you guys ever broken out what component of your loss costs are driven off of used car prices, or can you just help us think through that, and the benefit that you guys could see as those values come down?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we look at the components. But what I would say is, although the wholesale prices are trending down, they're still at all-time high. So we will continue to watch that. And I think especially, we will watch it based on the fact that there are a lot of total losses that have happened in Florida with Hurricane Ian, so that could even increase demand. So, we try to break out as much as we can. When we look at severity, we look more at overall loss cost in terms of size of vehicles, labor rates, parts prices, rental price, et cetera. So, there's a lot of components that go into that. But, we're going to wait and see and continue to watch the Manheim Index and watch what happens after Ian and if we -- and we'll see that in our severity trends.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question is with Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Tricia, I wonder if you could peel back some of the layers on the frequency still favorable, in fact looks against even more so than prior quarters. I guess, can you talk about what you're seeing in your book for maybe work-from-home trends and sustainability of that? And kind of what you're baking into current pricing for how much you're baking on that to continue in your current price levels? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Sure Michael. So, in quarter three with our snapshot data, we saw vehicle miles traveled down about 11%. Previously, it was down about 14%. What we're seeing is commute miles have stayed flat. And during the quarter, we saw that traveled miles. So think of those defined as queuing from your home, 100 miles queuing from your home. So we think that might have been based on some lower gas prices, people were doing some last-minute travel because of those prices in their cars in -- during before Labor Day visiting grandma or whatever, and that usually involves less losses. So, come it's more congestion, you're going to have more losses. So we think about it that way. I don't think we'll know where frequency sort of trend long-term, until probably a quarter or two, because I know a lot of companies said, they were returning to work after Labor Day. So you're thinking in September. So what we'd like to do is, wait at least a couple of quarters to see if that sort of bottomed out and look at that pre-pandemic to 2019. And then we'll feel I think a little bit more confident, because I know a lot of companies have gone back and forth on how often their employees need to work. And I think a lot of it will depend too on COVID and flu, et cetera. So we're going to wait a few quarters, but that's what we're seeing right now on our UBI data.\nJohn Sauerland: Okay and one clarification to that. So Tricia mentioned frequency or vehicle miles traveled was down 11% that was referencing the pre-pandemic period. So when we think about vehicle mile travel, we continue to measure it relative to pre-COVID and interestingly, frequency is down a bit more than vehicle miles traveled and that's continued for quite some time has not yet come back. And we believe to Tricia's comments that, that is due to some degree to the mix of miles traveled.\nMichael Phillips: Yes. Perfect. Okay. Thanks for that. I guess, can you talk about -- used car prices coming down and how that impacts, I guess the mix of your strategy of kind of either fixing cars versus salvaging cars and how that -- I don't know if you talked about the impact of that last year when there was just a reverse of that when our prices were so high. So any impact of -- what's the impact of that on the loss ratio last year of changing the strategy because of how high prices were and how that might change as we go forward from here?\nTricia Griffith : Well, I don't know that we changed the strategy. It just happened to be that cars were more expensive, so it took more to total them. And then we did total them part -- components were more expenses. So we'll always look at the actual cash value of the vehicle and then the cost repair, which could take into account rental, et cetera. So that's how we always look at it. And then you overlay the actual cost of the cars whether new or used when you make those assessments. \nJohn Sauerland: Just a little more clarification on that sense since Lisa had a similar question. When we think about the increase in severity for physical damage coverages, so property damage collision, et cetera walking around numbers about half of that increase is from the increase in used car values. That is both when we total a car but as Tricia was mentioning you total fewer cars, because the car is worth more. So you're going to -- your estimates on repairs are going to go up as a result of used car prices as well. So it's a little tough to tease out but sort of walking around is probably half of the severity increases we've seen physical damage coverages are due to the increase in values. \nTricia Griffith : Great point.\nMichael Phillips : All right. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith : Thanks, Michael. \nOperator: Our next question is with Mike Zaremski from BMO. Mike, your line is open.\nMike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning. Sticking to the auto severity side of the equation, lots of good color, thank you so far. Maybe curious if you could offer any color and whether there's any trends you're seeing on the bodily and reside or maybe just severity ex kind of used car prices more broadly? \nTricia Griffith : So on the bodily injury side, Mike? \nMike Zaremski : Correct. \nTricia Griffith : Yes. We've actually seen the bodily injury has been fairly stable in the kind of 6% to 8% range. And of course it went up after the pandemic that was based on more attorney representation, more soft tissue attorney representation not necessarily litigation and then just the overall social inflation. But we're seeing that level out in the 6% to 8% range. \nMike Zaremski : And that's kind of considered kind of a more normal range when you think about versus pre-pandemic levels, there's kind of no secular trend or something that we should be thinking about moving around there materially?\nTricia Griffith : Yes. I mean, it's hard to say because during the pandemic, there was little or none and then I think it went up pretty significantly. So yes, I think that would be accurate to say in that range of pre-pandemic.\nMike Zaremski : Okay. I guess, just going back to frequency again just curious you guys are now able to give us some great stats on vehicle miles traveled and what you're seeing commuter versus maybe non-commuter trips? And kind of just curious does the data you have today does it allow you to -- Progressive to be any more agile, or do you guys do things definitely when setting rates today versus maybe when you think back to the 2016, 2017 frequency spike cycle that you feel you can take advantage or be more opportunistic, or is it still kind of -- nothing has changed much? It's very tough to figure out frequency and I'm thinking too much about this?\nTricia Griffith: No, I think you're thinking -- well, we're thinking about it all the time. The hard part is -- there's so many macroeconomic trends that affects frequency. You saw that with gas prices. And so, I think there's a lot of things that we constantly look at in our models. I think, the best thing, when we think of pricing for our customers, is to encourage them to use snapshot. And that's us a big approach for people, who want to be able to save money, especially if they are not driving. So, we've seen an uptick in the take rate and our mix of business, new business in UBI. And we think that's great because, if consumers cars are sitting in their garages, more often than not, they should get a discount as long as when they're driving that they're driving safely.\nMike Zaremski: And are those Snapshot customers, just as my final follow-up, slightly more profitable over time than the non-Snapshot customers? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. No, not necessarily.\nJohn Sauerland: We continue to price as accurately as we can with the data we have. So, as our snapshot database continues to grow and we move to a continuous monitoring model, we have an increasing data set to work with and an ongoing data set to work with, because we have continuous monitoring. And I think, in eight states now and are continuing to roll that across the country. Early on with Snapshot, we weren't pricing completely to the curve, if you will. And as consumer adoption, as Tricia noted, has gotten to be really good and growing. We've been more and more comfortable with pricing to the full curve, which is the best accurate segmentation we can get.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Question I had was just on the strategy of pivot into growth and pricing. When I think about the timing of when you all sort of looked at it and decided that, you could take maybe the foot off the accelerator on price a little bit, feeling better about your adequacy. Since that time, there's been some benefit from gas prices and frequency that may go away. And there's also, I think been increases to sort of the non-used car pieces of severity and medical costs and wage inflation sort of impacting things, is being able to stick to that and try to drive growth here. I mean, is there a risk that those things force you to change course? I mean, how should I think about that risk of sort of different severity items and getting a little worse, since you started down that road on the strategy?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We have had a long-term strategy to grow as fast as we can at/or below a 96 combined ratio. That will continue. That's something that's worked for us 85 years or at least since we went public in 1971, we first started talking about the 96. So, we will do that. We watch trends very, very diligently and take actions quickly when -- and decisively when we need to. Unfortunately, in this last year, we've had to take rate increases that we normally do to take. We don't like to take huge rate increases unlike we have. Like, we talk about smaller bites of the apple, which we believe we're now in a position to take as things change in each venue. So, our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to try to grow as fast as we can. Obviously, with the hurricane we're over 96, so we have a few months to go and we're going to continue to try to leverage this really unique opportunity to get growth while still maintaining our 96 combined ratio. In fact, in September, we had our lowest cost per sale since 2017. So, we're seeing really the advantage of the -- because our competitors aren't advertising as much and are taking rate, we're seeing some really great ambient growth. So, we're going to try to pull all the levers to do that to grow as fast as we can but we do have the 96 that we believe we always talk about profit over growth. \nAlex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And could you help us frame the potential impact from higher reinsurance costs as we think through a hard market in reinsurance? And I guess probably impacts you more on the property side. And just looking through some of the commentary on your how quickly you can non-renew and sort of do some of the pivoting that you wanted to do. It sounds like some of that's had to slow down for regulatory reasons. What does that all mean when we think through reinsurance cost potentially going up? \nTricia Griffith: I'll have Dave talk about reinsurance but I'll hit on the sort of de-risking the book. I will say that reinsurance costs we are able to pass on so that is one benefit. But clearly that market is hardening. So, we talked about our goal of de-risking the portfolio specifically moving 60,000 policies out of Florida -- homes out of Florida sort of mitigate that risk. It takes a while. So we talked about that last year. We had a 90-day notification period to our customers. So, in earnest we started non-renewing those 60,000 in May of 2022. And then there was a special legislative session and there was a Senate Bill that allowed us -- allows homeowners to renew their policy as long as they could prove through inspection that they had at least five years of useful life left on their roof, which is great because that's okay with us and at least we know the rate to risk when we know how old the roof is. So, we knew that there would be less than 60,000 policies and it would take a little bit longer. And then, of course, enter Hurricane Ian and there's been a moratorium on non-renews and cancellations from September 28th to November 28th, so we won't be able to not renew any. Until after that is lifted those executive orders are lifted. So, suffice it to say that it's going to take us a little bit longer to de-risk and we get that and we'll continue to update everyone as that happens. I will say that we are not open for new business in A3 DPI or A06, so home, dwelling fire, and condo and we will not be open for new business until the executive order is lifted. The only caveat is we have some new homes with a select group of builders brand-new homes that we will be working with them, so they can close and have insurance on their home. So, I think the punchline is it's a volatile environment but we remain focused on achieving our goal and having our portfolio of homes across the country and not based on all the risky areas. So, Dave do you want to add anything on the reinsurance \nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure Tricia. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I would just note that we have a long continuous stable trading relationships with lots of big reinsurance providers. And we try to be very transparent with them about our results, and our business plans. And so we feel confident, that we'll continue to have access to the reinsurance that we need. And we believe that we get favorable pricing based on that transparency. It does seem likely that costs will go up, next year and we will pass those through in our rate filings as quickly as we can, to make sure they're accurately reflected in our prices. Thank you.\nJohn Sauerland: I'd also add, that if you have some multiyear agreements. So our entire program is normally not up for renewal in any given year, which helps us mitigate the impact of increases and allows us to better put those increases into our primary prices. We do also use some insurance-linked securities, if you will also cap bonds. So we're trying to diversify, our reinsurance and catastrophe coverage program both for time and for the instruments we use to ensure that we are stable as possible. \nQ \u2013 Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg, your line is open. \nGreg Peters: Good morning. I guess, I'd like to pivot for the first question on the Commercial Lines results. And I know in your letter, you called out the unusual items with the TNC policies, that affected the third quarter results. And then you said, the net would have been up around 2%, excluding all the noise. And that certainly doesn't seem to be growing as fast as you can, considering your combined ratio is below 96. So [indiscernible] in the letter you mentioned, the bot policies the other -- some of the other initiatives. Can you sort of map out, how you think growth is going to emerge in that business? Because it seems like it's slowing down not speeding up. \nTricia Griffith: Yes, I can map out sort of what's happened and how we're positioned for the future. So, we had such an opportunity in our four higher trucking business markets here, when the pandemic happened. So many people, as I'm sure you did you're having lots of good ships. So obviously, you had the trucking industry grew, and it grew in different ways. So, we had -- spot rates are up. So a lot of owner-operators would leave from a carrier and go on their own to be able to make it on their own. We were there for them. We were there at the right rate, and we had a history of this customer. So, it's a really beautiful growth. So even when you look at that 2%, you've got to look at the denominator because the last couple of years have been unbelievably successful in commercial lines. So now that spot rates have gone down a little bit and softened, some of those carriers are going -- some of those owner operators are going back to carriers, we do have a couple coverages, non-trucker liability and GL where we can keep those pits, when they're not -- when they're away from doing business with the carrier that they're part of. So we think we'll continue to grow. So that's more of a retention piece. What I would say is, the opportunity that we have is because we're so diversified in commercial. So think of -- a few years ago, we only wrote 10 or fewer power units. Now we went to 40 and then of course, we purchased Protective, which could give us an opportunity to be able to ensure some of those medium to large fleets. So we feel really good about our position there. And of course, Smart we have in nearly 40 states, I think 37, and that will continue to grow. Those are things we invested in three-plus years ago, because we know that this -- the commercial lines is very cyclical and very linked to macroeconomic trends. So although, the growth is smaller on a percentage basis, we've grown tremendously in commercial lines. We have a tremendous plan laid out a 10-year plan, Karen Herd your team have laid out to continue to grow and continue to diversify to make sure that we're able to be there when a different economic shift happens.\nGreg Peters: Okay. I appreciate the detail there. I guess I'm going to pivot for my second question. In your letter you talked about evaluating underwriting restriction bill plans, media spend and this is going to be focused on the expense ratio and the personal lines business. You said in your comments that you're looking at frequency and those type of trends pre-pandemic. So if I look at your expense ratio, pre-pandemic like the 2019-point in time and compared to where it is today. Today it's a lot lower. I guess as you consider ramping up your growth plans in auto, is it conceivable that the expense ratio will start trending back up as you spend more on advertising et cetera? And should we look at the 2019 sort of the base here for where the expense ratio might go to?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, it's very conceivable. So we look at expense ratio with the regular expenses and non-acquisition expense ratios. We will spend \u2013 given the takeaway to 96 for a moment, we will spend as much as we can as long as we believe it's efficient. So while our expense ratio is lower now, like I said, we're really bullish on growth for this quarter because of what we being in the ambient shopping and just the environment based on our competitors' spending and our competitors' rates. So yes, you could see it go up if we continue to spend in advertising. I will say that we're constantly looking at our plan on both loss ratio or expense ratio and LAE to make sure we can continue to be efficient because we do want to spend more in the acquisition funnel. So yes, you could see it go up a little bit as we determine what the right spend is. And of course, we have the 96 governor so that is going into play a little bit right now.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question is with David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks, good morning. Tricia last quarter you said that you don't have local media ad spend on in 19 states. And I think that compared to 26 states as of the end of April. I was wondering if you could share where that stands today? How many states do not have local media on at this point in time? And maybe some color around how much in premium those states represent?\nTricia Griffith: I'll let Pat take that. I'm not sure of the exact number. I believe it's less than 17 though, but I'm not sure exactly. Again, we look at that just based on our ability to grow and our ability to get the right rate. So in the states where we can't get rate, obviously we'll continue to make sure that we do everything we can not to grow. Some we're just waiting for the rates to earn in and we'll start to loosen up those underwriting guidelines and the local media spend. Pat do you want to add anything? \nPat Callahan: Yes, without sharing kind of number of states because your question about percent of premium is kind of the most relevant piece. The other piece that's complex is we say local media, but there's seven different elements of local media, whether it's digital paid social, direct mail lots of things going on in that space. I think what's important is to get back to Tricia's comment about we will spend when we can afford to spend based on the calendar year targets, when the spend is efficient relative to lifetime performance on the media, and frankly when we need to spend to drive growth. And that's where it's pretty dynamic at the channel level and ultimately the split within local media where we decide to spend versus not spend. So right now we have some states, a couple of big ones on the coast where we don't yet have adequate rates on the street and we're optimizing obviously the efficiency of our expenses there given our loss ratios are high because we can't get the rate that we need under the expected losses. So what I would say is, it's dynamic and we make adjustments all the time. And as soon as we get adequate rate we are open for business. And increasingly, we are getting adequate rates in some additional states. It's just taking longer than we had expected to previously. \nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And also Tricia, it was great to get the color just on the capital position and the debt to capital. I guess, I'm wondering if you could help us think about how we should think about the variable dividend level this year? And just, sort of, as you guys think about the growth opportunity that's in front of you how you're, sort of, thinking about that? \nTricia Griffith: Yes, absolutely. So the primary -- the best use I should say of our capital is to grow the firm. And that's what we're going to try to do, especially, like we said in this unique environment. So we have this conversation every time we meet with the Board, we'll be with them again in December. And if we don't believe we can grow, of course, we give it back in either dividends or stock buybacks we -- at this juncture, I can't say whether or not we'll have a variable dividend that will ultimately be the Board's decision. I will tell you that, I want to take advantage and leverage this opportunity to grow the firm. \nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is with Gary Ransom from Dowling Partners. Gary, your line is open.\nGary Ransom: Good morning. I wanted to go revisit the frequency question. Just looking at the actual disclosures in the Q where we have frequency down broadly 9%. That's year-over-year not pre-pandemic. And when I think about the broader environment that's actually counterintuitive to me because I'm thinking about the economy still being a little bit closed down a year ago, and frequency probably I would expect it to be increasing. And in fact when I look at available industry data it is increasing at least through six months. And so you seem to be moving in a different direction than I might have expected. And I wondered if you can add some color or possible reasons for why that might be happening? \nTricia Griffith: Yes. And the nine was for the quarter. We're down much more in frequency if you look at the trailing 12 versus the trailing 13 to 24 down more like in the 2% range. So I can't comment on how other people look at frequency, but we are down lower if you look at the time frame I just outlined. Do you want to have anything John? \nJohn Sauerland: Sure. Yes. We have done a lot to move to ensure we have profitable business coming in the door. So when you do that you're going to first seek to apply underwriting efforts against the highest frequency business likely that is producing the highest loss ratios. As Pat Callahan mentioned, we've also had some challenges getting price in some very large markets that have fairly high frequency as states. So in aggregate, I get your perspective, and we've noted the same but recognize that there's a lot going on with the mix of our business, due to where we've been growing or shrinking both geographically and at the segment level that is going to drive that number as well.\nGary Ransom: All right. That's helpful. Actually, that's a fairly positive statement on what you've been able to do versus what the rest of the industry is doing. But anyway, I had another question on Snapshot too. I noticed in the Q. It looked like there was an uptick in the attach rate for Snapshot particularly in Direct. And I wondered, whether there was something you were doing. Is that part of the advertising? And maybe you just have some general comments about the acceptance of that product in the market?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I'll add some general comments and then Pat, if you want to add anything. We have seen an uptick in new business for Snapshot is now in the low 30% range. The biggest of tickets in direct we have about 45% of our new business using Snapshot. And of course John talked about our continuous model, which we have. I think you said, hey, I'm not sure, if which is about 11% earned premium. So we're excited about that, to continue to gather data. We have a \u2013 in the continuous model, we have a deeper flat discount for participation and then steeper either factors from maximum discount and surcharge. So I don't know, if that's a big factor, but we do believe people see this as something where they can control part of their insurance cost and we're pretty excited about it. Pat, do you want to add anything? \nPat Callahan: Yeah. I would just echo the continuous evolution of the experience that we build around Snapshot to make it easier for consumers to find understand their savings, and then enroll in the program both in the direct channel and in the two-stage distribution through agents, because obviously getting agents on board that this is a good thing for their clients is important. We think part of it is process. So on the direct side, we've been continuing to improve the experience and invest there and have seen some recent wins in how we present the offer that's been helping. But we also think, there's some macroeconomic things going on, right? When there's an inflationary environment, consumers are squeezed, and they get a rate increase from their current carrier, when shopping, they want to save money, and we believe Snapshot is not only a personalized way to save money, but to get rewarded for safe driving behavior. And we think that's resonating, with a greater number of consumers, and the agents who sell our products over time.\nGary Ransom: Are the \u2013 is the attach rate or you said 45% for direct? Is there a similar number that you're willing to give on the agent at this point?\nTricia Griffith: No it's increasing somewhat especially from pre-pandemic. Like Pat said, it's a little bit more difficult to \u2013 we're really encouraging agencies that, as one of the many variables to make sure we get \u2013 we give our combined customers the best rates, if their driving behavior warrants the same.\nGary Ransom: All right. Thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Our next question is with Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yeah. Thank you. As we head into 2023, I'm no health insurance expert, but it seems to me that Medicare and a lot of the health insurers they set their rates earlier in the year. And while inflationary costs are built in right now, it may not be in the health insurance costs, which could mean we could see some severity increase on the bodily injury side next year. One I want to know if there's any truth in how I'm thinking about this? And two, given the duration of liabilities in your portfolio, what is the impact that might have on next year's results?\nTricia Griffith: What I would say from that perspective, obviously, we watch the cost that we incur for our bodily injury, but we also have inflation built into our reserving. So we build that in based on a lot of data and including what's happening in the healthcare. So those inflationary percentages are build it based on what's going on in the overall healthcare industry.\nJohn Sauerland: Yeah to set those inflation factors in our reserves, the product managers who are pricing at the state level will be reflecting those in their prices as well. And I think it's a valid concern. It's something that we are watching. And certainly to the extent we see medical inflation rate picking up, we will be dialing that into our prices as soon as we can.\nJosh Shanker: And in terms of your experience with distracted driving knowledge where are we at the trends we saw got emerging from the pandemic, is the extent which people are looking at their phones when they're driving, or hard braking, do we see changes in that from where we've been over the last 12 or 18 months?\nTricia Griffith: I can't speak specifically to distracted driving. I think we've reached those levels of ties have leveled off. They had an increase I think right win. There was less driving people. Speeds were higher, fatalities were higher. I think that's starting to level off. That might be the fact that there's more congestion because there are more people going back to work but I couldn't adequately give you specific number on that.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. I appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, your line is open.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey good morning. Question around policy in-force growth. I think in the quarter, it was up about 0.5%. Could you give a little color on that August and September have count that you said was at record levels? Could you put some numbers behind that and the potential for policy in-force growth in the fourth quarter?\nTricia Griffith: I don't know how much numbers I can put into it. I mean, obviously, PIF growth goes into both new business and renewal business. So a lot of it has to do with obviously our accruals, which we think is positive. It takes a little bit of time period in. And what I will say is our renewal growth looks very positive and we think a lot of that has to do with -- even if our insurers get an increase if they're shopping the likelihood of the leaving is lower. So we're seeing that renewal business increase as well. So we feel like we've reached the bottom from our retention perspective and that PIF growth should start to continue to improve.\nAndrew Kligerman: So maybe at least mid-single-digit PIF growth?\nTricia Griffith: I never like to guess. So you know what, two weeks from today you'll have our October results and then 30 days after that November results.\nAndrew Kligerman: All right. I won't push anymore. And then one question, apologies for another frequency question. But as I look at the 10-Qs and tell me if my math is right, if I look at today's frequency against pre-pandemic it's nearly up, its went down nearly down 20%. Is that good math? And if so, is there a reason -- and it was a great answer to the question before I get the business mix has changed a lot. But is there a reason to believe that maybe frequency could spike up very sharply and very quickly? I know Tricia you were saying that, you're going to look at it over the next two quarters. So one is my math right? And two, is there any reason to be concerned it could just sharply jump up at some point in the near-term?\nTricia Griffith: Your math is accurate. It's so hard to say, because it can change with so many variables. I do feel like it's become a little bit more stable in the last couple of quarters, but you can see with what happens really around the globe thing happens with back and fuel prices has been change dramatically. If work from home happens, if something happens, where we're hearing about flu season or the next variance of COVID those things can happen. We really can't predict those. We do watch those literally on a daily basis. And then, we can react to those once we have them. So we do see, we believe a little bit more stability, but I'd like to see several more quarters of that at least a few.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question is from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron, your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Hi and good morning. Excuse me. My first question is on used car prices coming down a bit and at the same time we've seen body shop labor already going up. So maybe it's a two-part question here. One, are you seeing the percentage of total vehicles drop? And two, be honest with the math of severity of used cars and severity of body shop labor. Are there other elements that we should be thinking about any like would LAE be different when you handle a total claim versus a body shop repair claim?\nTricia Griffith: Well, each loss is dependent on the severity of what's happening in the car. So, again that dynamic as employees are there, so they're going to handle kind of a mix of harder total losses and some easier hit. So that sort of washes out in the denominator. What I would say is, we have seen used car prices go down the mailing index. We're going to continue to watch that. And again, it takes some time because there's still a supply-demand issue. We're going to wait to see what happens with hurricane Ian. And we are seeing labor are up about 3% parts are up about 4% to 5%, the only other thing that we looked at that have been up it is pretty flat right now are rental severity.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe one follow-up on the related to LAE, so I understand that it is incremental and I don't know if you can give any additional quantification beyond incremental. But maybe another part of this would be in the LAE that you have for Ian, in September, did you already try and capture potentially additional LAE that you still expect to emerge kind of an got in IBNR if you will, or is that just for the month of September?\nTricia Griffith: Well, it was for the month of September, because we wanted to take the $200 million retention and assess the part for indemnity the part for LAE. So 25% is sort of our first assessment and that number will likely evolve over time.\nYaron Kinar: Sorry, I meant for the auto piece, not the property piece.\nTricia Griffith: For the property piece, in terms of LAE.\nYaron Kinar: For the auto piece, the LAE. Yes.\nTricia Griffith: Again, so the auto piece for LAE, that we don't actually separate that out. When we report we report loss plus LAE. But that, again, with the exception of some Travel and some hotels and stuff, we already have that baked in, because we already have a certain number of claims people on our books and a certain number of claims that will happen. And when a hurricane happens, that doesn't necessarily flex up because of that. We already have a CAT team. But if they're not handling weather-related events, they're doing other things within the claims organization.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy, your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Your auto new application growth is up 20%, mostly on the direct side. Can you touch on the quality of the new business you were seeing? I'm wondering, if your quote to bind ratio changed, as you\u2019re seeing more submission.\nTricia Griffith: I didn't hear the last part of your question, but the first part of the question is, we always believe that we put good business on the books, because we have so many variables that, as long as we can make our target profit margin, of course, that's different in new renewal, agency direct in each day, we always believe that the business we put on the books should be able to reach our target profit goals. And -- so I wouldn't want to fit in the books, that\u2019s where we have underwriting restrictions and other things. So that, we believe, is a good business. And of course, that evolves and we'll be able to tell you how that underlying is in the next coming months. I didn't hear the second part of your question.\nJohn Sauerland: About quote to bind ratio.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Yes. I was just referring -- \nJohn Sauerland: I was going to comment just quickly on the -- \nTracy Benguigui: Go ahead.\nJohn Sauerland: Go ahead. I've got your question on quote to bind, Tracey. Let me just comment on the quality just to build on Tricia's comments. So, obviously, we monitor the quality incoming business regularly and we have seen a significant spike in business coming from competitors, which is great, right? If competitors are raising rates, base rates and pushing customers to shop, we believe the power of our segmentation helps us select the right risks at the right rate for a lifetime profitability. So we look very closely at that quality of the business. We're always paranoid that we're getting business since someone else is shedding, but we're very comfortable with what we're writing. And as Tricia mentioned, we want to grow with the right business and we feel like we have that in place right now. As far as your quote-to-bind ratio question, there's a lot of moving parts in there, because when you have massive increases in shopping, you have different motivation levels of customers and conversion rate is, obviously, dependent on the mix of business that's shopping, how competitive our pricing is relative to where they're shopping from, because they're always comparing for a prior insurance customer what they're paying today versus what they could pay tomorrow. And that's where we think the power of segmentation, particularly in the agency channel, where comparative raters create effectively a transparency of rates across different carriers and segmentation and pricing accuracy enables us to grow in the right places, while avoiding adverse selection that potentially goes to our competitors.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. But directionally has it changed for you?\nJohn Sauerland: Directionally, conversion more recently is slightly down as we see prospect -- record prospect growth which is a normal dynamic I see more shoppers some are less motivated aggregate conversion does slide a little. \nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And then on a cohort basis, how many policy terms do you think it'll take for that new business to meet your combined ratio target? \nJohn Sauerland: So on a cohort basis obviously we look at a lifetime basis and it all depends on how quickly we grow right? We've gotten the question for, I think decades about the growth tax and how we think about new versus renewal. And I think as Tricia mentioned we will spend where we can be efficient in acquiring customers and acquire them at what we believe a new business combined ratio is that we'll produce our lifetime profit targets.  So with that construct as we think about it, if we grow quickly there will be potentially pressure on our calendar year combined ratio and we manage our expenses in order to ensure that we deliver on your expectations. \nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And can you comment how many policy terms did you take for that new bit of tax to not be please? \nJohn Sauerland: Maybe I can help out. We have different policy life expectancy by different segment of business. So, what we call a SAM and inconsistently insured customers they're not going to stick around long. So, we need to make our 96 in a very short period of time. Robinsons going stick a lot longer. So, we have a lot more time to make up the combined ratio over 100 perhaps on new business for a Robinson. So, it depends upon the segment of business that we're talking about. Lately we've been growing less on the Sam side, more on the Robinson side. So if you think about that dynamic hopefully that's helpful to your question. \nTracy Benguigui: It is. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question shall be from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thank you. Good morning, John mentioned that planned to price mostly to the Snapshot curve. And you see what that means maybe slightly excess profits and faster growth compared to what we saw maybe heading into COVID. And I think about that directionally correctly? \nJohn Sauerland: I would say no. So when we say not specifically to the curve, we would balance that on the end of the curve if you will. So early on with Snapshot when it was new for consumers, we weren't pricing to the maximum surcharge. We went pricing to the maximum discount. In fact, we didn't surcharge off, when we first brought out the model. Now that consumers understand it, are accepting of it, we can price to both ends of those spectrum. So this doesn't change at all the aggregate 96 target we have for all segments of our business inclusive of Snapshot.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification. And I guess the second issue, you mentioned early in the call, not the first time that resis generally reverse to taking significant rate increases. Can you talk to the opportunity to sort of embed inflationary sensitive components into the exposure base that you don't have the same problem if something else pricing?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean we tried to do that definitely in our reserving but in our pricing, we look at that and prospectively put that into our pricing model. But this has been sort of an extraordinary few years with the inflationary, especially in our industry with us in new car prices and social inflation. So we do believe those big increases are past us. And of course that could be a well we have to have a bigger increase based on something else other than that, but we feel good about that. Do you want to add anything? \nJohn Sauerland: Sure. We do have what we call monthly rating factors. So we have some escalators in our auto pricing. They are not reflective of an inflationary environment in which we have seen recently. So you're doing this prospectively and it requires regulatory approval. So we have call modest factors that inflate prices in many states not all on a monthly basis. On the property side, we also have the value of the home that we are reflecting that renewal which lately for sure has led to higher renewal prices outside of any increases we've taken. Does that helpful with your question? \nMeyer Shields: It does. I really -- I guess I would ask it more intelligently would that be about the potential for embedding the same sort of things that provide more premium automatically in property getting some of those in auto?\nTricia Griffith: I think we are with the monthly rating factors as well as the incremental increases and then the dwelling increases that John talked about on the property side. \nJohn Sauerland: Yeah, the piece we're going to ensure, we're more responsive on the auto frequency side is that continuous monitoring. So the more we drive people to adopt snapshot or UBI rating and a continuous rating model, we can adapt more quickly to things that change in how they drive or how much they drive over time. So that provides a little more responsive than we have in today's model.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nDoug Constantine: We exhausted our scheduled time. So that concludes our event. Austin, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing sections.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. When our customers interact with us they're often doing so on their worst day, maybe their vehicle was just stolen, maybe they were injured in a car accident or their property damage was analyzed. This fact comes into even sharper focus during a major catastrophe such as Hurricane Ian. While watching the footage of devastation, my heart went out to all those who were affected by the storm. For millions it was truly their worst day. And I'm proud of the part Progressive plays to help people recover from such a calamitous event. Within hours after the storm, Progressive had over 1,500 people ready to help our customers start to rebuild their lives. And while we cannot always replace what was lost, our people are in place to make it as easy as possible for our customers to return to normalcy. Thank you to all the Progressive customers who trust us to make their worst day more manageable. In my letter, I shared some of the Herculean efforts that our employees were making on behalf of our customers and there are many more where that came from. Needless to say, I'm very proud of so many. While, Hurricane Ian was the largest single event in the third quarter, it was not the whole story. Excluding catastrophe losses, our third quarter company-wide combined ratio improved 1.9 points year-over-year and illustrates the significant work we've done to combat the effects of inflation and working towards achieving our goal of an underwriting margin of at least 4%, specifically in personal auto. As we stated after the first quarter, with the exception of a few markets, our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us, so we continue to be vigilant and adjust rates as our loss experience develops. In the third quarter, we increased personal auto rates in 20 states at average of about 5% per state for a total countrywide premium impact of plus 2%. The third quarter rate action brings our countrywide year-to-date rate increases to nearly 12%. We continue to closely monitor frequency and severity trends to ensure we stay true to our stated goal of profit before growth. So we have continued to take rate. We believe we took rate earlier than the industry, which initially negatively impacted volume, but more recently has created opportunities for growth. Consumer shopping and quoting has increased more than 20% in both the agency and direct channels. In fact in both channels we had the best July, August and September in our company's history for quote volume. This prospect growth is despite a lower acquisition expense ratio as compared to 2021, allowing us to be a beneficiary, as competitors have pulled back on marketing spend. This combination of lower competitor spend and our continued advancement of the science of media planning and buying, led to an incredible increase in efficiency in our media spend and has helped propel this quarter's growth. Auto quote growth coupled with continued improvement in conversion, as our competitors raised rates, led to auto new application growth of 20% in the quarter including the highest August and highest September combined to channel new application volume that we've seen in the company's history. Total personal auto year-over-year PIF growth is still negative, but we've now seen several months of sequential monthly PIF growth led by the growth in the direct channel and flattening in the agency channel. The sequential growth has been bolstered not only by new application growth but signs of improving retention. In last quarter's call, we spent considerable time talking about our property business and efforts we are taking to return to profitable growth. The losses incurred from Hurricane Ian further highlight the need to shift our mix to less volatile state. As expected, PIF growth in properties slowed in the quarter, as we make progress in this multiyear goal. Our assets continue unabated with rate and non-rate actions, as we work towards a mix that is more reflective of the market.  Given this volatile backdrop, it's only natural that the insurance industry would be facing questions regarding capital. So we thought it would be useful to quickly summarize our strong capital position. As discussed in our annual report, we view our capital position as consisting of multiple layers. First, in our insurance operating subsidiaries, we maintain adequate surplus to support growing as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. Our extreme contingency layer includes capital in excess of regulatory capital that ensures on a model basis, a less than 100 and 200 probability that we will need to raise additional capital. We have $4.2 billion that we held at quarter end in a non-insurance subsidiary of the holding company level, which is well access of that contingency layer and is highly liquid due to mostly being comprised of short-term securities and treasuries. While we have incurred temporary losses in our investment portfolio due to the significant move in interest rates, our fixed portfolio is extremely conservative with over half of the portfolio in cash or treasuries and a portfolio duration at the end of the quarter at 2.7 years. Throughout the year, we have taken proactive measures to prepare the portfolio for various scenarios by reducing interest rate, credit and equity risk. Another proactive measure we took was to raise $1.5 billion of 5, 10- and 30-year debt in March at an average 3% interest rate. Due to the highly uncertain outlook, we felt it was prudent to have extra capital at what we viewed as very attractive borrowing rates. As we sit, we have no near-term bond maturities that we have to address in this higher interest rate environment, the combination of the borrowing along with significant interest -- increase in interest rates have been the primary drivers in moving our debt to total capital ratio over 30% at September month end to 30.2%. We expect underwriting gains changes in the value of our bond portfolio as bonds approach maturity and investment income to bring us back below 30% in time. We are currently taking no additional actions to bring the ratio below 30% and have no near-term plan or need for raising further capital. Again, thank you for joining us and now we'll take your questions. Yeah, absolutely. Let me start Elyse with the LAE. So when you think about vehicles, which I would include auto and special lines, there's not much incremental LAE when a catastrophe happens. So for years and years we built up a CAT team and it's now commensurate to the size that we are. So when a CAT happens, really the incremental LAE on that part is travel costs, hotel costs, et cetera. And then during the year those people are able to do other things. So as an example in Ian right now they're in Florida working those files. But then as that slows down, if there aren't other weather related events or catastrophes, they might go work in the salvage department to work through that salvage. So it's not hugely incremental. We called it out on the property side, because that is a little bit more incremental on that $25 million of the $200 million of the reinsurance. And that was because we do use some independent appraiser's adjusters to help with the property claim. So that's the reason why we called it out. And that will evolve. We wanted to assess a certain point for LAE and a certain point for loss, and that will evolve as the storm developed. In terms of where we're at, I do feel very comfortable. Like I said in most markets there are a few that we don't have the rate we need. And we're going to continue to take smaller bites of the apple, which is what we prefer to do and that's why I wanted to outline that in my letter and opening comments. But here's how I would think about where we're at from the perspective of adequate rates. And this is a very high level. So you'd have to think about this in terms of new versus renewal, channel, et cetera. So our frequency is down 9%, our severity is up 13% in aggregate. So think about a 4% net loss ratio. Our average written premium is up 8%. So you want to think of that maybe about 6.5 points to earn in. So when I think about that I feel good about where we're at again. We're watching inflation very closely. But we do feel, I'm confident that in most venues we have the rate we need to grow and we'll try to propel that growth where we can and slow where we don't believe our rates are adequate. Does that help? Nothing in particular and this is the curse of releasing monthly earnings. I wouldn't look into one month and put much into that. Well, we look at the components. But what I would say is, although the wholesale prices are trending down, they're still at all-time high. So we will continue to watch that. And I think especially, we will watch it based on the fact that there are a lot of total losses that have happened in Florida with Hurricane Ian, so that could even increase demand. So, we try to break out as much as we can. When we look at severity, we look more at overall loss cost in terms of size of vehicles, labor rates, parts prices, rental price, et cetera. So, there's a lot of components that go into that. But, we're going to wait and see and continue to watch the Manheim Index and watch what happens after Ian and if we -- and we'll see that in our severity trends. Thanks, Elyse. Sure Michael. So, in quarter three with our snapshot data, we saw vehicle miles traveled down about 11%. Previously, it was down about 14%. What we're seeing is commute miles have stayed flat. And during the quarter, we saw that traveled miles. So think of those defined as queuing from your home, 100 miles queuing from your home. So we think that might have been based on some lower gas prices, people were doing some last-minute travel because of those prices in their cars in -- during before Labor Day visiting grandma or whatever, and that usually involves less losses. So, come it's more congestion, you're going to have more losses. So we think about it that way. I don't think we'll know where frequency sort of trend long-term, until probably a quarter or two, because I know a lot of companies said, they were returning to work after Labor Day. So you're thinking in September. So what we'd like to do is, wait at least a couple of quarters to see if that sort of bottomed out and look at that pre-pandemic to 2019. And then we'll feel I think a little bit more confident, because I know a lot of companies have gone back and forth on how often their employees need to work. And I think a lot of it will depend too on COVID and flu, et cetera. So we're going to wait a few quarters, but that's what we're seeing right now on our UBI data. Well, I don't know that we changed the strategy. It just happened to be that cars were more expensive, so it took more to total them. And then we did total them part -- components were more expenses. So we'll always look at the actual cash value of the vehicle and then the cost repair, which could take into account rental, et cetera. So that's how we always look at it. And then you overlay the actual cost of the cars whether new or used when you make those assessments. Great point. Thanks, Michael. So on the bodily injury side, Mike? Yes. We've actually seen the bodily injury has been fairly stable in the kind of 6% to 8% range. And of course it went up after the pandemic that was based on more attorney representation, more soft tissue attorney representation not necessarily litigation and then just the overall social inflation. But we're seeing that level out in the 6% to 8% range. Yes. I mean, it's hard to say because during the pandemic, there was little or none and then I think it went up pretty significantly. So yes, I think that would be accurate to say in that range of pre-pandemic. No, I think you're thinking -- well, we're thinking about it all the time. The hard part is -- there's so many macroeconomic trends that affects frequency. You saw that with gas prices. And so, I think there's a lot of things that we constantly look at in our models. I think, the best thing, when we think of pricing for our customers, is to encourage them to use snapshot. And that's us a big approach for people, who want to be able to save money, especially if they are not driving. So, we've seen an uptick in the take rate and our mix of business, new business in UBI. And we think that's great because, if consumers cars are sitting in their garages, more often than not, they should get a discount as long as when they're driving that they're driving safely. Yes. No, not necessarily. Yes. We have had a long-term strategy to grow as fast as we can at/or below a 96 combined ratio. That will continue. That's something that's worked for us 85 years or at least since we went public in 1971, we first started talking about the 96. So, we will do that. We watch trends very, very diligently and take actions quickly when -- and decisively when we need to. Unfortunately, in this last year, we've had to take rate increases that we normally do to take. We don't like to take huge rate increases unlike we have. Like, we talk about smaller bites of the apple, which we believe we're now in a position to take as things change in each venue. So, our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to try to grow as fast as we can. Obviously, with the hurricane we're over 96, so we have a few months to go and we're going to continue to try to leverage this really unique opportunity to get growth while still maintaining our 96 combined ratio. In fact, in September, we had our lowest cost per sale since 2017. So, we're seeing really the advantage of the -- because our competitors aren't advertising as much and are taking rate, we're seeing some really great ambient growth. So, we're going to try to pull all the levers to do that to grow as fast as we can but we do have the 96 that we believe we always talk about profit over growth. I'll have Dave talk about reinsurance but I'll hit on the sort of de-risking the book. I will say that reinsurance costs we are able to pass on so that is one benefit. But clearly that market is hardening. So, we talked about our goal of de-risking the portfolio specifically moving 60,000 policies out of Florida -- homes out of Florida sort of mitigate that risk. It takes a while. So we talked about that last year. We had a 90-day notification period to our customers. So, in earnest we started non-renewing those 60,000 in May of 2022. And then there was a special legislative session and there was a Senate Bill that allowed us -- allows homeowners to renew their policy as long as they could prove through inspection that they had at least five years of useful life left on their roof, which is great because that's okay with us and at least we know the rate to risk when we know how old the roof is. So, we knew that there would be less than 60,000 policies and it would take a little bit longer. And then, of course, enter Hurricane Ian and there's been a moratorium on non-renews and cancellations from September 28th to November 28th, so we won't be able to not renew any. Until after that is lifted those executive orders are lifted. So, suffice it to say that it's going to take us a little bit longer to de-risk and we get that and we'll continue to update everyone as that happens. I will say that we are not open for new business in A3 DPI or A06, so home, dwelling fire, and condo and we will not be open for new business until the executive order is lifted. The only caveat is we have some new homes with a select group of builders brand-new homes that we will be working with them, so they can close and have insurance on their home. So, I think the punchline is it's a volatile environment but we remain focused on achieving our goal and having our portfolio of homes across the country and not based on all the risky areas. So, Dave do you want to add anything on the reinsurance Thanks, Alex. Yes, I can map out sort of what's happened and how we're positioned for the future. So, we had such an opportunity in our four higher trucking business markets here, when the pandemic happened. So many people, as I'm sure you did you're having lots of good ships. So obviously, you had the trucking industry grew, and it grew in different ways. So, we had -- spot rates are up. So a lot of owner-operators would leave from a carrier and go on their own to be able to make it on their own. We were there for them. We were there at the right rate, and we had a history of this customer. So, it's a really beautiful growth. So even when you look at that 2%, you've got to look at the denominator because the last couple of years have been unbelievably successful in commercial lines. So now that spot rates have gone down a little bit and softened, some of those carriers are going -- some of those owner operators are going back to carriers, we do have a couple coverages, non-trucker liability and GL where we can keep those pits, when they're not -- when they're away from doing business with the carrier that they're part of. So we think we'll continue to grow. So that's more of a retention piece. What I would say is, the opportunity that we have is because we're so diversified in commercial. So think of -- a few years ago, we only wrote 10 or fewer power units. Now we went to 40 and then of course, we purchased Protective, which could give us an opportunity to be able to ensure some of those medium to large fleets. So we feel really good about our position there. And of course, Smart we have in nearly 40 states, I think 37, and that will continue to grow. Those are things we invested in three-plus years ago, because we know that this -- the commercial lines is very cyclical and very linked to macroeconomic trends. So although, the growth is smaller on a percentage basis, we've grown tremendously in commercial lines. We have a tremendous plan laid out a 10-year plan, Karen Herd your team have laid out to continue to grow and continue to diversify to make sure that we're able to be there when a different economic shift happens. Yes, it's very conceivable. So we look at expense ratio with the regular expenses and non-acquisition expense ratios. We will spend \u2013 given the takeaway to 96 for a moment, we will spend as much as we can as long as we believe it's efficient. So while our expense ratio is lower now, like I said, we're really bullish on growth for this quarter because of what we being in the ambient shopping and just the environment based on our competitors' spending and our competitors' rates. So yes, you could see it go up if we continue to spend in advertising. I will say that we're constantly looking at our plan on both loss ratio or expense ratio and LAE to make sure we can continue to be efficient because we do want to spend more in the acquisition funnel. So yes, you could see it go up a little bit as we determine what the right spend is. And of course, we have the 96 governor so that is going into play a little bit right now. Thanks, Greg. I'll let Pat take that. I'm not sure of the exact number. I believe it's less than 17 though, but I'm not sure exactly. Again, we look at that just based on our ability to grow and our ability to get the right rate. So in the states where we can't get rate, obviously we'll continue to make sure that we do everything we can not to grow. Some we're just waiting for the rates to earn in and we'll start to loosen up those underwriting guidelines and the local media spend. Pat do you want to add anything? Yes, absolutely. So the primary -- the best use I should say of our capital is to grow the firm. And that's what we're going to try to do, especially, like we said in this unique environment. So we have this conversation every time we meet with the Board, we'll be with them again in December. And if we don't believe we can grow, of course, we give it back in either dividends or stock buybacks we -- at this juncture, I can't say whether or not we'll have a variable dividend that will ultimately be the Board's decision. I will tell you that, I want to take advantage and leverage this opportunity to grow the firm. Thanks, David. Yes. And the nine was for the quarter. We're down much more in frequency if you look at the trailing 12 versus the trailing 13 to 24 down more like in the 2% range. So I can't comment on how other people look at frequency, but we are down lower if you look at the time frame I just outlined. Do you want to have anything John? Yeah. I'll add some general comments and then Pat, if you want to add anything. We have seen an uptick in new business for Snapshot is now in the low 30% range. The biggest of tickets in direct we have about 45% of our new business using Snapshot. And of course John talked about our continuous model, which we have. I think you said, hey, I'm not sure, if which is about 11% earned premium. So we're excited about that, to continue to gather data. We have a \u2013 in the continuous model, we have a deeper flat discount for participation and then steeper either factors from maximum discount and surcharge. So I don't know, if that's a big factor, but we do believe people see this as something where they can control part of their insurance cost and we're pretty excited about it. Pat, do you want to add anything? No it's increasing somewhat especially from pre-pandemic. Like Pat said, it's a little bit more difficult to \u2013 we're really encouraging agencies that, as one of the many variables to make sure we get \u2013 we give our combined customers the best rates, if their driving behavior warrants the same. Thanks, Gary. What I would say from that perspective, obviously, we watch the cost that we incur for our bodily injury, but we also have inflation built into our reserving. So we build that in based on a lot of data and including what's happening in the healthcare. So those inflationary percentages are build it based on what's going on in the overall healthcare industry. I can't speak specifically to distracted driving. I think we've reached those levels of ties have leveled off. They had an increase I think right win. There was less driving people. Speeds were higher, fatalities were higher. I think that's starting to level off. That might be the fact that there's more congestion because there are more people going back to work but I couldn't adequately give you specific number on that. Thanks Josh. I don't know how much numbers I can put into it. I mean, obviously, PIF growth goes into both new business and renewal business. So a lot of it has to do with obviously our accruals, which we think is positive. It takes a little bit of time period in. And what I will say is our renewal growth looks very positive and we think a lot of that has to do with -- even if our insurers get an increase if they're shopping the likelihood of the leaving is lower. So we're seeing that renewal business increase as well. So we feel like we've reached the bottom from our retention perspective and that PIF growth should start to continue to improve. I never like to guess. So you know what, two weeks from today you'll have our October results and then 30 days after that November results. Your math is accurate. It's so hard to say, because it can change with so many variables. I do feel like it's become a little bit more stable in the last couple of quarters, but you can see with what happens really around the globe thing happens with back and fuel prices has been change dramatically. If work from home happens, if something happens, where we're hearing about flu season or the next variance of COVID those things can happen. We really can't predict those. We do watch those literally on a daily basis. And then, we can react to those once we have them. So we do see, we believe a little bit more stability, but I'd like to see several more quarters of that at least a few. Thank you, Andrew. Well, each loss is dependent on the severity of what's happening in the car. So, again that dynamic as employees are there, so they're going to handle kind of a mix of harder total losses and some easier hit. So that sort of washes out in the denominator. What I would say is, we have seen used car prices go down the mailing index. We're going to continue to watch that. And again, it takes some time because there's still a supply-demand issue. We're going to wait to see what happens with hurricane Ian. And we are seeing labor are up about 3% parts are up about 4% to 5%, the only other thing that we looked at that have been up it is pretty flat right now are rental severity. Well, it was for the month of September, because we wanted to take the $200 million retention and assess the part for indemnity the part for LAE. So 25% is sort of our first assessment and that number will likely evolve over time. For the property piece, in terms of LAE. Again, so the auto piece for LAE, that we don't actually separate that out. When we report we report loss plus LAE. But that, again, with the exception of some Travel and some hotels and stuff, we already have that baked in, because we already have a certain number of claims people on our books and a certain number of claims that will happen. And when a hurricane happens, that doesn't necessarily flex up because of that. We already have a CAT team. But if they're not handling weather-related events, they're doing other things within the claims organization. Thanks. I didn't hear the last part of your question, but the first part of the question is, we always believe that we put good business on the books, because we have so many variables that, as long as we can make our target profit margin, of course, that's different in new renewal, agency direct in each day, we always believe that the business we put on the books should be able to reach our target profit goals. And -- so I wouldn't want to fit in the books, that's where we have underwriting restrictions and other things. So that, we believe, is a good business. And of course, that evolves and we'll be able to tell you how that underlying is in the next coming months. I didn't hear the second part of your question. Yeah. I mean we tried to do that definitely in our reserving but in our pricing, we look at that and prospectively put that into our pricing model. But this has been sort of an extraordinary few years with the inflationary, especially in our industry with us in new car prices and social inflation. So we do believe those big increases are past us. And of course that could be a well we have to have a bigger increase based on something else other than that, but we feel good about that. Do you want to add anything? I think we are with the monthly rating factors as well as the incremental increases and then the dwelling increases that John talked about on the property side. Thank you."

            "content": "Okay and one clarification to that. So Tricia mentioned frequency or vehicle miles traveled was down 11% that was referencing the pre-pandemic period. So when we think about vehicle mile travel, we continue to measure it relative to pre-COVID and interestingly, frequency is down a bit more than vehicle miles traveled and that's continued for quite some time has not yet come back. And we believe to Tricia's comments that, that is due to some degree to the mix of miles traveled. Just a little more clarification on that sense since Lisa had a similar question. When we think about the increase in severity for physical damage coverages, so property damage collision, et cetera walking around numbers about half of that increase is from the increase in used car values. That is both when we total a car but as Tricia was mentioning you total fewer cars, because the car is worth more. So you're going to -- your estimates on repairs are going to go up as a result of used car prices as well. So it's a little tough to tease out but sort of walking around is probably half of the severity increases we've seen physical damage coverages are due to the increase in values. We continue to price as accurately as we can with the data we have. So, as our snapshot database continues to grow and we move to a continuous monitoring model, we have an increasing data set to work with and an ongoing data set to work with, because we have continuous monitoring. And I think, in eight states now and are continuing to roll that across the country. Early on with Snapshot, we weren't pricing completely to the curve, if you will. And as consumer adoption, as Tricia noted, has gotten to be really good and growing. We've been more and more comfortable with pricing to the full curve, which is the best accurate segmentation we can get. I'd also add, that if you have some multiyear agreements. So our entire program is normally not up for renewal in any given year, which helps us mitigate the impact of increases and allows us to better put those increases into our primary prices. We do also use some insurance-linked securities, if you will also cap bonds. So we're trying to diversify, our reinsurance and catastrophe coverage program both for time and for the instruments we use to ensure that we are stable as possible. \nQ \u2013 Alex Scott: Got it. Thank you. Sure. Yes. We have done a lot to move to ensure we have profitable business coming in the door. So when you do that you're going to first seek to apply underwriting efforts against the highest frequency business likely that is producing the highest loss ratios. As Pat Callahan mentioned, we've also had some challenges getting price in some very large markets that have fairly high frequency as states. So in aggregate, I get your perspective, and we've noted the same but recognize that there's a lot going on with the mix of our business, due to where we've been growing or shrinking both geographically and at the segment level that is going to drive that number as well. Yeah to set those inflation factors in our reserves, the product managers who are pricing at the state level will be reflecting those in their prices as well. And I think it's a valid concern. It's something that we are watching. And certainly to the extent we see medical inflation rate picking up, we will be dialing that into our prices as soon as we can. About quote to bind ratio. I was going to comment just quickly on the -- Go ahead. I've got your question on quote to bind, Tracey. Let me just comment on the quality just to build on Tricia's comments. So, obviously, we monitor the quality incoming business regularly and we have seen a significant spike in business coming from competitors, which is great, right? If competitors are raising rates, base rates and pushing customers to shop, we believe the power of our segmentation helps us select the right risks at the right rate for a lifetime profitability. So we look very closely at that quality of the business. We're always paranoid that we're getting business since someone else is shedding, but we're very comfortable with what we're writing. And as Tricia mentioned, we want to grow with the right business and we feel like we have that in place right now. As far as your quote-to-bind ratio question, there's a lot of moving parts in there, because when you have massive increases in shopping, you have different motivation levels of customers and conversion rate is, obviously, dependent on the mix of business that's shopping, how competitive our pricing is relative to where they're shopping from, because they're always comparing for a prior insurance customer what they're paying today versus what they could pay tomorrow. And that's where we think the power of segmentation, particularly in the agency channel, where comparative raters create effectively a transparency of rates across different carriers and segmentation and pricing accuracy enables us to grow in the right places, while avoiding adverse selection that potentially goes to our competitors. Directionally, conversion more recently is slightly down as we see prospect -- record prospect growth which is a normal dynamic I see more shoppers some are less motivated aggregate conversion does slide a little. So on a cohort basis obviously we look at a lifetime basis and it all depends on how quickly we grow right? We've gotten the question for, I think decades about the growth tax and how we think about new versus renewal. And I think as Tricia mentioned we will spend where we can be efficient in acquiring customers and acquire them at what we believe a new business combined ratio is that we'll produce our lifetime profit targets.  So with that construct as we think about it, if we grow quickly there will be potentially pressure on our calendar year combined ratio and we manage our expenses in order to ensure that we deliver on your expectations. Maybe I can help out. We have different policy life expectancy by different segment of business. So, what we call a SAM and inconsistently insured customers they're not going to stick around long. So, we need to make our 96 in a very short period of time. Robinsons going stick a lot longer. So, we have a lot more time to make up the combined ratio over 100 perhaps on new business for a Robinson. So, it depends upon the segment of business that we're talking about. Lately we've been growing less on the Sam side, more on the Robinson side. So if you think about that dynamic hopefully that's helpful to your question. I would say no. So when we say not specifically to the curve, we would balance that on the end of the curve if you will. So early on with Snapshot when it was new for consumers, we weren't pricing to the maximum surcharge. We went pricing to the maximum discount. In fact, we didn't surcharge off, when we first brought out the model. Now that consumers understand it, are accepting of it, we can price to both ends of those spectrum. So this doesn't change at all the aggregate 96 target we have for all segments of our business inclusive of Snapshot. Sure. We do have what we call monthly rating factors. So we have some escalators in our auto pricing. They are not reflective of an inflationary environment in which we have seen recently. So you're doing this prospectively and it requires regulatory approval. So we have call modest factors that inflate prices in many states not all on a monthly basis. On the property side, we also have the value of the home that we are reflecting that renewal which lately for sure has led to higher renewal prices outside of any increases we've taken. Does that helpful with your question? Yeah, the piece we're going to ensure, we're more responsive on the auto frequency side is that continuous monitoring. So the more we drive people to adopt snapshot or UBI rating and a continuous rating model, we can adapt more quickly to things that change in how they drive or how much they drive over time. So that provides a little more responsive than we have in today's model."

            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "Yes, without sharing kind of number of states because your question about percent of premium is kind of the most relevant piece. The other piece that's complex is we say local media, but there's seven different elements of local media, whether it's digital paid social, direct mail lots of things going on in that space. I think what's important is to get back to Tricia's comment about we will spend when we can afford to spend based on the calendar year targets, when the spend is efficient relative to lifetime performance on the media, and frankly when we need to spend to drive growth. And that's where it's pretty dynamic at the channel level and ultimately the split within local media where we decide to spend versus not spend. So right now we have some states, a couple of big ones on the coast where we don't yet have adequate rates on the street and we're optimizing obviously the efficiency of our expenses there given our loss ratios are high because we can't get the rate that we need under the expected losses. So what I would say is, it's dynamic and we make adjustments all the time. And as soon as we get adequate rate we are open for business. And increasingly, we are getting adequate rates in some additional states. It's just taking longer than we had expected to previously. Yeah. I would just echo the continuous evolution of the experience that we build around Snapshot to make it easier for consumers to find understand their savings, and then enroll in the program both in the direct channel and in the two-stage distribution through agents, because obviously getting agents on board that this is a good thing for their clients is important. We think part of it is process. So on the direct side, we've been continuing to improve the experience and invest there and have seen some recent wins in how we present the offer that's been helping. But we also think, there's some macroeconomic things going on, right? When there's an inflationary environment, consumers are squeezed, and they get a rate increase from their current carrier, when shopping, they want to save money, and we believe Snapshot is not only a personalized way to save money, but to get rewarded for safe driving behavior. And we think that's resonating, with a greater number of consumers, and the agents who sell our products over time."

I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be the moderator for today's event. \n The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website.\n This quarter marks a return to our typical format, which is a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.\n As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\n To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia? \nSusan Griffith: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, we continue to work through the challenges handed to us through the macroeconomic environment. Uncertainty has been the theme of our post-COVID world, and that has continued into the second quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the way the organization has responded. Flexibility was our theme for the 2021 annual report, and our people have continued to exhibit flexibility into 2022. \n During the second quarter, we continued to feel the impact of inflation with used car prices still near all-time highs and continued rising cost to repair vehicles. On the other hand, record high fuel costs and the resulting reduced driving provides a modest tailwind to auto frequency. We will continue to monitor the environment closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure we meet our promise to 96 combined ratio. \n As we stated in the first quarter, we believe our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us. and that's reflected in our slowing pace of second quarter rate changes. In the quarter, we raised rates in 17 states, which had about a 2% increase countrywide, bringing our year-to-date rate increase to about 9% and our year-over-year rate increase to about 16%. While these rate changes continue to have the expected effect on PIF growth, I'm encouraged by recent results.  \n As competitors took rate and we increased our investment in direct acquisition in many markets, we have seen prospect volume rise, and June marked the first month since May of 2021 with year-over-year new app growth in our direct channel. While the path ahead undoubtedly contains many obstacles, I'm encouraged to see our efforts bear fruit.  \n I'd now like to change focus to the main topic of today's presentation, which is our property business. While our state expansion to write property insurance has enabled us to increase our addressable market and accelerate growth in the important Robinsons segment, it's no secret that we have faced challenges. \n Over the last 5 years, we've been unable to consistently run the business at our target margins. And between 2017 and 2021, have posted an underwriting loss. We were the first to admit that we have work to do to get this business on track. As I mentioned in my letter, our current pricing and underwriting activities do not adequately address weather-driven volatility. And we are in the process of executing a number of steps to turn the business around. \n We realize these actions will require more time than originally anticipated to ensure consistent delivery of our target combined ratio for the property business. As such, we have revised our expected underwriting profitability over the coming years, which led to a write-off of $225 million of goodwill, primarily related to our purchase of ARX Holding Corp. The remaining $228 million of goodwill is also primarily attributable to the acquisition and reflects the increase in addressable market we gain for our Agency auto product that bundling represents. \n The team of people working on our property business continues to focus time on improving our underwriting, managing risk concentration and more precisely matching rate to risk at a much more granular level. For the last 5 years, Dave Pratt, our soon-to-be retired Property General Manager, has worked closely with senior leaders from ASI as they transformed our property business from a regional carrier to the tenth largest property carrier in the country, now writing in 47 states. \n With Dave's impending retirement next year, Tanya Fjare, who has more than 20 years' experience at ASI and Progressive has taken over leadership of our property P&L and is partnering with supporting groups across Progressive from product, claims, IT, legal and finance to ensure we're building the products, experiences and team to create the broadly available and competitively priced and profitable product offering that we've all grown to expect from Progressive. While we cannot change course overnight, today, we will share the steps we are taking today to reach our goal. \n For our main presentation today, first, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President and nearly 20-year Progressive veteran, will discuss our market opportunity and our investments in property product distribution. Following Pat, Dave Pratt will go into more detail on our results, the investments we've made in people and product and a real-world case study on how our actions have resulted in favorable results. Dave is a 31-year Progressive employee who has held numerous roles throughout his illustrious career. Dave has been an important part of Progressive's success over his decades of service, and we will miss him upon his upcoming retirement. \n Thank you again for joining us. And now I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat? \nPatrick Callahan: Thanks, Tricia. While our focus has historically been on vehicle insurance, we've always recognized that property insurance is an important segment of U.S. personal lines. And as we continue to grow our personal auto business, meeting the property needs of our growing auto customer base is increasingly important. \n Over more than a decade, we've regularly shared our investments to meet those needs as part of our Destination Era strategy. These began back in 2008 through our Progressive Home Advantage partnerships. And today, Dave and I will restate the business case for investing in property, share our progress driving market share growth and more importantly, the initiatives underway to ensure that we deliver profitable property growth in support of becoming consumers' and agents' #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. \n The U.S. property and casualty market is almost $800 billion in premiums written and more than 90% of that isn't yet insured with us. Today's focus is on the $381 billion U.S. personal lines market, where we enjoy about 10% of the combined U.S. auto and home market share. We're the third largest auto writer with almost 14% share, while today, we write just below 2% of the U.S. homeowners market. \n Despite many reports of its demise due to technology advancements reducing accident frequency, U.S. auto direct premiums written grew about 4% annually over the past 5 years. And at more than $260 billion, the U.S. auto market continues to represent a growth opportunity. The U.S. homeowners market continues to grow faster than auto, at more than 5% annually over the past 5 years and more than 8% growth in 2021. \n Recent inflationary forces, loss cost increases and resulting rate increases are further accelerating growth in both the U.S. home and auto markets. Let's break this down by channel and segment. \n I expect that many of you are familiar with how we think about consumer market segments across channel, protection needs and auto and home bundle status. The rows on this table are the 3 largest U.S. distribution channels: captive agent, independent agent and direct-to-consumer. While all 3 channels have been growing premiums written, channel share has been slowly migrating from captive agents to direct as technology adoption drives continued e-commerce migration across industries. The independent agent channel continues to maintain share due to its strong consumer value proposition, which combines local agent expertise with the breadth of product availability and depth of carrier options that deliver the ease and savings that consumers value. \n The columns here are Progressive's consumer segments from simple needs inconsistently insured, auto-only households or Sams; to continuously insured renters, Dianes; to consistently insured but unbundled homeowners, Wrights; to our well-known bundled auto and home Robinsons. You'll note that our market share is approaching 20% for the combined Sam, Diane and Wrights market, while we remain underpenetrated with Robinsons at less than 3% share. Note that this Robinson share does not include the more than $1 billion written by unaffiliated carriers through the direct Progressive Advantage Agency. \n You'll also note that more than half of the combined U.S. auto and home market is bundled. And more than 80% of that is bundled through an agent. The captive agent channel currently over-indexes on Robinson's share, but as more Robinsons migrate to the direct and independent agent channels we'll benefit due to strong market share across each of those channels. Our focus on Robinsons is driven by our untapped potential in this large and growing market segment, which makes up more than half of the total U.S. personal lines market.\n We've shared in prior investor presentations that current period financials fail to fully reflect the hidden balance sheet of future growth as our current customers both continue to renew and expand their relationship with Progressive, which delivers both top and bottom line financial benefit for years to come. Investing to expand our offerings to better penetrate the existing approximately $200 billion Robinsons market creates value in 2 critical ways. \n First, we drive top and bottom line calendar period unit, premium and underwriting profit growth through acquiring customers who bundle their auto and home today. As I shared on the last slide, more than half of the U.S. auto and home market is bundled. So when these customers shop and switch, it's critical for us to have a competitive bundled offer to meet their needs. The nature of these Robinsons bundled homeowners is inherently more stable than other customer segments. And they also have approximately 3x the policy life expectancy of our Sams segment. Acquiring Robinsons drives growth both today and in future periods. \n Second, for more than 85 years, we've been a leader in acquiring simpler needs, monoline auto customers, and we continue to view this as an important pipeline of future growth. Ensuring we have broadly available and competitively priced renters, condo and homeowners offerings is essential to ensure we meet the needs of these customers throughout their lifetimes. As we nurture these younger and simpler needs customers throughout their life events, we create and capture value for the firm today and unlock future growth potential. \n Since embarking on our Destination Era strategy, we've made major investments in acquiring ASI, launching new quoting platforms across channels, building our in-house Advantage agency, creating a Platinum offering for our independent agent partners and investing well over $1 billion on bundle and save branding and marketing in just the past 3 years. \n These investments are driving Robinsons growth across distribution channels, which validates the potential for us to grow in this important market segment. While our property profitability hasn't consistently met our expectations. We also write more than $3 billion in profitable auto premium for these Robinson households across channels. And while some of that would likely have been accessible without the complementary property offering, we're confident that having broadly available and competitively priced property is helping to drive this growth.\n As I shared a few minutes ago, more than 80% of the bundled auto and home business we're looking to acquire is distributed through agents. The Robinson opportunity through independent agents alone represents more than $60 billion in annualized premiums written. And as the largest seller of auto through the independent agent channel, we are well positioned to leverage our massive distribution footprint and more than 85 years of experience selling through agents to grow our share in the channel. \n I wanted to highlight 2 key initiatives that facilitate our independent agent channel Robinsons growth. First, recognizing that Progressive has historically been an industry leader in ease of use for agents and customers, we built a streamlined quote experience for the home and auto bundle, which makes it fast and easy for agents to enter customer information once and quote and sell a bundle of most of the Progressive vehicle and property products, either upfront or over time as customers experience life events and need more and/or different protection products. \n Second, shortly after buying and controlling interest in ASI, we launched our Platinum program, which affords unique customer and agent benefits for bundling home and auto with Progressive. Over the past several years, we've continued to expand this footprint, bringing our highly competitive nationally-branded and easy to quote and sell bundled offering to leading agencies across the country. \n Beyond gaining share of the currently bundled independent agent market, close to $100 billion of Robinsons premium is distributed through captive or exclusive agencies. And this is despite lacking the superior consumer value proposition that results from carrier choice or depth that is available through independent agents. \n As a leading nationally-branded auto and home carrier, we believe we are well positioned to continue to both capture share of the existing bundled independent agent market, while also capitalizing on the ongoing shift from captive agents into the independent agent and direct channels. \n Despite the majority of Robinsons business being sold through agents today, more than 30% of total auto insurance is sold direct. And we believe as younger auto consumers go through the life events that increase the complexity of their household insurance needs, having broadly available online property insurance will become increasingly important to meet the needs of these future customers. \n Property risks are complex. No two homes are alike. They don't come with VINs, and as such, property insurance products have historically been built to be sold through agents. Homeowners, especially first-time home buyers, often struggle to identify important property characteristics like roof shape, shingle type, plumbing type, et cetera. And as such, most property products don't easily translate to online or mobile direct-to-consumer quoting and binding. We continue to invest to make it easier for consumers to quote and buy property insurance online through our multi-carrier HomeQuote Explorer platform.  \n This proprietary system guide shoppers through the home coverage interview, leveraging data fill and imagery to simplify the quoting process and deliver a multi-carrier shopping experience. This investment is paying off as we continue to lead the industry in desktop homeowner quote initiations. \n Additionally, while getting shoppers through the quoting process is half the battle, forcing online shoppers to go off-line and call to complete their sale is an antiquated and poor customer experience. And we've been investing to add online buy button functionality to the Progressive Home Direct property offering with availability now approaching 40 states. \n Recognizing the market opportunity ahead of us and the critical role that broadly available and competitively-priced property products play in our future success, let's transition over to Dave Pratt for an update on progress with our property product development and exposure management initiatives. \nDavid Pratt: Thanks, Pat. I'll review the results in the property insurance business that's underwritten by Progressive, and then talk about the changes we're implementing to position this business for future growth and consistent profitability. \n Pat described the huge market opportunity presented by the Robinson bundled customers. Since Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, we have invested to leverage Progressive's brand and distribution channels to attract and retain Robinson customers. We have rebranded ASI's Progressive Home, expanded the Platinum agent program and built online quoting and buying capabilities, as Pat just described. These investments have helped us more than double the size of this business reaching $2.2 billion in direct written premium last year. We're now the 10th largest homeowners insurer in the United States. \n While we're happy with the growth of the property business, we are not satisfied with its profitability. We've seen a consistent pattern over the last 5 years. Our underwriting expenses and non-weather losses have been consistent with our forecasts but weather losses have been much higher than the estimates that we included in our pricing decisions. \n In order to diagnose how to address this problem, we'll look at our performance relative to the overall property insurance market. I'll provide an overview of our countrywide performance and then highlight a state case study, focusing on the actions we've taken in Texas. \n When Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, 64% of the company's homeowners premium came from Florida, Texas and Louisiana. We have labeled those as legacy CAT states in the map here. Growth in other states has reduced that legacy CAT mix from 64% to 41% in 2021 direct written premium. But that's still a much heavier mix than the 22% that these states represent of the overall U.S. homeowners insurance market.  \n The challenges facing the Florida property market have been especially painful for Progressive since it represents almost 1/4 of our homeowners premium. Our Florida direct loss ratio over the last 5 years is 4 points better than the overall industry. But at 74.5%, it's still much higher than our target for the state. \n We have grouped the remaining states based on their exposure to volatile weather perils. The yellow states in the center of the country experienced significant hail losses. Our mix of business in those states is consistent with their share of the total industry premium.  \n The red states labeled moderate volatility are exposed to hurricane risk on the East Coast and wildfires in California, but there are less risky areas inland and away from the areas of the high wildfire risk. Progressive was a new entrant in the California market in 2016 so our mix of business in the moderate volatility states is less than their share of the overall industry. \n That leaves the less volatile states in green. As you can see, these more stable markets represented only 27% of our direct written premium last year, much lower than their 40% of total U.S. homeowners premium. In order to build a more stable homeowners book of business, we will limit growth in the volatile states and work to grow our share of premium in the less volatile markets. \n You've seen this growth and profitability chart in the past for our auto insurance business. It shows combined ratio on the X-axis and premium growth in the Y-axis. Each dot represents one of the top 10 insurers with the industry total represented by the black dot. We want to be in the upper right quadrant, representing profitable growth. \n Over the 5 years from 2017 through 2021, the U.S. homeowners insurance market grew at a 5% annual rate and suffered a combined ratio over 100. As we noted earlier, we're happy with Progressive's growth over that period, but we're certainly not satisfied with our position on the profitability axis. \n I talked before about our heavier than industry mix of business in the legacy CAT states. If we adjust Progressive's results by weighting our state level results using the industry's mix of premium by state, our combined ratio would match the industry. \n Let's take one more look at our results over the last 5 years before moving on to our plans for shifting the mix to less volatile states. This chart shows our 2017 through 2021 direct homeowners loss ratio for the groups of states described earlier. As you'd expect from the mix adjusted comparison of our results against the industry on the last page, our loss ratios are close to industry results within each group of states. This has been a difficult period for the industry in states with significant exposure to catastrophic weather and our relatively high mix of business in those states has driven our overall property results to be worse than the industry. \n I should note that California accounts for 45% of total industry homeowners premium in the states that we've labeled moderate volatility. But California is less than 20% of Progressive's premium from those states. While I'm happy to say that our loss ratio was better than the industry in 5 of those 6 states, our relatively low exposure to California's wildfires in 2017 and 2018, exaggerates our relative performance advantage for this group of states. \n It's encouraging to see that Progressive's loss ratio is very close to the industry average in the less volatile states since we have relatively little experience operating in these markets. We hope to see our relative performance improve as we roll out product model improvements. These regional comparisons simply reinforce the point that we need to shift our mix of business to build a property book that is consistently profitable. \n I'll talk next about the actions we're taking to accomplish that shift. As Tricia mentioned in her first quarter letter to shareholders, we have begun implementing a plan to shrink our business in Florida and limit growth in the other states with significant exposure to catastrophes. We've taken a number of actions in these states. We've increased rates, particularly for homes with older roofs; we've expanded underwriting eligibility restrictions to ensure that we're writing only business we expect to be profitable; we've introduced targeted nonrenewals in areas with concentrations of risk or segments that are unprofitable; we've introduced cost-sharing initiatives such as higher deductibles and actual cash value coverage on roofs that are nearing the end of their useful lives; and we've improved agency management, including a reduction in our agency force in select markets. \n While these changes are important, they're not sufficient. We can't shrink our way to success. So we also need to continue investing in product improvements that will support growth in the less volatile states. \n Over the last 4 years, we've made significant investments to develop the organizational capability to build and deliver best-in-class property insurance products. As you can see in the graph on the right, our product teams have grown from just 21 people in September of 2018 to 134 people at the end of this year's second quarter. We have added auto-like capabilities to a team with significant amount of property experience and expertise. I'll briefly describe the new teams that we've added in the product area. \n In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced an underwriting analytics team created to advance the science of underwriting and improve our risk selection. In the fourth quarter of that year, we introduced a dedicated research and development organization to focus on product model development and segmentation improvements. In the first quarter of 2019, we introduced a dedicated pricing team. And finally, in the second quarter of last year, we introduced a new rate revision and product delivery team to improve our speed to market so that we can take these new model enhancements and roll them out more quickly. These investments have helped us to improve our product offerings with more improvements still to come. \n In 2019, I described our 4.0 property product, which added new coverage features and expanded eligibility to meet the expectations of preferred agencies outside of our legacy CAT states. We have since introduced the 4.1 product model, which allowed us to price the water peril more accurately. These 2 product versions are now live in 41 states that represent 93% of our non-Florida premium. \n We'll move to full by-peril rating with the 5.0 product model. We've completed the research work for this new model and IT development work is in process now. The first state is scheduled to go live during the first half of 2023. We expect 5.0 to offer more competitive rates for a majority of shoppers and allow us to further expand the range of risks that we can accept. We will need these improvements to achieve our growth ambitions in the less volatile states. \n Now let's look at a case study for how these product improvements can help us improve results. In 2017, our Texas business was too concentrated in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with that region representing 40% of our Texas business compared with roughly 20% of the single-family homes in the state. We also had too many customers with low wind/hail deductibles, especially in the northern half of Texas that experiences frequent hailstorms. Our customers are often encouraged to file claims after these storms by aggressive marketing from roofers. \n While a free roof initially sounds appealing, we found that customers with higher deductibles are less likely to file a claim for minor damage. In order to address these problems, our Texas product manager increased rates, introduced higher deductible requirements for new customers, and improved price segmentation with the introduction of the 4.0 and then 4.1 product models. We have seen significant shifts in our Texas book of business as a result. \n The Dallas-Fort Worth mix is now in line with that area's share of homes in the state, our average wind/hail deductible is up 50% and we're attracting more bundled customers and fewer customers with roofs that are nearing the end of their useful life. These changes have resulted in improved performance relative to our competitors in Texas. \n In 2018 and 2019, our Texas combined ratio was 10 points worse than the industry. As we've shifted the mix of business, we started to see improvement in 2020 and our 2021 combined ratio was 15 points better than the overall industry in Texas. We were able to accomplish these shifts without shrinking the total business in the state. \n We now expect to achieve our target profit margins over time or in an average year, but it's important to note that Texas homeowners results are naturally volatile due to the state's exposure to big hurricane and hail events. That's why we have decided to limit growth in Texas as part of our overall plan to shift our mix to less volatile states. Texas is now well positioned for profitable growth but we wanted to represent a smaller share of our total property premium over time. \n I'll close with 2 topics that many of you have asked about. The first is the effect of inflation on our Property business. The table on the left on this page shows our filed rate changes over the last 2.5 years in our core homeowners product. But that table doesn't fully explain the changes in ultimate premiums that our renewing customers experience. \n Let me explain that process in a little more detail. When we sell a new homeowners insurance policy, we estimate the cost to replace the home in the event of a total loss. We insist that the agent insure the property for at least that amount to ensure adequate coverage for the customer. We update this replacement cost at every renewal event. If the estimated replacement cost has gone up, we automatically increase the coverage limit to maintain adequate coverage. \n Until recently, these renewal adjustments typically increase coverage limits by 2% or 3% at each policy renewal. The blue line in the chart on the right shows the average year-over-year change in these coverage limits by quarter. And you'll see that inflation-driven cost increases during the second half of last year jumped from the traditional 2% to 3% to double-digit increases in average coverage limits. \n The orange line shows the average renewal premium increase paid by customers who renewed with us in each quarter. So that orange line is a function not only of our filed rate change, but also the increases in coverage limit to ensure adequate coverage. And then any mix changes that might have resulted from some segments of customers renewing with us at a higher or lower rate as we've changed our product over time. \n While we would certainly prefer to keep prices more stable for our customers, this automatic adjustment to maintain appropriate coverage helps us to maintain appropriate rate levels to compensate for increases in claims severity. \n And finally, I'll provide a brief update on our reinsurance program. We use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital in the event of an unusually severe catastrophic event in addition to protecting against unusually volatile property results. Progressive is a large and consistent purchaser of coverage using both traditional reinsurance and ILS markets. We've developed long-term trading relationships with our reinsurance providers, and we strive to keep them well informed about our business results and plans. \n We currently retain the first $200 million in loss from a single catastrophe event with reinsurance coverage available above that amount up to a limit of $2.6 billion for a single Florida hurricane. We also have $175 million in coverage available for aggregate losses from 2022 catastrophe events in excess of $575 million. While the total coverage limit and per event retention will continue to evolve to fit the growth of our business, we expect to remain a consistent purchaser of reinsurance coverage. Consistent with this history, we were able to fully place our desired coverage at both the January 1 and June 1 renewal events. \n So let me summarize briefly before we take your questions. As Pat described earlier, a competitive property insurance product is required for Progressive to attract and retain bundled auto and home customers. And this segment represents a huge growth opportunity for Progressive. \n In the direct channel, our multi-carrier property agency and market-leading quote volume, are driving success. We're investing to improve the profitability in our underwritten property business to support continued Robinson growth in the independent agency channel. Through rate increases, coverage limitations and underwriting eligibility restrictions, we have improved results relative to our competitors. \n Best-in-class product design will support growth in the less volatile states, while a reduction in our Florida exposure and growth limits in our other states exposed to volatile catastrophe risk will reduce the volatility of our overall property, results, and we will continue to use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital from extreme events. \n Thanks again for joining us this morning. We'll now begin our live question-and-answer session. \nDouglas Constantine: This concludes the previous recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Pat Callahan and Dave Pratt, who can answer questions about the property presentation. [Operator Instructions]\n Please note, we have uploaded new PDFs of the presentation, which include all maps and match the webcast feed. These can be pulled from the webcast window and the supporting materials tab in the upper right corner. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n We will now take our first question. \nOperator: And our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on Personal Auto. So you guys echoed what you said last quarter that the rates are where you need to be in the majority of states, but we haven't really started to see your advertising pick up when you look at the expense ratio that was reported over the quarter. So can you just kind of explain how you're balancing advertising and a return to growth relative to where you are on the pricing side of things? \nSusan Griffith: Absolutely, Elyse. I think the headline for our private passenger auto is we think trends are encouraging, and it's playing out as we had hoped. So like we said, we had the majority of the rates behind us with a caveat of a few larger states. If you look at the 10-Q, our direct prospects are up 5% this quarter. They were down 11% last quarter, and that is with the spend down 7%, as you've identified. So we're spending less per new prospect with a ton of upside because we still don't have local media on in 19 states. That was 26 states in April. We continue to be able to open up with local advertising. \n So said another way, competitors are less aggressive due to their profitability challenges. We've seen that play out with some of the Qs that have been reported. And that allows us to acquire leads at a more efficient rate. So we'll continue to spend to get more, but we won't spend unnecessarily to create more business. I think -- I don't usually talk about 1 month in a quarter but I think it's important to know that the prospect volume in June of 2022 was our largest June ever. So we're pretty pleased about incoming volume and excited about continuing that, of course, with the caveat of all things that could happen with -- in this last couple of years. \n I think another way to look at it in terms of are we positioned well, and this might be a little bit further afield of your question, but we want to look at average written premium. So if you look at average written premium over 2021, it was 0. In 20 -- in first quarter, it was up about 6%, second quarter up about 11%. So those are written numbers and on average, take 4-ish months to earn in or hit the denominator for the combined ratio. \n The numerator is increasing about 7% to 8% based on frequency and severity changes that we've posted. And so right now, with the exception of a couple of states where we need a fair amount of rate, we believe we'll be able to take modest rate increases. We've talked in the past, with the exception of this year, about taking small bites of the apple. We'd like to get into that because we know that our customers want stable rates. So we feel good about our position. \n I also feel really great about our continued investment in segmentation. So about 65% of our countrywide premium are on 87. We just rolled out a new product model, 88 in Iowa, and we'll have more information on that. But overall, we feel great. We'll advertise more and open up more local markets as we feel necessary when we have the right rate. And of course, each state is different. But we feel pretty bullish. \nElyse Greenspan: And maybe a follow-up to that. You just mentioned modest rate increases from here. When you make that comment, like what are you assuming going forward for severity? How things will trend relative to what we've seen through the first half of the year? And I know frequency, right, was negative in the second quarter, and there was a benefit you guys called out from gas prices. So how are you thinking about severity and frequency from here when you make the comment that you only expect to need to take modest rate increases? \nSusan Griffith: Well, frequency was down about 8%. We're going to continue to watch that. We also look at vehicle miles traveled. And March through May, it was down about 12%. In June and through July, we're seeing it down a little bit more. We're not quite certain of all the reasons behind it. We believe gas prices might be a little bit of that. Gas prices are fairly inelastic. And we also know through surveys that maybe 15% to 20% of the population are still pretty nervous about going out and about. So they still are fearful of COVID and rightly so. So we look at that. \n And I think what I'm watching closely, and I don't know that we'll know for a couple of quarters, is how work from home settles in. So I know that -- I talked to a lot of my peers in other industries and there's a lot less people coming in. And could that change after the summer? We don't know. So we're going to watch those 3 things, to look at vehicle, miles traveled and frequency. So I'm going to more watch on those. \n As far as severity, we look at the Manheim Index for used car prices. That's ticked down a teeny bit, but still at all-time high. So we'll continue to watch that as well as sort of secondary and tertiary things like labor cost in body shops. If techs are making more and if there is less of a supply of people fixing those cars, we know that rentals could extend longer. So again, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen from the severity trends. But we do obviously account for every single data point as we continue to go. And we look at -- when we're looking at our increases, we bake that in. Do you guys want to add anything to that? You good? Does that answer your question, Elyse? \nElyse Greenspan: Yes. That does. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Phillips: Two questions on the Home side, both kind of longer-term questions. I guess, first on the distribution of homeowners, you went through the 3, kind of, captive, independent, direct. You didn't mention this, and maybe that's the answer is, do you see any growth opportunities through, I guess, what I'll call, institutional kind of clients or mortgage service providers, homeowners and things like that for kind of longer-term growth in homeowners? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I would say we'd look for any kind of growth. So I know that we've talked -- we've worked with construction builders before. And we've talked about mortgage companies. We've had actually some tests and things that we've done with some mortgage companies, Rocket Mortgage as an example. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that, Pat? \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. I mean I think the embedded insurance into transactions or life events where people are acquiring the underlying asset, be it in auto, be it a boat, motorcycle, RV or be it a home, presents a shopping opportunity where we absolutely want to position our products to both facilitate the transaction by ensuring the collateral can transfer and be protected provided it's got some outstanding loan or paper on it. But we are starting to work more with, as you mentioned, digital lenders as well as more traditional lenders through independent agents. So it is a growth opportunity for us, and we are constantly looking at how to position our products best, where consumers want them, need them and, frankly, are shopping for them so we can participate in those transactions. \nMichael Phillips: Okay. Perfect. And then second one, again, kind of longer term on homeowners. In Auto, your Snapshot and Telematics have kind of been all the rage and how that could change the pricing in Auto. Longer term, is there kind of an analogy for that in homeowners? It's something to come and make pricing more accurate that companies could start talking about at some point? It sort of analogies to how we drive our car. \nSusan Griffith: Yes, I think there are several analogies. Obviously, the ones that Dave talked about was age of roof, et cetera. But water damage is a lot. So if you can have systems in place that alert you to something if you're out of the home, there's water damage. So we look at all of those things in terms of let's think water damage, think of security systems, think of number of people in the household. So I think there's a lot of related items that we've looked at in the past several years and we'll continue to look at to understand kind of that same rate to risk in home as we have in our auto product. \nOperator: And our next question will come from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. \nDavid Motemaden: Tricia, you had said that you don't have local media turned on in 19 states in June. That was down versus 26 states in April. Just wondering how much premium do those 19 states represent where you don't have the local media advertising turned on? And could you just talk about how far away you are from turning those on? What sort of metrics you're looking at? And I guess really just wondering how far away you are from turning those on. \nSusan Griffith: Yes, each state is a little different animal, and it really depends on when we got the rate that we needed and when it's earning in and when we feel comfortable that we want to grow and grow profitably. So although we wouldn't share the aggregate premium or the states really necessarily for that matter, we'll continue to assess that channel by channel, state by state as we get the rate that we need in order to be adequate. \nJohn Sauerland: We can tell you it's well known that there are a few key states where we cannot get rate, and those are significant states. So it's not a small percentage of the U.S. households that is not getting the local media from us. So it's a definite upside for us once we get rate adequate in those states. \nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then if I just look at the severity, up 16% year-over-year this quarter, and I understand BI as a part of that. But I'm just wondering if you can maybe just break out how much of that up 16% is being driven by used car prices specifically? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. A significant part is driven by car prices, total losses, cost to repair. And I talked a little bit about the other parts of that, that go along with that. So parts prices are up around 5%, labor rates are up around 3% and our rental cars are up between 0.5% and 1%. So all those inclusive. A lot of it has to do with car prices, both from a total loss perspective and a used car perspective. And obviously, if the used car prices are up and they're up significantly since pre-COVID, many of those won't be totaled, and the repairs become more expensive. \nJohn Sauerland: A rough estimate for the impact of vehicle valuation on severity across our physical damage lines is around half. So that's not exactly the cars, but as a walking around number, it's pretty close. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. And severity is up 16% overall, but up in the 20-ish percent rate in both collision and PD. Thank you. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Yaron Kinar of Jefferies. \nYaron Kinar: I want to turn back to the homeowners business for a second and maybe tying it to the Robinson. So in the presentation, it kind of show Robinsons making up about 11% of your overall book. Is that generally consistent across the country? Or is the weighting of Robinsons greater in the Southeast and the more volatile states? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, I would say the weighting of Robinsons are greater in the states that we've grown in more historically from ASI, from ARX. And that's also one of the reasons why we want to be able to expand through the country, not just to derisk the portfolio but to growing Robinsons, which is why we will likely add more Platinum agents in those states and reduce Platinum agents in the states we've had before. Do you want to add anything, Pat? \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. No. I think that's the primary driver, right? We've been in the auto business for 85 years. We've been expanding our property business over the last 5 to 10 to get to the 47% where we write today. So there's still a mismatch between kind of how long we've been in the market and how long we frankly had competitive property offerings to bundle with our auto offerings. \nJohn Sauerland: And just for clarity there, that 11% includes our customers that are bundled with third-party carriers. So we started offering bundles in our direct channel well before the agency penetration, which we achieved with, again, ASI, ARX. So the distribution of the home is a little more aligned with countrywide because of the footprint of our direct business was obviously countrywide from the inception of direct, and we had homeowner coverage pretty much across the country on the direct side, caveating. Of course, there are a few markets that are troublesome for all carriers. So it's a little tighter there. But generally, we're pretty well distributed for Robinsons on the direct side, a little more concentrated on the agency side. \nYaron Kinar: That's helpful clarification. And I guess my follow-up to that would be then on the goodwill impairment. Is that purely a function of higher-than-expected loss ratio? Or is it also a function of in reaction to that loss ratio slowing down growth in those more volatile states? And I guess what I'm trying to get to also with this question is, I'm assuming that as you're looking to grow in the less volatile states, you're going to encounter separate competition from national carriers that were probably less interested in penetrating the Southeast and in the volatile states. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think I'll start with the latter part of your question. Yes, I think the competition will be greater in those states. The goodwill impairment was based on just the significant catastrophic losses that we've had. And when we purchased ARX, we had certain assumptions on combined ratios. And of course, we have a CAT load. It's far surpassed that, as Dave talked about. So it was that. When we -- we periodically look at goodwill. When we looked at it, we took into account the severe catastrophes where we're concentrated as well as just some recent legislation in Florida.\n As you know, we wanted to not renew about 60,000 policies. There's some new legislation that requires us or where we'll ask our customers if they had a new roof or the life of a roof is at least 5 years, we will renew them, which will be good because that means they've got a new roof and it's something we'd want to write. But we -- so we're not sure exactly how many of those 60,000 we will not renew. We took that into account when we were looking at the impairment. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Kligerman, Credit Suisse. \nAndrew Kligerman: Starting with the bundling in the Robinsons channel. Independent agents, just by their nature, have relationships with numerous carriers. And so my question is, how does Progressive break into that bundling effort? Maybe tying in pricing into the equation, do you have to provide a significant discount? And could you give a little color around that? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean one of the reasons we purchased ARX was to have access to those bundled customers in the independent agent channel. We know independent agents love our service, love our ability to handle claims well. But what would happen is they would have to write with someone else that they wanted to bundle. So that was a big effort. We are very broadly distributed in our independent agent channel, have over 40,000 independent agents. So what we did was really try to have a few -- or more of a scarcity model on the Platinum program with certain agents, that we wanted to have them write the Robinsons, our auto home bundle, be the #1, 2 or 3 carrier in their firm. So that's sort of how we look at that. \n We also then had to make some changes, whether it was compensation changes in the form of higher commissions as well as writing 12-month auto policies to align with those 12-month home policies. So there's about 4,000 Platinum agents across the country. We work well with them. They consider us very preferred in their firms, and that's why we want to make sure that we're adequately priced on both auto and home to continue to grow with those agents.  \n In fact, I was just with -- we have an agency council that we had an outgoing group and an incoming group, and we talked a lot about efforts to grow, and I'm bullish about being able to do that obviously in the right venues. \nAndrew Kligerman: So attrition, discounting -- material discounts. And any color on that part of the equation? \nSusan Griffith: Well, we rate to have our target profit margin. You get a multi-product discount with the -- when you have multi-products. But we don't -- I don't know that we ever really talk specifically about those amounts. \nPatrick Callahan: No. To win in the agency channel, we have to have a viable value proposition for both the clients of the agency and for the agents themselves. So on the client side, we have to have competitive and stable pricing, we have to have a quality product and we have to have really competitive pricing. And that's where, as Dave mentioned, we've got work to do to expand the perils that we write, improve the segmentation and, frankly, just have more competitive pricing for the agent's clients. \n And then on the agent side, we have to have great ease of use and competitive compensation for the effort it takes to write a policy with Progressive. And that's where, as Tricia mentioned, the Platinum program has competitive offering of compensation for our agents that pays more based on how much and what quality of business or type of business they're placing with us over time. \n And then we're known for ease of use through great systems and technology over many, many years. So not explicitly buying market share or, as you said, buying shelf space for a proxy. We are competing based on a quality of a competitive product for the clients in the agency channel and our value proposition for the agents who sell it. \nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. Very, very helpful. And then just with regard to the auto side. Non-rate actions this quarter, any color that you could provide around that magnitude? What types of non-rate actions you've been taking and plan to take? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, it's really dependent on each state. So in some states, we've had some underwriting and bill plan restrictions. Obviously, an easier way to go is what I've talked about in terms of turning local media off. And those are, for the most part, what we use to try to stall growth a little bit when we don't have adequate rates. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: In the prepared presentation, you made a comment that the average PLE of a Robinson was up 3x that of a Sam. I remember from a presentation maybe in 2013 or 2014, you made the comment that the lifetime value of a Robinson was probably 4x to 5x that of a Sam. You've had a decade of experience now. And obviously, in this period of time, you've seen in disruptive pricing, how quickly the Sams leave and the Robinsons stay. Can you talk about that PLE statistic versus the lifetime value statistic? It would suggest there's a multiplier to lifetime value, maybe there's ticket size or maybe you've updated your thoughts on the value proposition of the different segments? \nJohn Sauerland: Sure. The lifetime value calculation would include not only the PLE difference but the average premium difference. So we target common margins across segments of the business. So for -- across the auto program, we're targeting similar margins, but different segments have different average premiums as well as policy life expectancy and you sort of multiply those together, and that's how you come to a bigger lifetime value. \nJoshua Shanker: And that 4 to 5 is still probably close to accurate? \nJohn Sauerland: That's -- probably. \nSusan Griffith: I think, generally, we have to look -- we have to go back and look at the specific math, but I would say probably generally. \nJoshua Shanker: All right. And thinking about the next couple of years and looking back to maybe '16, '17, '18, can we talk about the efficacy of a national ad campaign strategy versus targeted paid search spend and whatnot. At the early stages, when your pricing is adequate and the rest of the market pricing is still trying to play catch up, what does that mean for the marketing strategy? Do you need to spend to get customers to come to Progressive? Or is there a period where the customers elect to come because of your brand recognition and whatnot, where the acquisition costs are lower in the early stages of a hard market? \nSusan Griffith: I think you do a little bit of both. I mean I think a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing. So I talked -- when Elyse asked the question, I talked about efficiently acquiring leads has to do with the competition in the digital space. So we -- the national brand is really important. It is one of our pillars -- our strategic pillars. So we want to be the brand that talks about savings protection. We want to be known that gives consideration. We want to be on the short list.\n And then the local marketing really through most of online search. That's a nice lever to be able to turn off and on when we want to grow. But again, that's very dependent on supply and demand and what's happening in the industry with our competition. So I feel like we're in a good position now. Again, we have some states we want to turn on. John talked about a couple of large states we'd love to get adequate rates in so we can continue to grow. But we feel like we're in a good position. We have some levers, and we've had a tremendous amount of growth in the last 5 years.\n In fact, we've added 7 million PIFs and grown Auto PIFs 70%. So -- and that was coming off the last hard market. I'm not going to say that we're going to grow that same amount in the next couple of years, but that's always been our playbook to position ourselves, to get out ahead of rate, have a lot of different levers on marketing and then move as quickly as we can. \nJohn Sauerland: Josh, if I might add a little bit there. I think that's a great question. And I think the answer is plays to our strengths. So if you look at the percentage of folks coming to shop at Progressive that we would attribute to mass media from the kind of the time frame that you talked about to today, it has shifted a lot to much more specifically attributable media and we are great at analyzing the data fairly real time and making decisions very quickly to be able to redeploy dollars to go to the most effective way of bringing people in.\n So I think it's because of technology and the data available increasingly in a real-time basis that is allowing us to get more and more of our media spend really, really effective. Mass media, as Tricia mentioned and our brand are obviously the first step that's crucial to have that brand awareness, but then the agility and the data and analysis that goes into really targeting, again, I think, plays to our strengths and has allowed us to continue to grow advertising spend and be super efficient. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. I didn't hear my full name. My first question, 2 quarters ago, you were telling me you have a first -- when you have a first-party total loss collision, you're going to pay that immediately. So you'll recognize the elevated cost of new and used cars in real time. But on a third-party perspective, there's often a delay in subrogation. Can you provide an update on the life cycle of claims? How you feel about the strength of reserves for claims that you were notified last year that may only be settling now? And I guess, ultimately, I'm just trying to understand if you think Auto is becoming more of a medium tail line these days from short tail? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, I would say it's still a short tail. I think in the last couple of years, when you look at the data on subrogation from a property damage, whether it's incoming or outbound, there's been delays for many different reasons. And probably more recently, in the last couple of quarters has been on staffing. You've looked at the unemployment rate, and I know myself, along with many of my peers have wanted to really get ahead of staffing, and it's been a little bit more challenging.\n Personally at Progressive, we feel like we're in a really good position right now. I wouldn't necessarily have said that a couple of quarters ago. So the timing depends on when you're able to settle that claim and then, of course, get the paperwork to the other company and of course, for us, either we're paying out to them or they're paying out to us. So I think it's still short tail. I think that will -- hopefully, we expect it will level out at some point when staffing is normalized across the industry, and we get back to sort of claims as usual.\n I will say that, that is an important piece because anytime that you can get salvage or subrogation settled more timely, that hits the bottom line. In fact, I was talking to our claims President a few weeks ago, and we feel like we are very adequately staffed in claims, and we're actually going to move some people over to subrogation and salvage towards -- in the near future until the end of the year to get some of those closed in a more timely fashion. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. So can I infer from your comments on staffing that you feel good about the strength of your reserves or claims that you were notified last year only settling now? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, I feel very comfortable. Gary, you can comment on this. We have our head of actuary here. But I feel very good about our strength of reserves. To date, we're about 0.6 points on the CRM favorable. We were favorable in this quarter, and we feel really good. And part of our reserving that we look into, and Gary, you can talk about this, is we have a robust role forward process where we take into account in existing and new features, inflationary factors. \nGary Traicoff: Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Yes. So good question. To Tricia's point, overall, we feel very good about our reserves, right? Our goal is always adequate reserves, with minimal variation and our philosophy has been very consistent over the long term. We have developed unfavorably year-to-date, about 0.6 points on the combined ratio; Personal Auto, about 0.3 point; and Commercial, about 2%. That's in line with where we've been in the past at midyear. And if you look historically, we've ended the year generally within 0.1 or 0.2 points.\n To Tricia's point -- and we do have a paper that we publish on our investor site, so you could read more detail about our methodology. But we will look at about 25% or a little bit over 25% of the reserves monthly. And then on the other 75%, we have an inflation factor that we apply. So if any new features come in or existing features, they automatically go up with inflation based off severity.\n As features age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, we have automatic adjustments for those. So we feel that we've kept up very well with the rising costs. And to your point, Tracy, we have seen somewhat of a slowdown relative to closing claims compared to the past, just with everything going on over the last couple of years. But because of that mechanism we have that we can adjust as they age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, naturally, we've been able to keep up just as we would have intended. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: That's great color. Also one of your large competitors is no longer selling auto insurance in California. So I was wondering what your appetite is these days to write business in California. \nSusan Griffith: We would love to write more business in California. It is the most populous state. Unfortunately, right now, we don't -- we aren't able to get adequate rates. And once we're able to do that, we are open for business and we'll write as much as we can. Right now, there's about 30 auto programs representing close to half the California market that have rate increases pending. We have 1 pending in one of our auto programs from January, we'll likely have at least another one in the near future.\n So if we can get the rate that we need to be adequately rated, we want to write all the business we can. The moratorium on rate increases in California is unfortunate because we don't think it serves the consumers of California, and you only have a couple of things to do. And there's a couple of levers that we talked about, and we'll use those tactics to slow growth, but we want to be a part of the future California market, and we'll do what we can to get there. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: So when you mentioned that it doesn't serve California consumer as well, could you envision a full market growing in California for auto? Is it -- if auto really becomes unavailable? \nSusan Griffith: What? I'm sorry, what -- could you repeat your question? I didn't hear that. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Yes. You were saying that the rules there don't really serve consumers well. And if there is lack of appetite by auto insurers to write business in California, do you think there would be a residual market created, let's say workers comp? \nSusan Griffith: Got it. Got it. Okay. \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. It may not -- we've seen residual markets come and go in various states over many decades. And as you note, generally, when there's not a willing voluntary private market participation, there has to be a backstop given the mandatory insurance requirements. So could there be growth of a residual market in California? Absolutely. And there, it's up to the regulator to decide if that's a path that they want to go down.\n I think we've seen historically states like New York, where it grew rapidly. And then with voluntary participation, there was better options, more competition and consumers benefit when there's availability that brings competition that drives affordability. And carriers compete on both price and service whereas the backstop residual markets, unfortunately, typically provide a minimum level of both. So is it possible? Absolutely. Is there precedent? Yes, we've seen markets where voluntary participation shrinks and residual markets grow. And therefore, it could happen in California. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. \nRyan Tunis: Tricia, first question, I think I heard you make the comment that you won't say you'll grow the next 2 years like you did 5 years after the last hard market we had in 2016. When we think about the mid-teens type of PIF growth you had coming out of that last hard market, could you just kind of compare this hard market to that? Like what are some of the relative challenges? \nSusan Griffith: Well, I think -- and my point, Ryan, was more of it's a really big ship now. So it's a much bigger ship than it was back in 2016. So as a percentage basis, growth growing 70% in Auto is going to be tough. The bottom line is we will grow as fast as we possibly can at or below our target profit margins. And that's what we're going to do as the hard market continues. It's sort of hard to foreshadow what will happen right now because I feel like we're right in the midst of it. And we have the rate that we're earning in, yet to earn in and more advertising to open up and then, of course, a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing.\n So the reason for saying that was just that we have grown a tremendous amount and just any company when you get the size of us, it's harder to grow as quickly on a percentage basis. \nRyan Tunis: Makes sense. And then I guess my follow-up is just trying to figure out what I'm missing on thinking about some of the rate adequacy comments. So it sounds like you've got about 7 points of rate earn in and out and you feel like you're done with -- you still feel like you're done in most of the big actions you have to take. But I think you mentioned that repair cost is still adding 3 to 5 points. Frequency is, I think, 8 points lower today than it was a year ago, and we're in a work from home environment then, too. So like is your rate adequacy comment all sort of backward looking? Or like have you started thinking a little bit about what do you think prospective loss trend might be in 2023? \nSusan Griffith: I mean we're always thinking about the future, but we got out ahead of rates. So if you think about 2021, we had about 8 points and most of that was in the second half. We have 9 points year-to-date with the 5 points earning in. So I feel -- that's why I said we may have modest rate increases. And again, there are a couple of states where we need a lot more rate, and that's on average. So when I talk about the 8 points, 9 points and the 5 yet to earn in, that is very different depending on different states, but on average. So that's where we feel good. Likely, we'll have to take some modest rate increases as we watch the trends, but we will do that as we see the trends unfold. \nRyan Tunis: And I guess my last one is just -- and it was a comment in the 10-Q about really focusing on retention, which makes sense given some of the PLE decline. But I was wondering if -- is there a strategy here where you feel it makes more sense to pass through a little bit less rate on the renewal book and maybe focus less on new business? Is that why you feel good about storing the 96% that the strategy is more sort of retention focused than new app focused at this point. I was just -- I just wanted to kind of clarify that comment in the Q. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. Yes our -- where we want to grow is PIF growth. And so that includes both the new and renewal business. And retention has always been our holy grail. You pay a lot to get a customer in and you want to keep them through stable rates and great service. Obviously, when you have to crank up rates a lot when trends change dramatically, you're going to lose people. So we knew that would happen. And -- but we want to keep everybody we can at or below our target margins for the renewal business. \n And then new business, obviously, we want to come in because we want to take advantage of a competitive market when others are raising rates after we've raised rates. So both are important. PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth, and that will take a longer time. New business is more precise, more day-to-day. PIF growth will take a little bit longer since we've had some degradation in PLE, and we're looking forward to starting to ramp up PIF growth. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Derek Han of KBW. \nDong Yoon Han: Just wanted to follow up on the last question. How should we think about the time frame for reaccelerating PIF growth, especially as you pull back in property? \nSusan Griffith: I think it will be a little bit different, likely in the different channels. And I don't want to signal exactly when we'll see it grow. A lot will depend on the caveats that we talked about with states opening up, media opening up and getting our rates stable. I don't want to signal that. I'll let you know as it unfolds. \nJohn Sauerland: I'll just offer. It's also very dependent upon the competitive market. So we've seen a few competitors report second quarter, combined with over 100. We have 1 competitor who is reporting their rate increases monthly. We see another place where in large markets, we see very mature competitors taking multiple double-digit increases in very short periods. So it's an environment that's pretty hard. And if competitors continue to take aggressive action, we're going to be able to get back to PIF growth much faster than if they don't, both obviously on the new side. But the retention is not only a function of our rate increases, it's relative to what our consumers can find out in the marketplace when they go shop and if competitors have all raised rates as well, then our retention will improve.\n So it's really difficult to project. I think all of our product managers are taking the right actions at the local level. And as we continue to note, if we can get rate adequate in some key markets, we'll be in even better position to grow. \nDong Yoon Han: Okay. That's really helpful. And then Tricia, when you say that most rate increases are behind you, does that mean rate filings or implemented rate changes or something else? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. It just means that the majority of the rate increases that we were able to get, again, the caveat with a couple of states, are on The Street. And then that's why I wanted to try to walk through a little bit about how we think about them earning in. And so when you have the rate, it's going to take some time to earn in. And we feel good about that we're in the heart of that and that we still have 5 more points to earn in as we speak. \nDong Yoon Han: Got it. And then if I could just squeeze in one last question. Does your Personal Auto pricing assume that currently elevated overall inflation rates are going to filter into the medical cost components? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. We look at inflation differently with medical and physical damage. But we see BI trends up a bit, general damages specifically with attorney-repped. And of course, we look at medical inflation as well when we look at our rates for each line coverage, whether it's medical payments or bodily injury. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Zaremski of BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: Great. First question, I'm curious, in light of your experience with ARX over the past years, when we think about Progressive's growth strategies in both on the commercial BOP side specifically, and I guess in home as well, has that experience change your view on M&A in terms of kind of large-scale ARX's all in over $1 billion. Does that change your view on kind of where M&A fits in accelerating those growth strategies? \nSusan Griffith: I think we always learn every time there's an acquisition, and we haven't been a big acquirer over the years, I think we've learned a lot of lessons. I think any new product that you go into, you learn. And so when we went on -- when we went direct, we didn't make money for quite some time because we were learning. We do the same with every new product. But I think -- I look at acquisitions more of is there some technology that we want? Is there some access we want? So ARX was access. Is this an easy way to continue our portfolio? So that's one of the reasons why we acquired Protective on the commercial line side because we knew we had the acumen to look at smaller fleets. They have medium to larger fleets. So that was something that was important to us as we grow into the fleet program. That's really how I look at it.\n I think acquisitions, if you don't do them very often, you're always going to learn a lot. One of the things that we have built since then is an area of the company where we look at M&A and we look at what we need in order to be successful in that. And that's within our strategy team. And so we're getting our arms much better around that. I think that's what ARX taught us is that you have to have probably a lot more investments early on in order to get your arms around the product. And we're doing that with Protective. I'm very excited about the Protective acquisition, where we're at. It was much different than ARX just as a learning and how we can leverage that much more quickly. \nMichael Zaremski: So I guess as a follow-up, Tricia. On the commercial BOP side, given you're entering a lot of new states and some new products, do you feel comfortable with your level of expertise? \nSusan Griffith: Not at this point. We'll get there. The first, we know -- first, wanted to create the BOP products, and we went really small. So if you think about small business, it's usually defined as 100 employees or less. We're at 20 employees or less. We're very, very surgical to understand that rate to risk and we wanted to expand it out to the states. So we're in 37 states. We're learning every day. As we learn more, just like we have in many parts of our commercial business, we'll be able to expand that. So we get more and more comfort every single day. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And my follow-up is pivoting to the -- to your presentation today. I think you mentioned over $1 billion of home premiums written on unaffiliated carrier balance sheets. Just curious, maybe you could shed some light on those partnerships. And just -- is some of that business in states you'd like to grow in and might be kind of up for grabs over time as you expand your appetite in certain states? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. We've had what we've called Progressive Advantage Agency for many, many years, and we continue to build a stable of carriers that can serve many different value of homes. And some of those are -- many of those are in places where we're going to grow. But the partnerships are really incredible, and they want to grow with us, and it's all about the right rate at the right time. So we continue to grow there. We've put it online with our HomeQuote Explorer, where we have a buy button in -- I forget how many states. \nJohn Sauerland: 38 for Progressive Home. \nSusan Griffith: 38 for Progressive Home. So yes, we continue to invest in there. It's nice to have the partners to work with. And again, we've always been about choice and we want to make sure if our rate isn't the best, that we have opportunities to be able to have our customers still bundle with Progressive Auto and those partnerships. \nDouglas Constantine: That appears to have been our final question. And so that concludes our event. Tonya, I'll hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts. \nOperator: Certainly. This concludes the Progressive Corporation's Second Quarter Investor Event. Information about the replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Pratt",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat. I'll review the results in the property insurance business that's underwritten by Progressive, and then talk about the changes we're implementing to position this business for future growth and consistent profitability. \n Pat described the huge market opportunity presented by the Robinson bundled customers. Since Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, we have invested to leverage Progressive's brand and distribution channels to attract and retain Robinson customers. We have rebranded ASI's Progressive Home, expanded the Platinum agent program and built online quoting and buying capabilities, as Pat just described. These investments have helped us more than double the size of this business reaching $2.2 billion in direct written premium last year. We're now the 10th largest homeowners insurer in the United States. \n While we're happy with the growth of the property business, we are not satisfied with its profitability. We've seen a consistent pattern over the last 5 years. Our underwriting expenses and non-weather losses have been consistent with our forecasts but weather losses have been much higher than the estimates that we included in our pricing decisions. \n In order to diagnose how to address this problem, we'll look at our performance relative to the overall property insurance market. I'll provide an overview of our countrywide performance and then highlight a state case study, focusing on the actions we've taken in Texas. \n When Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, 64% of the company's homeowners premium came from Florida, Texas and Louisiana. We have labeled those as legacy CAT states in the map here. Growth in other states has reduced that legacy CAT mix from 64% to 41% in 2021 direct written premium. But that's still a much heavier mix than the 22% that these states represent of the overall U.S. homeowners insurance market.  \n The challenges facing the Florida property market have been especially painful for Progressive since it represents almost 1/4 of our homeowners premium. Our Florida direct loss ratio over the last 5 years is 4 points better than the overall industry. But at 74.5%, it's still much higher than our target for the state. \n We have grouped the remaining states based on their exposure to volatile weather perils. The yellow states in the center of the country experienced significant hail losses. Our mix of business in those states is consistent with their share of the total industry premium.  \n The red states labeled moderate volatility are exposed to hurricane risk on the East Coast and wildfires in California, but there are less risky areas inland and away from the areas of the high wildfire risk. Progressive was a new entrant in the California market in 2016 so our mix of business in the moderate volatility states is less than their share of the overall industry. \n That leaves the less volatile states in green. As you can see, these more stable markets represented only 27% of our direct written premium last year, much lower than their 40% of total U.S. homeowners premium. In order to build a more stable homeowners book of business, we will limit growth in the volatile states and work to grow our share of premium in the less volatile markets. \n You've seen this growth and profitability chart in the past for our auto insurance business. It shows combined ratio on the X-axis and premium growth in the Y-axis. Each dot represents one of the top 10 insurers with the industry total represented by the black dot. We want to be in the upper right quadrant, representing profitable growth. \n Over the 5 years from 2017 through 2021, the U.S. homeowners insurance market grew at a 5% annual rate and suffered a combined ratio over 100. As we noted earlier, we're happy with Progressive's growth over that period, but we're certainly not satisfied with our position on the profitability axis. \n I talked before about our heavier than industry mix of business in the legacy CAT states. If we adjust Progressive's results by weighting our state level results using the industry's mix of premium by state, our combined ratio would match the industry. \n Let's take one more look at our results over the last 5 years before moving on to our plans for shifting the mix to less volatile states. This chart shows our 2017 through 2021 direct homeowners loss ratio for the groups of states described earlier. As you'd expect from the mix adjusted comparison of our results against the industry on the last page, our loss ratios are close to industry results within each group of states. This has been a difficult period for the industry in states with significant exposure to catastrophic weather and our relatively high mix of business in those states has driven our overall property results to be worse than the industry. \n I should note that California accounts for 45% of total industry homeowners premium in the states that we've labeled moderate volatility. But California is less than 20% of Progressive's premium from those states. While I'm happy to say that our loss ratio was better than the industry in 5 of those 6 states, our relatively low exposure to California's wildfires in 2017 and 2018, exaggerates our relative performance advantage for this group of states. \n It's encouraging to see that Progressive's loss ratio is very close to the industry average in the less volatile states since we have relatively little experience operating in these markets. We hope to see our relative performance improve as we roll out product model improvements. These regional comparisons simply reinforce the point that we need to shift our mix of business to build a property book that is consistently profitable. \n I'll talk next about the actions we're taking to accomplish that shift. As Tricia mentioned in her first quarter letter to shareholders, we have begun implementing a plan to shrink our business in Florida and limit growth in the other states with significant exposure to catastrophes. We've taken a number of actions in these states. We've increased rates, particularly for homes with older roofs; we've expanded underwriting eligibility restrictions to ensure that we're writing only business we expect to be profitable; we've introduced targeted nonrenewals in areas with concentrations of risk or segments that are unprofitable; we've introduced cost-sharing initiatives such as higher deductibles and actual cash value coverage on roofs that are nearing the end of their useful lives; and we've improved agency management, including a reduction in our agency force in select markets. \n While these changes are important, they're not sufficient. We can't shrink our way to success. So we also need to continue investing in product improvements that will support growth in the less volatile states. \n Over the last 4 years, we've made significant investments to develop the organizational capability to build and deliver best-in-class property insurance products. As you can see in the graph on the right, our product teams have grown from just 21 people in September of 2018 to 134 people at the end of this year's second quarter. We have added auto-like capabilities to a team with significant amount of property experience and expertise. I'll briefly describe the new teams that we've added in the product area. \n In the second quarter of 2018, we introduced an underwriting analytics team created to advance the science of underwriting and improve our risk selection. In the fourth quarter of that year, we introduced a dedicated research and development organization to focus on product model development and segmentation improvements. In the first quarter of 2019, we introduced a dedicated pricing team. And finally, in the second quarter of last year, we introduced a new rate revision and product delivery team to improve our speed to market so that we can take these new model enhancements and roll them out more quickly. These investments have helped us to improve our product offerings with more improvements still to come. \n In 2019, I described our 4.0 property product, which added new coverage features and expanded eligibility to meet the expectations of preferred agencies outside of our legacy CAT states. We have since introduced the 4.1 product model, which allowed us to price the water peril more accurately. These 2 product versions are now live in 41 states that represent 93% of our non-Florida premium. \n We'll move to full by-peril rating with the 5.0 product model. We've completed the research work for this new model and IT development work is in process now. The first state is scheduled to go live during the first half of 2023. We expect 5.0 to offer more competitive rates for a majority of shoppers and allow us to further expand the range of risks that we can accept. We will need these improvements to achieve our growth ambitions in the less volatile states. \n Now let's look at a case study for how these product improvements can help us improve results. In 2017, our Texas business was too concentrated in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with that region representing 40% of our Texas business compared with roughly 20% of the single-family homes in the state. We also had too many customers with low wind/hail deductibles, especially in the northern half of Texas that experiences frequent hailstorms. Our customers are often encouraged to file claims after these storms by aggressive marketing from roofers. \n While a free roof initially sounds appealing, we found that customers with higher deductibles are less likely to file a claim for minor damage. In order to address these problems, our Texas product manager increased rates, introduced higher deductible requirements for new customers, and improved price segmentation with the introduction of the 4.0 and then 4.1 product models. We have seen significant shifts in our Texas book of business as a result. \n The Dallas-Fort Worth mix is now in line with that area's share of homes in the state, our average wind/hail deductible is up 50% and we're attracting more bundled customers and fewer customers with roofs that are nearing the end of their useful life. These changes have resulted in improved performance relative to our competitors in Texas. \n In 2018 and 2019, our Texas combined ratio was 10 points worse than the industry. As we've shifted the mix of business, we started to see improvement in 2020 and our 2021 combined ratio was 15 points better than the overall industry in Texas. We were able to accomplish these shifts without shrinking the total business in the state. \n We now expect to achieve our target profit margins over time or in an average year, but it's important to note that Texas homeowners results are naturally volatile due to the state's exposure to big hurricane and hail events. That's why we have decided to limit growth in Texas as part of our overall plan to shift our mix to less volatile states. Texas is now well positioned for profitable growth but we wanted to represent a smaller share of our total property premium over time. \n I'll close with 2 topics that many of you have asked about. The first is the effect of inflation on our Property business. The table on the left on this page shows our filed rate changes over the last 2.5 years in our core homeowners product. But that table doesn't fully explain the changes in ultimate premiums that our renewing customers experience. \n Let me explain that process in a little more detail. When we sell a new homeowners insurance policy, we estimate the cost to replace the home in the event of a total loss. We insist that the agent insure the property for at least that amount to ensure adequate coverage for the customer. We update this replacement cost at every renewal event. If the estimated replacement cost has gone up, we automatically increase the coverage limit to maintain adequate coverage. \n Until recently, these renewal adjustments typically increase coverage limits by 2% or 3% at each policy renewal. The blue line in the chart on the right shows the average year-over-year change in these coverage limits by quarter. And you'll see that inflation-driven cost increases during the second half of last year jumped from the traditional 2% to 3% to double-digit increases in average coverage limits. \n The orange line shows the average renewal premium increase paid by customers who renewed with us in each quarter. So that orange line is a function not only of our filed rate change, but also the increases in coverage limit to ensure adequate coverage. And then any mix changes that might have resulted from some segments of customers renewing with us at a higher or lower rate as we've changed our product over time. \n While we would certainly prefer to keep prices more stable for our customers, this automatic adjustment to maintain appropriate coverage helps us to maintain appropriate rate levels to compensate for increases in claims severity. \n And finally, I'll provide a brief update on our reinsurance program. We use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital in the event of an unusually severe catastrophic event in addition to protecting against unusually volatile property results. Progressive is a large and consistent purchaser of coverage using both traditional reinsurance and ILS markets. We've developed long-term trading relationships with our reinsurance providers, and we strive to keep them well informed about our business results and plans. \n We currently retain the first $200 million in loss from a single catastrophe event with reinsurance coverage available above that amount up to a limit of $2.6 billion for a single Florida hurricane. We also have $175 million in coverage available for aggregate losses from 2022 catastrophe events in excess of $575 million. While the total coverage limit and per event retention will continue to evolve to fit the growth of our business, we expect to remain a consistent purchaser of reinsurance coverage. Consistent with this history, we were able to fully place our desired coverage at both the January 1 and June 1 renewal events. \n So let me summarize briefly before we take your questions. As Pat described earlier, a competitive property insurance product is required for Progressive to attract and retain bundled auto and home customers. And this segment represents a huge growth opportunity for Progressive. \n In the direct channel, our multi-carrier property agency and market-leading quote volume, are driving success. We're investing to improve the profitability in our underwritten property business to support continued Robinson growth in the independent agency channel. Through rate increases, coverage limitations and underwriting eligibility restrictions, we have improved results relative to our competitors. \n Best-in-class product design will support growth in the less volatile states, while a reduction in our Florida exposure and growth limits in our other states exposed to volatile catastrophe risk will reduce the volatility of our overall property, results, and we will continue to use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital from extreme events. \n Thanks again for joining us this morning. We'll now begin our live question-and-answer session."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Yes. So good question. To Tricia's point, overall, we feel very good about our reserves, right? Our goal is always adequate reserves, with minimal variation and our philosophy has been very consistent over the long term. We have developed unfavorably year-to-date, about 0.6 points on the combined ratio; Personal Auto, about 0.3 point; and Commercial, about 2%. That's in line with where we've been in the past at midyear. And if you look historically, we've ended the year generally within 0.1 or 0.2 points.\n To Tricia's point -- and we do have a paper that we publish on our investor site, so you could read more detail about our methodology. But we will look at about 25% or a little bit over 25% of the reserves monthly. And then on the other 75%, we have an inflation factor that we apply. So if any new features come in or existing features, they automatically go up with inflation based off severity.\n As features age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, we have automatic adjustments for those. So we feel that we've kept up very well with the rising costs. And to your point, Tracy, we have seen somewhat of a slowdown relative to closing claims compared to the past, just with everything going on over the last couple of years. But because of that mechanism we have that we can adjust as they age, as they become attorney-repped, et cetera, naturally, we've been able to keep up just as we would have intended."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, we continue to work through the challenges handed to us through the macroeconomic environment. Uncertainty has been the theme of our post-COVID world, and that has continued into the second quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the way the organization has responded. Flexibility was our theme for the 2021 annual report, and our people have continued to exhibit flexibility into 2022. \n During the second quarter, we continued to feel the impact of inflation with used car prices still near all-time highs and continued rising cost to repair vehicles. On the other hand, record high fuel costs and the resulting reduced driving provides a modest tailwind to auto frequency. We will continue to monitor the environment closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure we meet our promise to 96 combined ratio. \n As we stated in the first quarter, we believe our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us. and that's reflected in our slowing pace of second quarter rate changes. In the quarter, we raised rates in 17 states, which had about a 2% increase countrywide, bringing our year-to-date rate increase to about 9% and our year-over-year rate increase to about 16%. While these rate changes continue to have the expected effect on PIF growth, I'm encouraged by recent results.  \n As competitors took rate and we increased our investment in direct acquisition in many markets, we have seen prospect volume rise, and June marked the first month since May of 2021 with year-over-year new app growth in our direct channel. While the path ahead undoubtedly contains many obstacles, I'm encouraged to see our efforts bear fruit.  \n I'd now like to change focus to the main topic of today's presentation, which is our property business. While our state expansion to write property insurance has enabled us to increase our addressable market and accelerate growth in the important Robinsons segment, it's no secret that we have faced challenges. \n Over the last 5 years, we've been unable to consistently run the business at our target margins. And between 2017 and 2021, have posted an underwriting loss. We were the first to admit that we have work to do to get this business on track. As I mentioned in my letter, our current pricing and underwriting activities do not adequately address weather-driven volatility. And we are in the process of executing a number of steps to turn the business around. \n We realize these actions will require more time than originally anticipated to ensure consistent delivery of our target combined ratio for the property business. As such, we have revised our expected underwriting profitability over the coming years, which led to a write-off of $225 million of goodwill, primarily related to our purchase of ARX Holding Corp. The remaining $228 million of goodwill is also primarily attributable to the acquisition and reflects the increase in addressable market we gain for our Agency auto product that bundling represents. \n The team of people working on our property business continues to focus time on improving our underwriting, managing risk concentration and more precisely matching rate to risk at a much more granular level. For the last 5 years, Dave Pratt, our soon-to-be retired Property General Manager, has worked closely with senior leaders from ASI as they transformed our property business from a regional carrier to the tenth largest property carrier in the country, now writing in 47 states. \n With Dave's impending retirement next year, Tanya Fjare, who has more than 20 years' experience at ASI and Progressive has taken over leadership of our property P&L and is partnering with supporting groups across Progressive from product, claims, IT, legal and finance to ensure we're building the products, experiences and team to create the broadly available and competitively priced and profitable product offering that we've all grown to expect from Progressive. While we cannot change course overnight, today, we will share the steps we are taking today to reach our goal. \n For our main presentation today, first, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President and nearly 20-year Progressive veteran, will discuss our market opportunity and our investments in property product distribution. Following Pat, Dave Pratt will go into more detail on our results, the investments we've made in people and product and a real-world case study on how our actions have resulted in favorable results. Dave is a 31-year Progressive employee who has held numerous roles throughout his illustrious career. Dave has been an important part of Progressive's success over his decades of service, and we will miss him upon his upcoming retirement. \n Thank you again for joining us. And now I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat? Absolutely, Elyse. I think the headline for our private passenger auto is we think trends are encouraging, and it's playing out as we had hoped. So like we said, we had the majority of the rates behind us with a caveat of a few larger states. If you look at the 10-Q, our direct prospects are up 5% this quarter. They were down 11% last quarter, and that is with the spend down 7%, as you've identified. So we're spending less per new prospect with a ton of upside because we still don't have local media on in 19 states. That was 26 states in April. We continue to be able to open up with local advertising. \n So said another way, competitors are less aggressive due to their profitability challenges. We've seen that play out with some of the Qs that have been reported. And that allows us to acquire leads at a more efficient rate. So we'll continue to spend to get more, but we won't spend unnecessarily to create more business. I think -- I don't usually talk about 1 month in a quarter but I think it's important to know that the prospect volume in June of 2022 was our largest June ever. So we're pretty pleased about incoming volume and excited about continuing that, of course, with the caveat of all things that could happen with -- in this last couple of years. \n I think another way to look at it in terms of are we positioned well, and this might be a little bit further afield of your question, but we want to look at average written premium. So if you look at average written premium over 2021, it was 0. In 20 -- in first quarter, it was up about 6%, second quarter up about 11%. So those are written numbers and on average, take 4-ish months to earn in or hit the denominator for the combined ratio. \n The numerator is increasing about 7% to 8% based on frequency and severity changes that we've posted. And so right now, with the exception of a couple of states where we need a fair amount of rate, we believe we'll be able to take modest rate increases. We've talked in the past, with the exception of this year, about taking small bites of the apple. We'd like to get into that because we know that our customers want stable rates. So we feel good about our position. \n I also feel really great about our continued investment in segmentation. So about 65% of our countrywide premium are on 87. We just rolled out a new product model, 88 in Iowa, and we'll have more information on that. But overall, we feel great. We'll advertise more and open up more local markets as we feel necessary when we have the right rate. And of course, each state is different. But we feel pretty bullish. Well, frequency was down about 8%. We're going to continue to watch that. We also look at vehicle miles traveled. And March through May, it was down about 12%. In June and through July, we're seeing it down a little bit more. We're not quite certain of all the reasons behind it. We believe gas prices might be a little bit of that. Gas prices are fairly inelastic. And we also know through surveys that maybe 15% to 20% of the population are still pretty nervous about going out and about. So they still are fearful of COVID and rightly so. So we look at that. \n And I think what I'm watching closely, and I don't know that we'll know for a couple of quarters, is how work from home settles in. So I know that -- I talked to a lot of my peers in other industries and there's a lot less people coming in. And could that change after the summer? We don't know. So we're going to watch those 3 things, to look at vehicle, miles traveled and frequency. So I'm going to more watch on those. \n As far as severity, we look at the Manheim Index for used car prices. That's ticked down a teeny bit, but still at all-time high. So we'll continue to watch that as well as sort of secondary and tertiary things like labor cost in body shops. If techs are making more and if there is less of a supply of people fixing those cars, we know that rentals could extend longer. So again, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen from the severity trends. But we do obviously account for every single data point as we continue to go. And we look at -- when we're looking at our increases, we bake that in. Do you guys want to add anything to that? You good? Does that answer your question, Elyse? Yes. I would say we'd look for any kind of growth. So I know that we've talked -- we've worked with construction builders before. And we've talked about mortgage companies. We've had actually some tests and things that we've done with some mortgage companies, Rocket Mortgage as an example. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that, Pat? Yes, I think there are several analogies. Obviously, the ones that Dave talked about was age of roof, et cetera. But water damage is a lot. So if you can have systems in place that alert you to something if you're out of the home, there's water damage. So we look at all of those things in terms of let's think water damage, think of security systems, think of number of people in the household. So I think there's a lot of related items that we've looked at in the past several years and we'll continue to look at to understand kind of that same rate to risk in home as we have in our auto product. Yes, each state is a little different animal, and it really depends on when we got the rate that we needed and when it's earning in and when we feel comfortable that we want to grow and grow profitably. So although we wouldn't share the aggregate premium or the states really necessarily for that matter, we'll continue to assess that channel by channel, state by state as we get the rate that we need in order to be adequate. Yes. A significant part is driven by car prices, total losses, cost to repair. And I talked a little bit about the other parts of that, that go along with that. So parts prices are up around 5%, labor rates are up around 3% and our rental cars are up between 0.5% and 1%. So all those inclusive. A lot of it has to do with car prices, both from a total loss perspective and a used car perspective. And obviously, if the used car prices are up and they're up significantly since pre-COVID, many of those won't be totaled, and the repairs become more expensive. Yes. And severity is up 16% overall, but up in the 20-ish percent rate in both collision and PD. Thank you. Yes, I would say the weighting of Robinsons are greater in the states that we've grown in more historically from ASI, from ARX. And that's also one of the reasons why we want to be able to expand through the country, not just to derisk the portfolio but to growing Robinsons, which is why we will likely add more Platinum agents in those states and reduce Platinum agents in the states we've had before. Do you want to add anything, Pat? Yes. I think I'll start with the latter part of your question. Yes, I think the competition will be greater in those states. The goodwill impairment was based on just the significant catastrophic losses that we've had. And when we purchased ARX, we had certain assumptions on combined ratios. And of course, we have a CAT load. It's far surpassed that, as Dave talked about. So it was that. When we -- we periodically look at goodwill. When we looked at it, we took into account the severe catastrophes where we're concentrated as well as just some recent legislation in Florida.\n As you know, we wanted to not renew about 60,000 policies. There's some new legislation that requires us or where we'll ask our customers if they had a new roof or the life of a roof is at least 5 years, we will renew them, which will be good because that means they've got a new roof and it's something we'd want to write. But we -- so we're not sure exactly how many of those 60,000 we will not renew. We took that into account when we were looking at the impairment. Yes. I mean one of the reasons we purchased ARX was to have access to those bundled customers in the independent agent channel. We know independent agents love our service, love our ability to handle claims well. But what would happen is they would have to write with someone else that they wanted to bundle. So that was a big effort. We are very broadly distributed in our independent agent channel, have over 40,000 independent agents. So what we did was really try to have a few -- or more of a scarcity model on the Platinum program with certain agents, that we wanted to have them write the Robinsons, our auto home bundle, be the #1, 2 or 3 carrier in their firm. So that's sort of how we look at that. \n We also then had to make some changes, whether it was compensation changes in the form of higher commissions as well as writing 12-month auto policies to align with those 12-month home policies. So there's about 4,000 Platinum agents across the country. We work well with them. They consider us very preferred in their firms, and that's why we want to make sure that we're adequately priced on both auto and home to continue to grow with those agents.  \n In fact, I was just with -- we have an agency council that we had an outgoing group and an incoming group, and we talked a lot about efforts to grow, and I'm bullish about being able to do that obviously in the right venues. Well, we rate to have our target profit margin. You get a multi-product discount with the -- when you have multi-products. But we don't -- I don't know that we ever really talk specifically about those amounts. Yes, it's really dependent on each state. So in some states, we've had some underwriting and bill plan restrictions. Obviously, an easier way to go is what I've talked about in terms of turning local media off. And those are, for the most part, what we use to try to stall growth a little bit when we don't have adequate rates. I think, generally, we have to look -- we have to go back and look at the specific math, but I would say probably generally. I think you do a little bit of both. I mean I think a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing. So I talked -- when Elyse asked the question, I talked about efficiently acquiring leads has to do with the competition in the digital space. So we -- the national brand is really important. It is one of our pillars -- our strategic pillars. So we want to be the brand that talks about savings protection. We want to be known that gives consideration. We want to be on the short list.\n And then the local marketing really through most of online search. That's a nice lever to be able to turn off and on when we want to grow. But again, that's very dependent on supply and demand and what's happening in the industry with our competition. So I feel like we're in a good position now. Again, we have some states we want to turn on. John talked about a couple of large states we'd love to get adequate rates in so we can continue to grow. But we feel like we're in a good position. We have some levers, and we've had a tremendous amount of growth in the last 5 years.\n In fact, we've added 7 million PIFs and grown Auto PIFs 70%. So -- and that was coming off the last hard market. I'm not going to say that we're going to grow that same amount in the next couple of years, but that's always been our playbook to position ourselves, to get out ahead of rate, have a lot of different levers on marketing and then move as quickly as we can. Yes, I would say it's still a short tail. I think in the last couple of years, when you look at the data on subrogation from a property damage, whether it's incoming or outbound, there's been delays for many different reasons. And probably more recently, in the last couple of quarters has been on staffing. You've looked at the unemployment rate, and I know myself, along with many of my peers have wanted to really get ahead of staffing, and it's been a little bit more challenging.\n Personally at Progressive, we feel like we're in a really good position right now. I wouldn't necessarily have said that a couple of quarters ago. So the timing depends on when you're able to settle that claim and then, of course, get the paperwork to the other company and of course, for us, either we're paying out to them or they're paying out to us. So I think it's still short tail. I think that will -- hopefully, we expect it will level out at some point when staffing is normalized across the industry, and we get back to sort of claims as usual.\n I will say that, that is an important piece because anytime that you can get salvage or subrogation settled more timely, that hits the bottom line. In fact, I was talking to our claims President a few weeks ago, and we feel like we are very adequately staffed in claims, and we're actually going to move some people over to subrogation and salvage towards -- in the near future until the end of the year to get some of those closed in a more timely fashion. Yes, I feel very comfortable. Gary, you can comment on this. We have our head of actuary here. But I feel very good about our strength of reserves. To date, we're about 0.6 points on the CRM favorable. We were favorable in this quarter, and we feel really good. And part of our reserving that we look into, and Gary, you can talk about this, is we have a robust role forward process where we take into account in existing and new features, inflationary factors. We would love to write more business in California. It is the most populous state. Unfortunately, right now, we don't -- we aren't able to get adequate rates. And once we're able to do that, we are open for business and we'll write as much as we can. Right now, there's about 30 auto programs representing close to half the California market that have rate increases pending. We have 1 pending in one of our auto programs from January, we'll likely have at least another one in the near future.\n So if we can get the rate that we need to be adequately rated, we want to write all the business we can. The moratorium on rate increases in California is unfortunate because we don't think it serves the consumers of California, and you only have a couple of things to do. And there's a couple of levers that we talked about, and we'll use those tactics to slow growth, but we want to be a part of the future California market, and we'll do what we can to get there. What? I'm sorry, what -- could you repeat your question? I didn't hear that. Got it. Got it. Okay. Well, I think -- and my point, Ryan, was more of it's a really big ship now. So it's a much bigger ship than it was back in 2016. So as a percentage basis, growth growing 70% in Auto is going to be tough. The bottom line is we will grow as fast as we possibly can at or below our target profit margins. And that's what we're going to do as the hard market continues. It's sort of hard to foreshadow what will happen right now because I feel like we're right in the midst of it. And we have the rate that we're earning in, yet to earn in and more advertising to open up and then, of course, a lot of it depends on what the competition is doing.\n So the reason for saying that was just that we have grown a tremendous amount and just any company when you get the size of us, it's harder to grow as quickly on a percentage basis. I mean we're always thinking about the future, but we got out ahead of rates. So if you think about 2021, we had about 8 points and most of that was in the second half. We have 9 points year-to-date with the 5 points earning in. So I feel -- that's why I said we may have modest rate increases. And again, there are a couple of states where we need a lot more rate, and that's on average. So when I talk about the 8 points, 9 points and the 5 yet to earn in, that is very different depending on different states, but on average. So that's where we feel good. Likely, we'll have to take some modest rate increases as we watch the trends, but we will do that as we see the trends unfold. Yes. Yes our -- where we want to grow is PIF growth. And so that includes both the new and renewal business. And retention has always been our holy grail. You pay a lot to get a customer in and you want to keep them through stable rates and great service. Obviously, when you have to crank up rates a lot when trends change dramatically, you're going to lose people. So we knew that would happen. And -- but we want to keep everybody we can at or below our target margins for the renewal business. \n And then new business, obviously, we want to come in because we want to take advantage of a competitive market when others are raising rates after we've raised rates. So both are important. PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth, and that will take a longer time. New business is more precise, more day-to-day. PIF growth will take a little bit longer since we've had some degradation in PLE, and we're looking forward to starting to ramp up PIF growth. I think it will be a little bit different, likely in the different channels. And I don't want to signal exactly when we'll see it grow. A lot will depend on the caveats that we talked about with states opening up, media opening up and getting our rates stable. I don't want to signal that. I'll let you know as it unfolds. Yes. It just means that the majority of the rate increases that we were able to get, again, the caveat with a couple of states, are on The Street. And then that's why I wanted to try to walk through a little bit about how we think about them earning in. And so when you have the rate, it's going to take some time to earn in. And we feel good about that we're in the heart of that and that we still have 5 more points to earn in as we speak. Yes. We look at inflation differently with medical and physical damage. But we see BI trends up a bit, general damages specifically with attorney-repped. And of course, we look at medical inflation as well when we look at our rates for each line coverage, whether it's medical payments or bodily injury. I think we always learn every time there's an acquisition, and we haven't been a big acquirer over the years, I think we've learned a lot of lessons. I think any new product that you go into, you learn. And so when we went on -- when we went direct, we didn't make money for quite some time because we were learning. We do the same with every new product. But I think -- I look at acquisitions more of is there some technology that we want? Is there some access we want? So ARX was access. Is this an easy way to continue our portfolio? So that's one of the reasons why we acquired Protective on the commercial line side because we knew we had the acumen to look at smaller fleets. They have medium to larger fleets. So that was something that was important to us as we grow into the fleet program. That's really how I look at it.\n I think acquisitions, if you don't do them very often, you're always going to learn a lot. One of the things that we have built since then is an area of the company where we look at M&A and we look at what we need in order to be successful in that. And that's within our strategy team. And so we're getting our arms much better around that. I think that's what ARX taught us is that you have to have probably a lot more investments early on in order to get your arms around the product. And we're doing that with Protective. I'm very excited about the Protective acquisition, where we're at. It was much different than ARX just as a learning and how we can leverage that much more quickly. Not at this point. We'll get there. The first, we know -- first, wanted to create the BOP products, and we went really small. So if you think about small business, it's usually defined as 100 employees or less. We're at 20 employees or less. We're very, very surgical to understand that rate to risk and we wanted to expand it out to the states. So we're in 37 states. We're learning every day. As we learn more, just like we have in many parts of our commercial business, we'll be able to expand that. So we get more and more comfort every single day. Yes. We've had what we've called Progressive Advantage Agency for many, many years, and we continue to build a stable of carriers that can serve many different value of homes. And some of those are -- many of those are in places where we're going to grow. But the partnerships are really incredible, and they want to grow with us, and it's all about the right rate at the right time. So we continue to grow there. We've put it online with our HomeQuote Explorer, where we have a buy button in -- I forget how many states. 38 for Progressive Home. So yes, we continue to invest in there. It's nice to have the partners to work with. And again, we've always been about choice and we want to make sure if our rate isn't the best, that we have opportunities to be able to have our customers still bundle with Progressive Auto and those partnerships."

            "content": "Thanks, Tricia. While our focus has historically been on vehicle insurance, we've always recognized that property insurance is an important segment of U.S. personal lines. And as we continue to grow our personal auto business, meeting the property needs of our growing auto customer base is increasingly important. \n Over more than a decade, we've regularly shared our investments to meet those needs as part of our Destination Era strategy. These began back in 2008 through our Progressive Home Advantage partnerships. And today, Dave and I will restate the business case for investing in property, share our progress driving market share growth and more importantly, the initiatives underway to ensure that we deliver profitable property growth in support of becoming consumers' and agents' #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. \n The U.S. property and casualty market is almost $800 billion in premiums written and more than 90% of that isn't yet insured with us. Today's focus is on the $381 billion U.S. personal lines market, where we enjoy about 10% of the combined U.S. auto and home market share. We're the third largest auto writer with almost 14% share, while today, we write just below 2% of the U.S. homeowners market. \n Despite many reports of its demise due to technology advancements reducing accident frequency, U.S. auto direct premiums written grew about 4% annually over the past 5 years. And at more than $260 billion, the U.S. auto market continues to represent a growth opportunity. The U.S. homeowners market continues to grow faster than auto, at more than 5% annually over the past 5 years and more than 8% growth in 2021. \n Recent inflationary forces, loss cost increases and resulting rate increases are further accelerating growth in both the U.S. home and auto markets. Let's break this down by channel and segment. \n I expect that many of you are familiar with how we think about consumer market segments across channel, protection needs and auto and home bundle status. The rows on this table are the 3 largest U.S. distribution channels: captive agent, independent agent and direct-to-consumer. While all 3 channels have been growing premiums written, channel share has been slowly migrating from captive agents to direct as technology adoption drives continued e-commerce migration across industries. The independent agent channel continues to maintain share due to its strong consumer value proposition, which combines local agent expertise with the breadth of product availability and depth of carrier options that deliver the ease and savings that consumers value. \n The columns here are Progressive's consumer segments from simple needs inconsistently insured, auto-only households or Sams; to continuously insured renters, Dianes; to consistently insured but unbundled homeowners, Wrights; to our well-known bundled auto and home Robinsons. You'll note that our market share is approaching 20% for the combined Sam, Diane and Wrights market, while we remain underpenetrated with Robinsons at less than 3% share. Note that this Robinson share does not include the more than $1 billion written by unaffiliated carriers through the direct Progressive Advantage Agency. \n You'll also note that more than half of the combined U.S. auto and home market is bundled. And more than 80% of that is bundled through an agent. The captive agent channel currently over-indexes on Robinson's share, but as more Robinsons migrate to the direct and independent agent channels we'll benefit due to strong market share across each of those channels. Our focus on Robinsons is driven by our untapped potential in this large and growing market segment, which makes up more than half of the total U.S. personal lines market.\n We've shared in prior investor presentations that current period financials fail to fully reflect the hidden balance sheet of future growth as our current customers both continue to renew and expand their relationship with Progressive, which delivers both top and bottom line financial benefit for years to come. Investing to expand our offerings to better penetrate the existing approximately $200 billion Robinsons market creates value in 2 critical ways. \n First, we drive top and bottom line calendar period unit, premium and underwriting profit growth through acquiring customers who bundle their auto and home today. As I shared on the last slide, more than half of the U.S. auto and home market is bundled. So when these customers shop and switch, it's critical for us to have a competitive bundled offer to meet their needs. The nature of these Robinsons bundled homeowners is inherently more stable than other customer segments. And they also have approximately 3x the policy life expectancy of our Sams segment. Acquiring Robinsons drives growth both today and in future periods. \n Second, for more than 85 years, we've been a leader in acquiring simpler needs, monoline auto customers, and we continue to view this as an important pipeline of future growth. Ensuring we have broadly available and competitively priced renters, condo and homeowners offerings is essential to ensure we meet the needs of these customers throughout their lifetimes. As we nurture these younger and simpler needs customers throughout their life events, we create and capture value for the firm today and unlock future growth potential. \n Since embarking on our Destination Era strategy, we've made major investments in acquiring ASI, launching new quoting platforms across channels, building our in-house Advantage agency, creating a Platinum offering for our independent agent partners and investing well over $1 billion on bundle and save branding and marketing in just the past 3 years. \n These investments are driving Robinsons growth across distribution channels, which validates the potential for us to grow in this important market segment. While our property profitability hasn't consistently met our expectations. We also write more than $3 billion in profitable auto premium for these Robinson households across channels. And while some of that would likely have been accessible without the complementary property offering, we're confident that having broadly available and competitively priced property is helping to drive this growth.\n As I shared a few minutes ago, more than 80% of the bundled auto and home business we're looking to acquire is distributed through agents. The Robinson opportunity through independent agents alone represents more than $60 billion in annualized premiums written. And as the largest seller of auto through the independent agent channel, we are well positioned to leverage our massive distribution footprint and more than 85 years of experience selling through agents to grow our share in the channel. \n I wanted to highlight 2 key initiatives that facilitate our independent agent channel Robinsons growth. First, recognizing that Progressive has historically been an industry leader in ease of use for agents and customers, we built a streamlined quote experience for the home and auto bundle, which makes it fast and easy for agents to enter customer information once and quote and sell a bundle of most of the Progressive vehicle and property products, either upfront or over time as customers experience life events and need more and/or different protection products. \n Second, shortly after buying and controlling interest in ASI, we launched our Platinum program, which affords unique customer and agent benefits for bundling home and auto with Progressive. Over the past several years, we've continued to expand this footprint, bringing our highly competitive nationally-branded and easy to quote and sell bundled offering to leading agencies across the country. \n Beyond gaining share of the currently bundled independent agent market, close to $100 billion of Robinsons premium is distributed through captive or exclusive agencies. And this is despite lacking the superior consumer value proposition that results from carrier choice or depth that is available through independent agents. \n As a leading nationally-branded auto and home carrier, we believe we are well positioned to continue to both capture share of the existing bundled independent agent market, while also capitalizing on the ongoing shift from captive agents into the independent agent and direct channels. \n Despite the majority of Robinsons business being sold through agents today, more than 30% of total auto insurance is sold direct. And we believe as younger auto consumers go through the life events that increase the complexity of their household insurance needs, having broadly available online property insurance will become increasingly important to meet the needs of these future customers. \n Property risks are complex. No two homes are alike. They don't come with VINs, and as such, property insurance products have historically been built to be sold through agents. Homeowners, especially first-time home buyers, often struggle to identify important property characteristics like roof shape, shingle type, plumbing type, et cetera. And as such, most property products don't easily translate to online or mobile direct-to-consumer quoting and binding. We continue to invest to make it easier for consumers to quote and buy property insurance online through our multi-carrier HomeQuote Explorer platform.  \n This proprietary system guide shoppers through the home coverage interview, leveraging data fill and imagery to simplify the quoting process and deliver a multi-carrier shopping experience. This investment is paying off as we continue to lead the industry in desktop homeowner quote initiations. \n Additionally, while getting shoppers through the quoting process is half the battle, forcing online shoppers to go off-line and call to complete their sale is an antiquated and poor customer experience. And we've been investing to add online buy button functionality to the Progressive Home Direct property offering with availability now approaching 40 states. \n Recognizing the market opportunity ahead of us and the critical role that broadly available and competitively-priced property products play in our future success, let's transition over to Dave Pratt for an update on progress with our property product development and exposure management initiatives. Yes. I mean I think the embedded insurance into transactions or life events where people are acquiring the underlying asset, be it in auto, be it a boat, motorcycle, RV or be it a home, presents a shopping opportunity where we absolutely want to position our products to both facilitate the transaction by ensuring the collateral can transfer and be protected provided it's got some outstanding loan or paper on it. But we are starting to work more with, as you mentioned, digital lenders as well as more traditional lenders through independent agents. So it is a growth opportunity for us, and we are constantly looking at how to position our products best, where consumers want them, need them and, frankly, are shopping for them so we can participate in those transactions. Yes. No. I think that's the primary driver, right? We've been in the auto business for 85 years. We've been expanding our property business over the last 5 to 10 to get to the 47% where we write today. So there's still a mismatch between kind of how long we've been in the market and how long we frankly had competitive property offerings to bundle with our auto offerings. No. To win in the agency channel, we have to have a viable value proposition for both the clients of the agency and for the agents themselves. So on the client side, we have to have competitive and stable pricing, we have to have a quality product and we have to have really competitive pricing. And that's where, as Dave mentioned, we've got work to do to expand the perils that we write, improve the segmentation and, frankly, just have more competitive pricing for the agent's clients. \n And then on the agent side, we have to have great ease of use and competitive compensation for the effort it takes to write a policy with Progressive. And that's where, as Tricia mentioned, the Platinum program has competitive offering of compensation for our agents that pays more based on how much and what quality of business or type of business they're placing with us over time. \n And then we're known for ease of use through great systems and technology over many, many years. So not explicitly buying market share or, as you said, buying shelf space for a proxy. We are competing based on a quality of a competitive product for the clients in the agency channel and our value proposition for the agents who sell it. Yes. It may not -- we've seen residual markets come and go in various states over many decades. And as you note, generally, when there's not a willing voluntary private market participation, there has to be a backstop given the mandatory insurance requirements. So could there be growth of a residual market in California? Absolutely. And there, it's up to the regulator to decide if that's a path that they want to go down.\n I think we've seen historically states like New York, where it grew rapidly. And then with voluntary participation, there was better options, more competition and consumers benefit when there's availability that brings competition that drives affordability. And carriers compete on both price and service whereas the backstop residual markets, unfortunately, typically provide a minimum level of both. So is it possible? Absolutely. Is there precedent? Yes, we've seen markets where voluntary participation shrinks and residual markets grow. And therefore, it could happen in California."

            "content": "We can tell you it's well known that there are a few key states where we cannot get rate, and those are significant states. So it's not a small percentage of the U.S. households that is not getting the local media from us. So it's a definite upside for us once we get rate adequate in those states. A rough estimate for the impact of vehicle valuation on severity across our physical damage lines is around half. So that's not exactly the cars, but as a walking around number, it's pretty close. And just for clarity there, that 11% includes our customers that are bundled with third-party carriers. So we started offering bundles in our direct channel well before the agency penetration, which we achieved with, again, ASI, ARX. So the distribution of the home is a little more aligned with countrywide because of the footprint of our direct business was obviously countrywide from the inception of direct, and we had homeowner coverage pretty much across the country on the direct side, caveating. Of course, there are a few markets that are troublesome for all carriers. So it's a little tighter there. But generally, we're pretty well distributed for Robinsons on the direct side, a little more concentrated on the agency side. Sure. The lifetime value calculation would include not only the PLE difference but the average premium difference. So we target common margins across segments of the business. So for -- across the auto program, we're targeting similar margins, but different segments have different average premiums as well as policy life expectancy and you sort of multiply those together, and that's how you come to a bigger lifetime value. That's -- probably. Josh, if I might add a little bit there. I think that's a great question. And I think the answer is plays to our strengths. So if you look at the percentage of folks coming to shop at Progressive that we would attribute to mass media from the kind of the time frame that you talked about to today, it has shifted a lot to much more specifically attributable media and we are great at analyzing the data fairly real time and making decisions very quickly to be able to redeploy dollars to go to the most effective way of bringing people in.\n So I think it's because of technology and the data available increasingly in a real-time basis that is allowing us to get more and more of our media spend really, really effective. Mass media, as Tricia mentioned and our brand are obviously the first step that's crucial to have that brand awareness, but then the agility and the data and analysis that goes into really targeting, again, I think, plays to our strengths and has allowed us to continue to grow advertising spend and be super efficient. I'll just offer. It's also very dependent upon the competitive market. So we've seen a few competitors report second quarter, combined with over 100. We have 1 competitor who is reporting their rate increases monthly. We see another place where in large markets, we see very mature competitors taking multiple double-digit increases in very short periods. So it's an environment that's pretty hard. And if competitors continue to take aggressive action, we're going to be able to get back to PIF growth much faster than if they don't, both obviously on the new side. But the retention is not only a function of our rate increases, it's relative to what our consumers can find out in the marketplace when they go shop and if competitors have all raised rates as well, then our retention will improve.\n So it's really difficult to project. I think all of our product managers are taking the right actions at the local level. And as we continue to note, if we can get rate adequate in some key markets, we'll be in even better position to grow. 38 for Progressive Home."

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website, although our CEO Tricia Griffith will make a brief statement. The company will then use the remainder of the events to respond to questions. Action is moderation for the event will be Progressive Director of Investor Relations Doug Constantine. At this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you, Emily, and good morning. Although our Quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Questions can only be asked by telephone dial-in participants. The dial-in instructions maybe be found at investors. Progressive. com/events. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first quarter of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements, and other discussions of the challenges we face. Before going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Well, thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Anniversaries are natural time to look back on the past, and since this is the first investor call of Progressive's 85th year, I wanted to do just that. We have grown from a scrappy startup trying to find a foothold in the great depression to the tenth largest homeowners carrier, the third largest personal auto carrier, and the Number 1 commercial auto carrier. In just the last five years, our total company-wide written premium has nearly doubled.  Nowhere has growth been more remarkable than in Commercial Lines, which just passed the major milestone of over $9 billion in written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis. We grew commercial auto premiums over 200% in the last five years all while generally achieving a better than average industry profit margin and ended March just shy of $1 million, Commercial Line's policies enforced. It has truly been an incredible run with significant opportunities still waiting to be captured.  Congratulations to the Commercial Lines team, and thank you to all Progressive's employees and customers who have made the last 85 years so extraordinary. Throughout our 85-year history, we've have worked through many hard and soft markets, and we continue to address the hard market we're in today. While some indices suggest the value of used vehicle does leveling or even beginning to decline, used vehicle values are still significantly above those of early 2021. Steady but increasing trend in bodily injury severity has also contributed to the increase in loss cost we've experienced.  Further as a country emerge from the Omicron wave. We saw Personal Auto vehicle miles traveled recover to fourth-quarter 2021 levels, which were in the 9% to 10% range below the pre -pandemic baseline. Our response to these trends have been to reduce marketing expenses, increase underwriting scrutiny, limits bill plan options. And in the first quarter, we implemented rate increases of 7 points in Personal Auto that still in to earn in, which is an addition to the eight points we expecting 2021.  While we're making progress, we still have more work to do to ensure all of our states reach rate adequacy. Our rate and non-rate actions have had the expected effect on Personal Auto growth. While Personal Lines PPIF growth is still positive on a year-over-year basis, sequential PPIF growth is negative. New applications are down year-over-year, and a policy life expectancy is also declining. When we look across all the metrics we track, it seems likely that we're ahead of our competitors and increasing rates, which explains a large part of our slowdown in growth.  As we look forward to the rest of 2022 we're optimistic. As more states reach rate adequacy, we expect to be able to increase marketing spend and re-engage the growth engine. Because of the advantages we believe we have and the way we buy media, we can adjust marketing spend at the local and segment level and in such a way to ensure the new business we write meets our economic goals. And since we believe we are ahead of the competitors in taking right actions, we hope to continue our long-term trend of writing more than our fair share of clubs.  Even as we face these macroeconomic pressures, we have not slowed our pursuit of segmentation superiority. Our U.S. Personal Auto product model is now available in over eight -- in over half the states and is showing early promising results, especially among more preferred segments. We have also further expanded the footprint of our 4.1 homeowners\u2019 product into four additional states in the first quarter bringing the total to 12. Our new normal since the onset of the pandemic has been disruptions in the economy that has buffeted our business. While there are many paths, the future can take, I'm confident in our strategy and our people and believe our greatest successes are still to come in the next 85 years. Thank you. I will take your questions.\nOperator: To be added to the questions [Operator Instructions] In order to get to as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up The last question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jimmy, your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So I had a question first, just on the pricing environment and what your expectations are in terms of getting price hikes through all of the states because I think some of the states like California, obviously, been robust into raised price -- to give permission to raise prices. Are you seeing any changes in that at all, or do you expect changes over the next few months?\nTricia Griffith: We still have some challenges in a few states, including the one you mentioned, and we're working closely with regulators to get the rates that we need. Our desire is to be able to be more open, to open up our bill plan options, to open up or to loosen our underwriting restrictions. And once we get that rate, we can start to have that growth engine move. So we've got a couple of states that we're still working with -- a couple of big states that we've had some success in and why we feel pretty optimistic about the future.\nJimmy Bhullar: And the reluctance of California and some of the states that have been difficult as it is because of the strong results companies had in 2020 and early '21, or is there something else behind?\nTricia Griffith: Specifically, in California, it's a little bit how they look back versus perspective. And so I think the data is showing that these are real trends -- inflationary trends, and the need across the industry is very significant, and we want to be open for Californians, and we'll work closely with the regulators. So let's make that happen.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just on the claims trends in January and February, do you think your business saw benefit from the Omicron wave at all in the early parts of the first quarter?\nTricia Griffith: I don't know if there was a huge benefit. Things open up a little bit more, but still vehicle miles traveled and frequency is still both on pre -pandemic levels or do you want to add anything on that. During the early period we did see vehicle miles\u2019 travel drop a little relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, we've seen that since return in March. So a very modest benefit, if any at all.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then just lastly, have you changed anything in terms of how you're investing in this environment, any major classes that you're reemphasizing or conversely, where you're seeing good value?\nTricia Griffith: I'll talk a little bit about our investing guidelines and then John Bowers and assigned John, if you want to add anything, let me now. We've had a line standing approach to our investing and that is, we don't want to target a certain book yields or level of investment and income for that matter. We want to earn the best risk adjusted rate of that we're showing on our portfolio. And most importantly, John's team, their most important job is to protect the balance sheet. That way the operating company can grow as profitably and as fast as possible. John, do you want to add anything?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks, Tricia. I would only add to that. Obviously, the environment is pretty dynamic right now, and we continue to search out for good opportunities that would create long-term value for the portfolio, but always with a focus on Number 1, protecting the capital, and then getting the best total return that we can in the portfolio.\nDoug Constantine: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew, please, go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the underwriting restrictions that you mentioned, could you give a little color on what in particular you're doing there?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. Andrew, first of all, I enjoyed your write-up last week. Welcome to P&C Insurance. And --\nAndrew Kligerman: Okay.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. And we have a couple of different underwriting restrictions. So we look at -- we'll look at gathering additional data, possibly, if we have more questions on a customer. So we call it pre -binding verification. So we may ask a little more specifics to make sure we have the [Indiscernible] adjust right and -- things like that. Do you want to add anything, Pat?\nPat Callahan: I think that's exactly what we do, is when we want to be certain, we've got all the underwriting characteristics accurately reported, we will have some additional follow-up questions for customers, both at new business and then occasionally at renewal. Additionally, we will put restrictions on how open we are from a bill plan perspective and other things. Just as we look at overall profitability, we want to make sure we're getting the right rate for our new business customers at inception.\nAndrew Kligerman: And as a results of these initiatives, what percent of your book ends up with -- or has ended up with the rate change over the last quarter and maybe even the last 12 months as you've gone through these underwriting restrictions?\nTricia Griffith: I think it's more of the entering in and getting the right rate at inception. So we've had a higher percentage of customers that once we have the additional information, we have blocked and they've likely gotten somewhere else because we don't have the accurate information.\nAndrew Kligerman: I see, I see. And any sense of proportion on that, Tricia? That you could give us, like, how much of your book you're seeing that on?\nTricia Griffith: Probably, I would say of incoming close, probably double-digit low. Low double digits which is from half that when we were more comfortable with underwriting margin. So what we're trying to do here is ensure that every piece of new business coming in the door is going to be profitable for us. We understand that there is a distribution or on our pricing. So on the tail where we're less sure that we are going to make money, that is where we're going to ask a lot more questions and frequently those questions lead to the customer seeking insurance elsewhere. That has more frequently the outcome than an adjustment in the overall premium because frankly, some customers are looking to achieve a lower premium by not answering the questions accurately. So some of these efforts are focused on that segment. By pushing that segment to our competitors, obviously, we ensure that we're profitable. And to the extent our competitors do not employ such methods, it will affect our competitors adversely.\nAndrew Kligerman: Lastly, our Commercial Lines, you noted in the letter that it was a remarkable 63% growth since their optimism that you can continue to grow in the double-digits. And what would give you that optimism?\nTricia Griffith: Well that process significant for a couple of different reasons. So we did grow a double-digits in all of our business marketing carriers, and still are growing significantly in FHT in us for-hire transportation based on still amount. So not good being moved across the countries since the pandemic. In addition to that, about half of that increase came from our transportation network renewals. So we had one of our partners, we went from 6 months to 12-month policies, so that obviously is significant. We increased our projected mileage which is how we compute our premium. So that was part of the increase.  We had rate increases to reflect the inflationary environment and forth, we see this last for us reinsure, so about half that increase wasn't CNCs. So all that said, even if on the commercial that the BMTs that we have now, the five on commercial, even if they slowed down a little bit, the great part about what we've been doing, and you wrote about this, over the last several years, is thinking about the future. So we just are getting going on our BOP, our Business Owners Policy, small business continues to grow. There we have 37 new states are being rolled out and three new states are actually this year.  We have our fleet program where we've expanded the number of power units that we write from 10 to 40. We have the acquisition of protectors from medium to larger fleet. How we think about really, business in all -- at least, Horizon 1 and 2 for now, and ultimately, we will do that and Horizon 3, is, how do we continue to have growth even if maybe one segment of that business may slow down or may fluctuate based on macroeconomic conditions? So I'm excited about all the opportunities in Commercial Lines because we've spent the last four or five years investing in the future.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping that you could quantify what percent of premium per state's represents where you think the majority of rate increases behind you. And then, associated with that question, what gives you guys the confidence to make that statement about rate versus forward loss trend given there is just so much uncertainty still with both frequency and severity?\nTricia Griffith: I probably would dissect all these days, I would say, that we feel pretty positive that, one, we got ahead of competitors, which we think is important -- is a bit important in the past. And we're watching trends closely. I don't -- the crystal ball, I wish we had, would help us, but we'll watch those trends. We still are watching labor rates and some other indicators that could make us to take more rate. I think the beautiful part is we got out ahead of rate that -- our hope is that the rate we take, if we need to, in some states will be less -- will be the smaller bites of the apple that we like to take.  We obviously couldn't do it in this environment because the trends were so dramatically increased. But we think there is a few states we're working on. We think that the majority of the rate actions are behind us, and what we're really thinking about now is when we can pull the trigger on some of that growth. And Pat, and John, and I sit down with the controller from Personal Lines very frequently to talk about return to profit and return to growth, in that order. And what we're looking at is literally state-by-state, channel-by-channel in the auto book and say, okay, if April results come out here, could we reduce underwriting restrictions? Could we open up a little bit of the local marketing? And I talked in my opening comments about how we have the ability to do so in each segment, in each market because of the way we buy media. So it's a complicated question, and there's 50 shades of this and actually a 100 because of the channels and that we're working closely to figure out when to do that. But we feel confident, and of course we had that 7 points to earn in, so more will come to the story, but we're watching things closely.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, as you've gone through this environment, have you guys noticed any change with your Snapshot and the take-up on your UBI products, and then has there been any change in discounts that you guys have offered are or the time period on -- that you guys are observing with your products?\nTricia Griffith: We saw initially a pretty big increase in the take rate and the agency channel, which has been a challenge with us. So right now we sit at about 40% take rate on the direct channel, about 10% in the agency channel, and this of course is excluding California and North Carolina where we can't use telematics. So that blended amount is about 28% take rate. We continue -- we have surcharges and discounts and of course, participation discount, and we continued to learn from those and really try to make sure that ultimately we try to price to the whole curve. And that's so we will continue to do as our Snapshot evolves.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: I'm sorry. Can you talk about, I guess, earlier lessons learned from -- I guess it's been about a month end since you've gone continuous in one state, but takeaways from that, maybe what we can expect, if -- for that to be a national plan for you guys, one that could be the case. And then, just what does that mean for you? Well, if you do go national for that, what does it mean? Does it -- more accurate pricing and therefore, better loss ratios, better gross, just talk about what that means for you.\nTricia Griffith: It's literally been in one state, Oklahoma, for 30 days. We'll have to answer that question of how it's going on -- maybe next quarter or the quarter after that. We'd like to continue it because -- especially as we've thought about the pandemic, it more responsive in changed to driving behavior, and we think we can -- we know the costs have gone down overtime on both mobile and then [Indiscernible], and so we thought it was a good time. And we have high hopes that Oklahoma will be successful, and that we'll continue to roll that out once we have more data.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks. Second, totally unrelated question, what percent of your new customers -- when they come in the door, start off by going online and then end up switching from online to actually using a call center from you guys. And I'm wondering, is there any near-term opportunity you can take advantage of given the unit\u2019s funds from [Indiscernible] competitor, what they are doing with their [Indiscernible] cars?\nTricia Griffith: I think it's a pretty small percentage. It used to be much larger, but I think our technology has gotten so much more sophisticated that more people finished the buy online when they're there. It's a small percentage.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you, Tricia.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Phillips.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Gary, please go ahead.\nGary Ransom: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask about claims counts and claims personnel, and you've had a lot of growth on the commercial side. Maybe it's flat or but I wondered if you heard a little bit flatter on the first line side, but I wondered if you could talk to us about having the right people as things are changing rapidly. And if there's any difficulty in getting the staffing right there.\nTricia Griffith: And it's a great question. And over the year as we really spent a lot of time making sure that we think about centralization, and consolidation and having the right file with the right representative at the right time. And we took advantage of the slowdown when frequency plummeted during the beginning of the pandemic to do the same thing on the Commercial Lines side because is it such a different animal. On what I would say is turnover is up, especially with new hires. And we're seeing that game you're seeing across the industry and across with entry-level jobs.  That said, we've had this recruiting machine that is just amazing, and it has enabled us to really continue to hire at a rate that helps us to get out in front of our growth. So we want to make sure that people, are not just here, but they are trained and can do the right thing on behalf of our customers. I think one of the things that I am proudest of that we didn't do, was to reduce our claims for us during the pandemic, we were severely overstaffed for several months. And Mike Caesar, who was the client is President of time and I made the decision that we just couldn't do it, that we knew that this was for the country not for our company.  And that allowed us to have staff waiting and available when things picked up. So we're going to continue to hire in advance of need and benefit claims and CRM side. Make sure we have the right training in both the virtual and maybe sometimes in office environment. We also look at in this group reports to John [Indiscernible] our internal audit group looks at the quality of the files and we have seen continued good results in there in that.\nGary Ransom: For just Snapshot, I know you've talked on other times about using Snapshot stuff under the claims process as well. Have you --\nTricia Griffith: I -- you cut out, but I think what you're saying is we -- are you using that in the claims process. That's something we'll definitely consider as we think about continuance, we'll think about other services and claims could be one where we could actually help with the investigation should our customers have that Snapshot device.\nGary Ransom: So that's still a future thing you're looking at, nothing really happening now.\nTricia Griffith: We're testing all the time. That's what I would say.\nGary Ransom: Got it. Thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh, your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you. During the re-pricing and marketing rationalization. The policy count growth in Progressive property was still fairly healthy. I'm going to guess that you're not terribly interested in insuring someone's home, they're not often going to give you their cars. Can you talk a little bit about the different in hearings and retaining stems versus retaining Robinsons and getting new ones over the past nine months?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, thank you, Scott. I said -- so Sam's have always been defined as shoppers, and so they are very expensive. And so we know that our attention is going to be less when we crank up rates on the auto side, and that has proven to be true. And we've had less of a retention far in the Robinsons side. From the home perspective, we've been clear on our desire to de -risk and to get more of our nonvolatile storm states more in the 2/3 of our book versus the 50% it is now. This quarter we'll start to non-renew the policies that we talked about in Florida, about 60,000 policies over the next year.  And we continue to try to de -risk our portfolio. With property, it takes a little bit of time because there are 12-month policies, and it's also reflective of industry pricing. I think you've seen the storms that have happened in March and now again in April. A lot of it has to do with growth. Could be that right now, it's still a competitive market because everyone has increasing rates. But we're going to continue to increase rates and try to stay ahead of that trend and to de -risk our book a bit.\nJosh Shanker: So net of the Florida non-renewals, obviously you're growing in 47 other states with fairly desirous appetites. Should we feel that the deceleration and policy count growth overall for property, or do you think that those two things neutralize each other and it will be hard for us, from our perspective, to be able to see that going through the numbers?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, our desire is to grow in the non-volatile state, so we're taking actions to do so with more agents that are able to sell our property book. So it's hard to say. Again, that'll be relative to what our competitors do. And in addition, I talked a little bit in my opening comments about our increased use of deeper segmentation in the property products. We believe we have industry-leading segmentation auto side where our R&D departments were closely together to get that same level of segmentation in homes. I think that'll be really important.  And in many of the states that -- we still have a decent amount of policies and we've been able to have higher deductibles, have cost sharing. And so that -- this was not treated as a maintenance policy that -- just wait for that hailstorm to come and we'll replace your roof. And so those are some of the other things that we've changed. I can't really look out into the future and know how we're going to grow in a non-volatile space, but that is our approach. And I think it will take some time.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. Thanks very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. So in your answers, you mentioned eventually returning to growth. And I'm want us to focus on the advertising piece of that. Your advertising spend is down in the quarter or down year-over-year. And I'm just wondering whether you actually need the lowest price to win the customer or put it another way, does the brand Progressive get you to a customer when -- even if you don't have the lowest price and when will be advertising spigot be turned back on if most your rates increases are behind you?\nTricia Griffith: Oh, yeah. I do think our brand would have us win in the marketplace and doesn't always have to be this lowest rate, especially for people that have had experiences with us. I remember years ago, when I ran claims, we had really high NPS for those people that had claims because of the way we treated them when they needed us most. So yeah, I think that makes sense. And when we look at the difference between agency and direct, as far as PLE, we see that Direct has gone down a lot, and we think that has to do with some brand. So what Pat and I talked about is really state-by-state, and we'll do some sensitivity analysis of if we turn on local marketing by X Amount X plus X plus, what we think could happen to new apps, etc.  We will only do that if we're sure we're in the position to start that growth again. So we are as anxious as anyone. We did not like having new business app negative. We want to grow. We want to grow as fast as we can, but again, profit is one of our core values, and that will trump growth. But let me tell you, these conversations are happening every day, and when we turn it on, we will feel all pretty confident that we're in a good position to do so. Of course, things can change, and we'll always be -- we have to be nimble with those changes, and we we'll be able to do that based on the data that we look at literally daily.\nGreg Peters: My second question, I wanted to pivot you. You talked about rolling out the new homeowners\u2019 product. Can you just step back and tell us a little bit about that product and what differentiates from what you were offering before?\nTricia Griffith: I'll let Pat say that.\nPat Callahan: Yeah. Happy to talk about that. So part of the segmentation that we need to enhance in the property side of the business is on the age of the home and the age of the roof primarily. And we've just got better segmentation that we're bringing in as we expand that product over time, there's also some coverage expansion that agents have asked for, but primarily it's understanding the risk better and recognizing that the majority of our losses are coming from damage to the roof on that home and capturing both the age of the roofs and or the age of the home or in most cases, both, helps us better rate and better underwrite.\nGreg Peters: And just as a follow-up to that answer, does that mean that the older the roof that you're -- is there a depreciation schedules that you're applying allowing the customer to buy out for roof placement? I am just trying to understand how that fits with what some of your competitors are offering in the marketplace.\nPat Callahan: Yes, it certainly varies by state what we can offer. And when we talk about a market like Florida that limits our ability to price a depreciated roof accurately. That's one of the challenges that we see in a market like Florida, but we do offer a depreciation or effectively a roof depreciation schedule for customers, so they're not, I guess, incentivized to have that roof replaced when it's old and there's damage to it.\nGreg Peters: Okay. Thanks for the answers.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden from ethical. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Tricia, you had said you believe that the major auto rate increases are behind you and obviously looking to turn on the growth. I guess, just saying that the major auto rate increases are behind you. We still have 7 points of rate that's going to earn in over the course of the rest of '22, how should we think about the auto loss ratio? And when that will start to stabilize and eventually improved, do you think that's a second half of '22 event or how are you thinking about that?\nTricia Griffith: That's follow-up and data. So we watched as the rates earn into the loss ratio, and we have a couple of big states where we were able to get rate pretty quickly in on mainly, Texas and Florida. And so those are two big states for us. And so we'll watch those states closely to see when we think it's the right time to grow. And again, we're watching all the macroeconomic factors that are going into the inflationary pressures specifically with collision and property damage to make sure those down continued to increase. I think of labor rates and items like that's the will watch those close to make sure we have the right amount of rates to start the growth.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess just -- thinking about, maybe, on that last point, just some of the severity factors in trends that you're observing throughout the course of the first quarter and then also your outlooks, could you maybe break down how you guys are thinking about used car prices as well as -- labor is one that you mentioned and the outlook on those items as we move forward from here?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we've launched we watched the Manheim Index pretty closely, and even though there is a couple of data points that say it's flattened or maybe even gone down, it's still 35% higher than January of 2021. So there hasn't been a step function change and a drop in used car prices. In addition, we know accidents are happening at a higher rate of speed, so there's more damage. We know that parts are up over 12%. Labor is only being up a couple of percentage points. We're watching that closely just because of watching the unemployment environment and how tough it is to hire in the industry and tax in the industry.  And then, because of body shop capacity, we're also seeing rental car extensions of several days. And so all those things go in some play when we think about severity on both collision and PD, and that's why they're higher. I feel pretty good and pretty stable on the BI side. In the last four quarters, it's been in the 6% to 8% range. We'll continue to watch that. We have -- we've seen a little bit of a turning rep rate, increase some of the general damages, which are the non-medical damages increase. But we feel that that's, at least, stabilized over four quarters, but we'll watch that, of course. But those are the big drivers that go into the extreme severity trends in collision and PD.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And the follow-up, when you say that you're ready to move potentially to more growth, and your rates, you feel like most of them are behind you, what is the severity view that you're making into that statement?\nTricia Griffith: The severity view? I think we're just looking to see if we can -- the severity will be what it'll be in terms of what's happening from an inflationary perspective, so we're just pricing to that, and when we believe we can make our calendar year and lifetime target mark -- as the profit margins will start to grow.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's important to recognize a lot of these decisions are made locally, so we are product managers who are responsible for geography and products, and they are obviously adjusting rates with their view and the pricing team's view of future loss trends. They take the rates up. And while they are fairly confident that the projections are right, normally, you are going to want to see some results come in before you open up the [Indiscernible] on new business side. That said, there are -- in geographies now where we have done that.  But there are also a lot of geographies where we have either not gotten the rate we need, such as some of the large states we mentioned earlier or we're still a bit tentative on understanding if we have taken enough rate such that we can open up the [Indiscernible]. So it really is a day-to-day [Indiscernible] geography level decision on when to turn advertising back on, when to loosen the underwriting. But again, I think one of the strengths we have is that team of product managers who are considering everything locally and making the best call, again, on a day-to-day basis. So it's not something we can predict at the aggregate level. It's going to come down the state level decisions, and we're confident we are going to be making right ones in each state at the right time.\nDavid Motemaden: Understood. Thanks so much for your time.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. And good morning. Excuse me. I was just curious with the situation in Eastern Europe and Russia. Seems like some of the European OEMs have had some supply chain issues. Are you seeing that impact in maybe U.S. manufacturers or priced of cars, used cars, parts or the like?\nTricia Griffith: Not really. We see the same sort of bottlenecks in supply chain with kits that happened before what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine, and so there's still some supply issues there, especially with new cars and that has of course increased used car prices, but that was prior to this.\nYaron Kinar: Right. Okay. And then I think one of the comments you made around homeowners is that your ability to grow is going to depend on the competitive environment. Can you maybe talk about how you see the competitive environment in homeowners outside of the Southeastern Florida?\nTricia Griffith: That's also state-by-state as well because if you got west there's issues in terms of fires, etc. So I think we look at each day, look at proclivity to have a major weather events. Understand our segmentation more deeply. And then we will look around. It's a competition on both direct and agency side, so we've got not just the agency side where we sell Progressive home against some of the captives or bigger players. But we also have the Direct side where we have the opportunity to have Progressive Home as well as many unaffiliated partners. And so we have some advantage to get Robinsons, they're not always on our paper as well. But we look across the country, try to get -- we're trying to get to the more non-volatile states. We believe when we look at our results against the industry and non-weather in those states, we're very competitive.\nUnidentified Analyst: And we have great and broad distribution network in those non-volatile states that are quite committed to Progressive as a company they use in their offices. So our independent agents across those non-volatile states ensure a lot of Robinsons. So we have access to a lot of that business, and we're going to spend more time going after it. I know you excluded Florida in the south [Indiscernible] in the question, but it's really important that there are solutions in those states that are viable for consumers and the industry.  And it has been very challenging in some of those environments, and so we're working with regulators and legislators to find solutions because Florida, specifically, right now is a very disruptive market. Pat was talking about the liability of depreciating a roof from Florida. It -- you must offer a full replacement value on your roof in Florida. So it's very difficult to find solutions for homes that have older roofs, that are not up to code. So we hope to, obviously, growing in the non-volatile states. We also hope for solutions in some of those cap current states that are, again, amenable to both consumers and the industry.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tracy vendor AG from Barclays. Tracy your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Good morning. Before declaring victory [Indiscernible] with the exception [Indiscernible] I'm wondering if you're seeing favorable seasonality in the first quarter, like others are talking about. And if so have you taken that into account when you say the majority of your rate increases are behind you?\nTricia Griffith: I think our seasonality has been relatively stable as it has been in the past. I'm not saying we're winning, Tracy. What we're saying is that we believe we got out in front of our competitors with rate from the data that we look at. We're watching trends very closely. A lot of caveats to that. And all we're saying is that with the rate we have from last year and the rate that we have on the street. We believe we're well-positioned. Again, lots of caveats on making sure that we have enough and that we can grow in turn on that local media. So and maybe in a quarter or two we can have a different conversation helpful, but right now we're still tentative, but we wanted to just give some color on the fact that we're really proud of our rate-making machine and that we're able to get out in front of that despite a lot of headwinds.\nTracy Benguigui: I hear your optimism, but I'm also just wondering, in some states, are you just simply reaching your maximum limit you think regulators will allow you to take, or in theory, you'd choose to take more rate you could do so?\nTricia Griffith: We look at the data, and we look at perspective rates in terms of what we're seeing in trends. And if we need more, even states where we have already increased rates several times, we will share the actuarial data to get the right rate, to get to our profit target margin. And that's how we've always worked. And I think regulators are thinking about their constituents because of all the other inflationary pressures. But this industry has been very clear. It needs rate -- has needed rate for some time since last year. And now we feel good that we're starting to get it in many of our larger states.  So I'm just optimistic because we were able to have great conversations, great relationships in a couple of key states and many states across the board with key regulators where they get it. They see the data. They understand it, and they know the worst thing you can do is not give the rate because then, you're not going to have insurance available for their constituents and ultimately, you're going to have to get the rate. So it's going to be, over time, there will be bigger rates in the future. So I think that's how it works. And so I am very optimistic.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And I know you make local decisions but to any extent, are you taking any cross states up to dates like higher rates of states where you have success to make up for inadequacies in states like California?\nTricia Griffith: No. We have a very specific goal of not subsidizing and to have every one of our products in aggregate common to our 96 combined ratio goal.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. I'm sorry, just really quick, you mentioned is 20% take-up in telematics. Is that for new business only? If not what percentage of your in-force uses telematics?\nTricia Griffith: The 28% is in-force. It's no -- new. I'm sorry, new. 40% new in direct, 10% new in agency, yeah. Are we going to report [Indiscernible] I'm sorry?\nTracy Benguigui: Sorry. What would it be for your in-force, which is a lot larger than your new business.\nTricia Griffith: I think we are saying we don't share that.\nTracy Benguigui: Oh, you don't share that. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks. Tracy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian, your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. John, first one for you. Just curious. Where do you knew money yields stand right now as of today versus your kind of book yield on your fixed income portfolio and maybe perhaps you could give us just a general sense of how much of your portfolio roles every 12 months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. I'll take that one. So --\nBrian Meredith: Okay.\nUnidentified Analyst: -- I don't like to give too specific, but I would think in broad swaths, if you look at March, 2022, in terms of where investments were, inclusive of treasuries, there was about 2.5% and taking that out on either side of 3%. Generally, if you think about a portfolio with a three-year duration and our size, I would think about it every 12 months, anywhere from $6 billion to $8 billion of that portfolio rolling off.\nBrian Meredith: Great, really helpful. And then, second question, I'm just curious, Tricia, would you care to speculate or tell us -- give us some sense of when you think California will actually start granting rate increases?\nTricia Griffith: Well, Brian, if I knew the answer to that -- we're -- all I can say is we're working --\nBrian Meredith: [Indiscernible]\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, we're working with the regulators and doing all that we can because we want to be able to open up, and we want to be able to have affordable, available insurance for California and just -- most populous state, we'd love to grow there, and we'll do what we can to do so.\nBrian Meredith: Great. I mean, is there -- I'm -- but just curious, is there amount of time that you're willing to wait to get those rate increases? Are you taking pretty -- some pretty significant none underrating actions here to improve results right now?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. We're taking very significant non-rate actions because of the inability to get the rate. And obviously we will work with the regulators to figure out the best thing to do for our mutual constituents and we just need to continue to do so.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Can I ask one more quick one. I'm just curious. PLE continue to drop pretty significantly. Is that reflective of what exchange in business mix or is that just the pricing environment? Just maybe remind us exactly what that PLE reflects.\nTricia Griffith: It really does reflect the pricing environment. And I talked a little bit about the difference in agency and direct with agency being a little bit more elastic. And when we look at PLEs, Texas and Florida, they obviously don't drop as dramatically, which would tell you it's pricing because we got out in those two big states pretty early. I think that our holy grail is retention, but we also have to be priced right.  And we also noticed some consumers are trying to figure out, can they change their coverages or do things differently or as Snapshot and things like that to reduce their prices. So I know in our CRM organization we continue to try to grow what we call our customer preservation teams. So if they call in and they are challenged to pay their bill because of increases. Can we work with them on bill plans, on coverage to make sure they are obviously still covered, but to get them the right rate in order for them to stay? But it is it is reflective on the majority with prices.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just to reiterate a couple of parts made earlier in response to that question. We do see different use to study bear consumer segments. So on the more preferred end, less elastic and more non-standard or Sanmen far more elastic. So that obviously plays itself through. And for the change. Additionally, as Tricia noted earlier, we do see a difference by channel. So some of that's because our agents have access to other markets and light proactively shop. But we also think there's some brand benefits. So we do see less degradation in the direct channel than we do in the agency channel.\nBrian Meredith: Very helpful. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, [Indiscernible]\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead with your question.\nAlex Scott: Thanks. First one I had is just on the Personal Auto NPW growth. I think high level when we try to triangulate the PIF growth you're getting in the rate. NPW growth isn't showing as much of the rate flowing through as I would've expected. I'm just interested if there's any makeshift or something affecting that or if there's any nuances to that that I should be considering.\nTricia Griffith: Probably point to average written premium growth with the pricing increases coming in. And I think that's reflective of our new business growth in overall growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: A couple of other comments on that. We did mention we still have seven points of rate to earn in, in our Personal Auto programs, so some of the rate we've taken has not yet affected the policies. We report the written premium change, so the earnings will affect combined ratio, more so down the road. But if you look at the change in new average written premium versus renewal, you'll see renewal is up significantly more. So as we take revisions that are predominantly base rate revisions, those will flow through directly to all our renewal customers.  On the new business side, people shop, so we won't see all that average written premium benefit for new customers perhaps at any time when we are taking rates up. So there are some timing issues there, but we're also cognizant of the new renewal mix and how that flows through in terms of the total average premiums. We think the rate we're taking is definitely earning into the book. It's being accepted by consumers actually at a little higher rate than we've seen historically, which is also reflected. We think of the market conditions. So we think the actions we're taking are absolutely resulting in the outcomes we're expecting.\nAlex Scott: Got it, and thank you. And second I had been just on competition. You talked about some of the advantages you have in your sophistication with the ad spend, and I'm just interested if you've seen anything as we've gone through the pandemic, which I think was a bit of a wake-up call to some of the more brick-and-mortar type distribution companies. Are you seeing more competition there? Are you able to execute that strategy to the same degree you've been able to in the past, even just thinking beyond where pricing is at the moment and how it appears near-term?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I would direct you back to our four strategic pillars that we talk about all the time we make sure we invest in all the time and I have seen our strength there. So the first one is our people and our culture are our most important competitive advantage. So during the pandemic, we have really made sure that we are connecting even, if it's the virtual to our employees, like continue to do every new hire class. I am out and about virtually and now more in-person, but people and culture are really important. And it's important for people to feel good about being on a winning team. The second we've talked about a lot is our brands.  So we're going to continue to invest in our brands and have some really great creative coming out end of this month or early June. And then of course, competitive prices, we've been talking about that for the last hour, we want to get to where we're really competitive. Some part of that is getting the right rates. But it's also that continuation of our superior segmentation and making sure that we care deeply about expenses. So we continue to create expense goals for the future. And then lastly, and John have brought this up, is our broad coverage, so we're going to continue to be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And I think that's the key. So regardless of the people entered independent agency channel or the direct channel, we've been in both for a long time, we appreciate both. We appreciate the fact that consumers have a choice that if they want to buy on their phone, their iPad, through an agent, through 1-800 Progressive, and we're going to be there as they change, especially if we've invested more in business closed floor on the commercial side of HomeQuote Explorer. So all those four strategic pillars really worked hand and glove to make sure that we stay competitive. I feel really great about our position in both channels and how we think about the future.\nAlex Scott: Okay thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\n\ufeffQ - Meyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Great. Thanks so much. Tricia, in your -- [Indiscernible] earlier question, you talked about the returns profit proceeding, the return to growth in conversations with controller. Is that to a monthly basis or is that a full year? In other words, if you are priced adequately, but having earned in all the rate increases that are in the market now, will that constrain growth?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah, we'll look at timing of when to start, when you ramp up some local advertising. Remember, we haven't shut off our national advertising, so it's not like our brand isn't out there, so we still have some ability to grow. But yeah, we'll look at the pivotal time or right time of when we should start that growth, making sure that the rates in each particular state are adequate for us to reach our target profit margins.\n\ufeffQ - \ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Okay. But there's some monthly combined ratio pressure because of lower prior rate. That's not an impediment to growth?\nTricia Griffith: I don't understand you.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, we're obviously managing through a calendar year, '96 or better, so we have that as an objective function for sure, as do big product managers. But if they've taken rates up to where they think the lifetime combined ratio for new customers they are writing is adequate, they will likely air towards growing more. There is the consideration of the calendar year combined ratio for sure as well, but generally, if they think the new business customers they're writing today are adequately priced over their lifetime, they will be happy to go for growth.\n\ufeffQ - \ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I apologize for not expressing the question well. Second question, on price sensitivity, is that heightened across various customer segments when overall in place in outside of car insurance is elevated?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. Not really sure if we know that. But I think what John was saying too, in terms of elasticity, our renewals are improving on the elasticity side, which tells us that and we do histogram on decreases or increases, to a certain percentage or buckets of percentages. And we're seeing more people even if they are shopping, they're staying when they get their renewal, which likely means they can't find a better rate. That's the only thing we can look at. What's in data, but it's hard to say with all of the economics is going on in the country.\n\ufeffQ -\ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Looking perfect. Thanks so much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, Meyer.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on operating within Progressive's constraints. So the plan, historically, has always been doing 96 or better and grow as fast as you can. The vast majority of the time, growth is easy because you got usually close to the 96. But whenever you've gotten kind of closer to 96, like the second half of last year, it's been focused on re-underwriting, focused less on growth, all that. I guess I'm just curious -- and you did that before you're even at a 96, but we're getting there. So after having gone through the first quarter when you've been -- and again, somewhere running 94 on a group basis and above a 96 in personal auto, is it safe to say that you have the same risk appetite that you did later in 20 -- later last years?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean, I think our standard and our operating policy hasn't changed. And remember for reporting and 94.5%, we're still looking at perspective rates and we're looking at trends, that will be future over 96% if we don't do some. So the data is in a moment in time we're looking at rate need ahead of time to make sure that we put that good business on the books for both a calendar year, '96 and a lifetime '96, I think those constraints, as you call them, I mean, I think I'd call them just our operating plans have worked well over the years. And in fact, the first time we talked about '96 was in our annual report, 1971 and when we went public.  And it's worked really well for us. If you look at our long-term trend, it's nice to have that Governor, it helps keep us disciplined around our pricing, helps keep us disciplined around our expense philosophy. And it has built us to the number three, and our Personal Auto carrier. And I can tell you when I started in 1988, we were nowhere there, so we will continue with that of course '96 is in the aggregate, so it doesn't mean that obviously our new business on the direct side wouldn't come in at a '96 and there's other areas where we aggregate are up to the 96. And I think it's been a great winning business model.\nRyan Tunis: That's clear. My follow-up was just on retention. So retention has continued to actually hold up a lot better than I would have expected. And you're seeing how much rate you implemented in the first quarter. Yes, I was just maybe wondering some clarity of what you've implemented and how much has actually been -- I mean, showing you the customers that was that mainly on first-quarter, but I'm just trying to think of like maybe that might be somewhat of a tailwind headed in the second quarter.\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think it depends on if you're looking at the trailing three or trailing 12. I think trailing three as more responsive to our rate increases. And so like I'd started to say before, we saw early results with our retention in some of the states where we took increases more quickly. When could still seeing a little bit of degradation again, a lot of that is relative to what our competition is doing. So if you're getting your renewal and you're stopping and rates are going up. And again, that's why we tried to get ahead of rate.  Because if we can be stable, which is what consumers want and they go to shop and now it's much more increased with our competitors, they're going to stay with us then of course, the new business we've been talking about for a while. So we keep a close eye on retention, especially because we've been really proud of the work we've done today over the many, many years. But we'll watch that closely and do everything in our power to keep our customers that we've taken so much to acquire.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nDoug Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Emily, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor Event. Information of actual replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for next year. You may now disconnect.",

We have grown from a scrappy startup trying to find a foothold in the great depression to the tenth largest homeowners carrier, the third largest personal auto carrier, and the Number 1 commercial auto carrier. In just the last five years, our total company-wide written premium has nearly doubled.  Nowhere has growth been more remarkable than in Commercial Lines, which just passed the major milestone of over $9 billion in written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis. We grew commercial auto premiums over 200% in the last five years all while generally achieving a better than average industry profit margin and ended March just shy of $1 million, Commercial Line's policies enforced. It has truly been an incredible run with significant opportunities still waiting to be captured.  Congratulations to the Commercial Lines team, and thank you to all Progressive's employees and customers who have made the last 85 years so extraordinary. Throughout our 85-year history, we've have worked through many hard and soft markets, and we continue to address the hard market we're in today. While some indices suggest the value of used vehicle does leveling or even beginning to decline, used vehicle values are still significantly above those of early 2021. Steady but increasing trend in bodily injury severity has also contributed to the increase in loss cost we've experienced.  Further as a country emerge from the Omicron wave. We saw Personal Auto vehicle miles traveled recover to fourth-quarter 2021 levels, which were in the 9% to 10% range below the pre -pandemic baseline. Our response to these trends have been to reduce marketing expenses, increase underwriting scrutiny, limits bill plan options. And in the first quarter, we implemented rate increases of 7 points in Personal Auto that still in to earn in, which is an addition to the eight points we expecting 2021.  While we're making progress, we still have more work to do to ensure all of our states reach rate adequacy. Our rate and non-rate actions have had the expected effect on Personal Auto growth. While Personal Lines PPIF growth is still positive on a year-over-year basis, sequential PPIF growth is negative. New applications are down year-over-year, and a policy life expectancy is also declining. When we look across all the metrics we track, it seems likely that we're ahead of our competitors and increasing rates, which explains a large part of our slowdown in growth.  As we look forward to the rest of 2022 we're optimistic. As more states reach rate adequacy, we expect to be able to increase marketing spend and re-engage the growth engine. Because of the advantages we believe we have and the way we buy media, we can adjust marketing spend at the local and segment level and in such a way to ensure the new business we write meets our economic goals. And since we believe we are ahead of the competitors in taking right actions, we hope to continue our long-term trend of writing more than our fair share of clubs.  Even as we face these macroeconomic pressures, we have not slowed our pursuit of segmentation superiority. Our U.S. Personal Auto product model is now available in over eight -- in over half the states and is showing early promising results, especially among more preferred segments. We have also further expanded the footprint of our 4.1 homeowners' product into four additional states in the first quarter bringing the total to 12. Our new normal since the onset of the pandemic has been disruptions in the economy that has buffeted our business. While there are many paths, the future can take, I'm confident in our strategy and our people and believe our greatest successes are still to come in the next 85 years. Thank you. I will take your questions. We still have some challenges in a few states, including the one you mentioned, and we're working closely with regulators to get the rates that we need. Our desire is to be able to be more open, to open up our bill plan options, to open up or to loosen our underwriting restrictions. And once we get that rate, we can start to have that growth engine move. So we've got a couple of states that we're still working with -- a couple of big states that we've had some success in and why we feel pretty optimistic about the future. Specifically, in California, it's a little bit how they look back versus perspective. And so I think the data is showing that these are real trends -- inflationary trends, and the need across the industry is very significant, and we want to be open for Californians, and we'll work closely with the regulators. So let's make that happen. I don't know if there was a huge benefit. Things open up a little bit more, but still vehicle miles traveled and frequency is still both on pre -pandemic levels or do you want to add anything on that. During the early period we did see vehicle miles' travel drop a little relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, we've seen that since return in March. So a very modest benefit, if any at all. I'll talk a little bit about our investing guidelines and then John Bowers and assigned John, if you want to add anything, let me now. We've had a line standing approach to our investing and that is, we don't want to target a certain book yields or level of investment and income for that matter. We want to earn the best risk adjusted rate of that we're showing on our portfolio. And most importantly, John's team, their most important job is to protect the balance sheet. That way the operating company can grow as profitably and as fast as possible. John, do you want to add anything? Yeah. Andrew, first of all, I enjoyed your write-up last week. Welcome to P&C Insurance. And -- Yeah. And we have a couple of different underwriting restrictions. So we look at -- we'll look at gathering additional data, possibly, if we have more questions on a customer. So we call it pre -binding verification. So we may ask a little more specifics to make sure we have the [Indiscernible] adjust right and -- things like that. Do you want to add anything, Pat? I think it's more of the entering in and getting the right rate at inception. So we've had a higher percentage of customers that once we have the additional information, we have blocked and they've likely gotten somewhere else because we don't have the accurate information. Probably, I would say of incoming close, probably double-digit low. Low double digits which is from half that when we were more comfortable with underwriting margin. So what we're trying to do here is ensure that every piece of new business coming in the door is going to be profitable for us. We understand that there is a distribution or on our pricing. So on the tail where we're less sure that we are going to make money, that is where we're going to ask a lot more questions and frequently those questions lead to the customer seeking insurance elsewhere. That has more frequently the outcome than an adjustment in the overall premium because frankly, some customers are looking to achieve a lower premium by not answering the questions accurately. So some of these efforts are focused on that segment. By pushing that segment to our competitors, obviously, we ensure that we're profitable. And to the extent our competitors do not employ such methods, it will affect our competitors adversely. Well that process significant for a couple of different reasons. So we did grow a double-digits in all of our business marketing carriers, and still are growing significantly in FHT in us for-hire transportation based on still amount. So not good being moved across the countries since the pandemic. In addition to that, about half of that increase came from our transportation network renewals. So we had one of our partners, we went from 6 months to 12-month policies, so that obviously is significant. We increased our projected mileage which is how we compute our premium. So that was part of the increase.  We had rate increases to reflect the inflationary environment and forth, we see this last for us reinsure, so about half that increase wasn't CNCs. So all that said, even if on the commercial that the BMTs that we have now, the five on commercial, even if they slowed down a little bit, the great part about what we've been doing, and you wrote about this, over the last several years, is thinking about the future. So we just are getting going on our BOP, our Business Owners Policy, small business continues to grow. There we have 37 new states are being rolled out and three new states are actually this year.  We have our fleet program where we've expanded the number of power units that we write from 10 to 40. We have the acquisition of protectors from medium to larger fleet. How we think about really, business in all -- at least, Horizon 1 and 2 for now, and ultimately, we will do that and Horizon 3, is, how do we continue to have growth even if maybe one segment of that business may slow down or may fluctuate based on macroeconomic conditions? So I'm excited about all the opportunities in Commercial Lines because we've spent the last four or five years investing in the future. I probably would dissect all these days, I would say, that we feel pretty positive that, one, we got ahead of competitors, which we think is important -- is a bit important in the past. And we're watching trends closely. I don't -- the crystal ball, I wish we had, would help us, but we'll watch those trends. We still are watching labor rates and some other indicators that could make us to take more rate. I think the beautiful part is we got out ahead of rate that -- our hope is that the rate we take, if we need to, in some states will be less -- will be the smaller bites of the apple that we like to take.  We obviously couldn't do it in this environment because the trends were so dramatically increased. But we think there is a few states we're working on. We think that the majority of the rate actions are behind us, and what we're really thinking about now is when we can pull the trigger on some of that growth. And Pat, and John, and I sit down with the controller from Personal Lines very frequently to talk about return to profit and return to growth, in that order. And what we're looking at is literally state-by-state, channel-by-channel in the auto book and say, okay, if April results come out here, could we reduce underwriting restrictions? Could we open up a little bit of the local marketing? And I talked in my opening comments about how we have the ability to do so in each segment, in each market because of the way we buy media. So it's a complicated question, and there's 50 shades of this and actually a 100 because of the channels and that we're working closely to figure out when to do that. But we feel confident, and of course we had that 7 points to earn in, so more will come to the story, but we're watching things closely. We saw initially a pretty big increase in the take rate and the agency channel, which has been a challenge with us. So right now we sit at about 40% take rate on the direct channel, about 10% in the agency channel, and this of course is excluding California and North Carolina where we can't use telematics. So that blended amount is about 28% take rate. We continue -- we have surcharges and discounts and of course, participation discount, and we continued to learn from those and really try to make sure that ultimately we try to price to the whole curve. And that's so we will continue to do as our Snapshot evolves. Thanks, Elyse. It's literally been in one state, Oklahoma, for 30 days. We'll have to answer that question of how it's going on -- maybe next quarter or the quarter after that. We'd like to continue it because -- especially as we've thought about the pandemic, it more responsive in changed to driving behavior, and we think we can -- we know the costs have gone down overtime on both mobile and then [Indiscernible], and so we thought it was a good time. And we have high hopes that Oklahoma will be successful, and that we'll continue to roll that out once we have more data. I think it's a pretty small percentage. It used to be much larger, but I think our technology has gotten so much more sophisticated that more people finished the buy online when they're there. It's a small percentage. Thanks, Phillips. And it's a great question. And over the year as we really spent a lot of time making sure that we think about centralization, and consolidation and having the right file with the right representative at the right time. And we took advantage of the slowdown when frequency plummeted during the beginning of the pandemic to do the same thing on the Commercial Lines side because is it such a different animal. On what I would say is turnover is up, especially with new hires. And we're seeing that game you're seeing across the industry and across with entry-level jobs.  That said, we've had this recruiting machine that is just amazing, and it has enabled us to really continue to hire at a rate that helps us to get out in front of our growth. So we want to make sure that people, are not just here, but they are trained and can do the right thing on behalf of our customers. I think one of the things that I am proudest of that we didn't do, was to reduce our claims for us during the pandemic, we were severely overstaffed for several months. And Mike Caesar, who was the client is President of time and I made the decision that we just couldn't do it, that we knew that this was for the country not for our company.  And that allowed us to have staff waiting and available when things picked up. So we're going to continue to hire in advance of need and benefit claims and CRM side. Make sure we have the right training in both the virtual and maybe sometimes in office environment. We also look at in this group reports to John [Indiscernible] our internal audit group looks at the quality of the files and we have seen continued good results in there in that. I -- you cut out, but I think what you're saying is we -- are you using that in the claims process. That's something we'll definitely consider as we think about continuance, we'll think about other services and claims could be one where we could actually help with the investigation should our customers have that Snapshot device. We're testing all the time. That's what I would say. Thanks, Gary. Yeah, thank you, Scott. I said -- so Sam's have always been defined as shoppers, and so they are very expensive. And so we know that our attention is going to be less when we crank up rates on the auto side, and that has proven to be true. And we've had less of a retention far in the Robinsons side. From the home perspective, we've been clear on our desire to de -risk and to get more of our nonvolatile storm states more in the 2/3 of our book versus the 50% it is now. This quarter we'll start to non-renew the policies that we talked about in Florida, about 60,000 policies over the next year.  And we continue to try to de -risk our portfolio. With property, it takes a little bit of time because there are 12-month policies, and it's also reflective of industry pricing. I think you've seen the storms that have happened in March and now again in April. A lot of it has to do with growth. Could be that right now, it's still a competitive market because everyone has increasing rates. But we're going to continue to increase rates and try to stay ahead of that trend and to de -risk our book a bit. Yes. I mean, our desire is to grow in the non-volatile state, so we're taking actions to do so with more agents that are able to sell our property book. So it's hard to say. Again, that'll be relative to what our competitors do. And in addition, I talked a little bit in my opening comments about our increased use of deeper segmentation in the property products. We believe we have industry-leading segmentation auto side where our R&D departments were closely together to get that same level of segmentation in homes. I think that'll be really important.  And in many of the states that -- we still have a decent amount of policies and we've been able to have higher deductibles, have cost sharing. And so that -- this was not treated as a maintenance policy that -- just wait for that hailstorm to come and we'll replace your roof. And so those are some of the other things that we've changed. I can't really look out into the future and know how we're going to grow in a non-volatile space, but that is our approach. And I think it will take some time. Thank you. Oh, yeah. I do think our brand would have us win in the marketplace and doesn't always have to be this lowest rate, especially for people that have had experiences with us. I remember years ago, when I ran claims, we had really high NPS for those people that had claims because of the way we treated them when they needed us most. So yeah, I think that makes sense. And when we look at the difference between agency and direct, as far as PLE, we see that Direct has gone down a lot, and we think that has to do with some brand. So what Pat and I talked about is really state-by-state, and we'll do some sensitivity analysis of if we turn on local marketing by X Amount X plus X plus, what we think could happen to new apps, etc.  We will only do that if we're sure we're in the position to start that growth again. So we are as anxious as anyone. We did not like having new business app negative. We want to grow. We want to grow as fast as we can, but again, profit is one of our core values, and that will trump growth. But let me tell you, these conversations are happening every day, and when we turn it on, we will feel all pretty confident that we're in a good position to do so. Of course, things can change, and we'll always be -- we have to be nimble with those changes, and we we'll be able to do that based on the data that we look at literally daily. I'll let Pat say that. Thanks. That's follow-up and data. So we watched as the rates earn into the loss ratio, and we have a couple of big states where we were able to get rate pretty quickly in on mainly, Texas and Florida. And so those are two big states for us. And so we'll watch those states closely to see when we think it's the right time to grow. And again, we're watching all the macroeconomic factors that are going into the inflationary pressures specifically with collision and property damage to make sure those down continued to increase. I think of labor rates and items like that's the will watch those close to make sure we have the right amount of rates to start the growth. Yes. So we've launched we watched the Manheim Index pretty closely, and even though there is a couple of data points that say it's flattened or maybe even gone down, it's still 35% higher than January of 2021. So there hasn't been a step function change and a drop in used car prices. In addition, we know accidents are happening at a higher rate of speed, so there's more damage. We know that parts are up over 12%. Labor is only being up a couple of percentage points. We're watching that closely just because of watching the unemployment environment and how tough it is to hire in the industry and tax in the industry.  And then, because of body shop capacity, we're also seeing rental car extensions of several days. And so all those things go in some play when we think about severity on both collision and PD, and that's why they're higher. I feel pretty good and pretty stable on the BI side. In the last four quarters, it's been in the 6% to 8% range. We'll continue to watch that. We have -- we've seen a little bit of a turning rep rate, increase some of the general damages, which are the non-medical damages increase. But we feel that that's, at least, stabilized over four quarters, but we'll watch that, of course. But those are the big drivers that go into the extreme severity trends in collision and PD. The severity view? I think we're just looking to see if we can -- the severity will be what it'll be in terms of what's happening from an inflationary perspective, so we're just pricing to that, and when we believe we can make our calendar year and lifetime target mark -- as the profit margins will start to grow. Thank you, David. Not really. We see the same sort of bottlenecks in supply chain with kits that happened before what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine, and so there's still some supply issues there, especially with new cars and that has of course increased used car prices, but that was prior to this. That's also state-by-state as well because if you got west there's issues in terms of fires, etc. So I think we look at each day, look at proclivity to have a major weather events. Understand our segmentation more deeply. And then we will look around. It's a competition on both direct and agency side, so we've got not just the agency side where we sell Progressive home against some of the captives or bigger players. But we also have the Direct side where we have the opportunity to have Progressive Home as well as many unaffiliated partners. And so we have some advantage to get Robinsons, they're not always on our paper as well. But we look across the country, try to get -- we're trying to get to the more non-volatile states. We believe when we look at our results against the industry and non-weather in those states, we're very competitive. I think our seasonality has been relatively stable as it has been in the past. I'm not saying we're winning, Tracy. What we're saying is that we believe we got out in front of our competitors with rate from the data that we look at. We're watching trends very closely. A lot of caveats to that. And all we're saying is that with the rate we have from last year and the rate that we have on the street. We believe we're well-positioned. Again, lots of caveats on making sure that we have enough and that we can grow in turn on that local media. So and maybe in a quarter or two we can have a different conversation helpful, but right now we're still tentative, but we wanted to just give some color on the fact that we're really proud of our rate-making machine and that we're able to get out in front of that despite a lot of headwinds. We look at the data, and we look at perspective rates in terms of what we're seeing in trends. And if we need more, even states where we have already increased rates several times, we will share the actuarial data to get the right rate, to get to our profit target margin. And that's how we've always worked. And I think regulators are thinking about their constituents because of all the other inflationary pressures. But this industry has been very clear. It needs rate -- has needed rate for some time since last year. And now we feel good that we're starting to get it in many of our larger states.  So I'm just optimistic because we were able to have great conversations, great relationships in a couple of key states and many states across the board with key regulators where they get it. They see the data. They understand it, and they know the worst thing you can do is not give the rate because then, you're not going to have insurance available for their constituents and ultimately, you're going to have to get the rate. So it's going to be, over time, there will be bigger rates in the future. So I think that's how it works. And so I am very optimistic. No. We have a very specific goal of not subsidizing and to have every one of our products in aggregate common to our 96 combined ratio goal. The 28% is in-force. It's no -- new. I'm sorry, new. 40% new in direct, 10% new in agency, yeah. Are we going to report [Indiscernible] I'm sorry? I think we are saying we don't share that. Thanks. Tracy. Well, Brian, if I knew the answer to that -- we're -- all I can say is we're working -- Yeah, we're working with the regulators and doing all that we can because we want to be able to open up, and we want to be able to have affordable, available insurance for California and just -- most populous state, we'd love to grow there, and we'll do what we can to do so. Yeah. We're taking very significant non-rate actions because of the inability to get the rate. And obviously we will work with the regulators to figure out the best thing to do for our mutual constituents and we just need to continue to do so. It really does reflect the pricing environment. And I talked a little bit about the difference in agency and direct with agency being a little bit more elastic. And when we look at PLEs, Texas and Florida, they obviously don't drop as dramatically, which would tell you it's pricing because we got out in those two big states pretty early. I think that our holy grail is retention, but we also have to be priced right.  And we also noticed some consumers are trying to figure out, can they change their coverages or do things differently or as Snapshot and things like that to reduce their prices. So I know in our CRM organization we continue to try to grow what we call our customer preservation teams. So if they call in and they are challenged to pay their bill because of increases. Can we work with them on bill plans, on coverage to make sure they are obviously still covered, but to get them the right rate in order for them to stay? But it is it is reflective on the majority with prices. Thanks, [Indiscernible] Probably point to average written premium growth with the pricing increases coming in. And I think that's reflective of our new business growth in overall growth. Yeah. I would direct you back to our four strategic pillars that we talk about all the time we make sure we invest in all the time and I have seen our strength there. So the first one is our people and our culture are our most important competitive advantage. So during the pandemic, we have really made sure that we are connecting even, if it's the virtual to our employees, like continue to do every new hire class. I am out and about virtually and now more in-person, but people and culture are really important. And it's important for people to feel good about being on a winning team. The second we've talked about a lot is our brands.  So we're going to continue to invest in our brands and have some really great creative coming out end of this month or early June. And then of course, competitive prices, we've been talking about that for the last hour, we want to get to where we're really competitive. Some part of that is getting the right rates. But it's also that continuation of our superior segmentation and making sure that we care deeply about expenses. So we continue to create expense goals for the future. And then lastly, and John have brought this up, is our broad coverage, so we're going to continue to be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And I think that's the key. So regardless of the people entered independent agency channel or the direct channel, we've been in both for a long time, we appreciate both. We appreciate the fact that consumers have a choice that if they want to buy on their phone, their iPad, through an agent, through 1-800 Progressive, and we're going to be there as they change, especially if we've invested more in business closed floor on the commercial side of HomeQuote Explorer. So all those four strategic pillars really worked hand and glove to make sure that we stay competitive. I feel really great about our position in both channels and how we think about the future. Thank you. Yeah, we'll look at timing of when to start, when you ramp up some local advertising. Remember, we haven't shut off our national advertising, so it's not like our brand isn't out there, so we still have some ability to grow. But yeah, we'll look at the pivotal time or right time of when we should start that growth, making sure that the rates in each particular state are adequate for us to reach our target profit margins.\n\ufeffQ - \ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Okay. But there's some monthly combined ratio pressure because of lower prior rate. That's not an impediment to growth? I don't understand you. Yeah. Not really sure if we know that. But I think what John was saying too, in terms of elasticity, our renewals are improving on the elasticity side, which tells us that and we do histogram on decreases or increases, to a certain percentage or buckets of percentages. And we're seeing more people even if they are shopping, they're staying when they get their renewal, which likely means they can't find a better rate. That's the only thing we can look at. What's in data, but it's hard to say with all of the economics is going on in the country.\n\ufeffQ -\ufeffMeyer Shields\ufeff\ufeff: Looking perfect. Thanks so much. Thank you, Meyer. Yeah. I mean, I think our standard and our operating policy hasn't changed. And remember for reporting and 94.5%, we're still looking at perspective rates and we're looking at trends, that will be future over 96% if we don't do some. So the data is in a moment in time we're looking at rate need ahead of time to make sure that we put that good business on the books for both a calendar year, '96 and a lifetime '96, I think those constraints, as you call them, I mean, I think I'd call them just our operating plans have worked well over the years. And in fact, the first time we talked about '96 was in our annual report, 1971 and when we went public.  And it's worked really well for us. If you look at our long-term trend, it's nice to have that Governor, it helps keep us disciplined around our pricing, helps keep us disciplined around our expense philosophy. And it has built us to the number three, and our Personal Auto carrier. And I can tell you when I started in 1988, we were nowhere there, so we will continue with that of course '96 is in the aggregate, so it doesn't mean that obviously our new business on the direct side wouldn't come in at a '96 and there's other areas where we aggregate are up to the 96. And I think it's been a great winning business model. Well, I think it depends on if you're looking at the trailing three or trailing 12. I think trailing three as more responsive to our rate increases. And so like I'd started to say before, we saw early results with our retention in some of the states where we took increases more quickly. When could still seeing a little bit of degradation again, a lot of that is relative to what our competition is doing. So if you're getting your renewal and you're stopping and rates are going up. And again, that's why we tried to get ahead of rate.  Because if we can be stable, which is what consumers want and they go to shop and now it's much more increased with our competitors, they're going to stay with us then of course, the new business we've been talking about for a while. So we keep a close eye on retention, especially because we've been really proud of the work we've done today over the many, many years. But we'll watch that closely and do everything in our power to keep our customers that we've taken so much to acquire. Thank you."

            "content": "I think that's exactly what we do, is when we want to be certain, we've got all the underwriting characteristics accurately reported, we will have some additional follow-up questions for customers, both at new business and then occasionally at renewal. Additionally, we will put restrictions on how open we are from a bill plan perspective and other things. Just as we look at overall profitability, we want to make sure we're getting the right rate for our new business customers at inception. Yeah. Happy to talk about that. So part of the segmentation that we need to enhance in the property side of the business is on the age of the home and the age of the roof primarily. And we've just got better segmentation that we're bringing in as we expand that product over time, there's also some coverage expansion that agents have asked for, but primarily it's understanding the risk better and recognizing that the majority of our losses are coming from damage to the roof on that home and capturing both the age of the roofs and or the age of the home or in most cases, both, helps us better rate and better underwrite. Yes, it certainly varies by state what we can offer. And when we talk about a market like Florida that limits our ability to price a depreciated roof accurately. That's one of the challenges that we see in a market like Florida, but we do offer a depreciation or effectively a roof depreciation schedule for customers, so they're not, I guess, incentivized to have that roof replaced when it's old and there's damage to it."

I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed statements related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we used the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Customer Relationship President, Lori Niederst, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Lori?\nLori Niederst: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Doug said, my name is Lori Niederst and I'm excited to be the first to participate in our new format. Traditionally, Tricia provides the opening comments for these presentations. But going forward, members of our leadership team will have the opportunity to speak to topics in our area of responsibility and introduce the talented individuals executing on these initiatives that we highlight during the event. In previous presentations, we've discussed our strategic pillars, which serve as the foundation of our vision. Today, we're focusing on one of those pillars, serving the broad needs of our customers. This pillar is synonymous with our strategy to become a destination company, providing products that meet our customers' changing needs throughout their lifetime. We seek to instill customer confidence in both the products and the prices that we offer. To set the stage for today's presentation, I thought it would be helpful to recap the history of Progressive's evolution as a destination company. Back in 2008, we publicly introduced our now ubiquitous customer segments, Sams, Dianes, Wrights, and Robinsons. In 2014, we first spoke of our destination strategy, stating our intention to invest in the products, services and experiences to better serve customers from all four segments. Since then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes, and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive, but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium. Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success. Even before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel, led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance. ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles as well as partner bundles to significantly increase our appeal to the rights in Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market, where we continue to be an industry leader. In 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers, and bundle with our Commercial Auto and BOP coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in Personal Auto with AutoQuote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com. This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with Home and Personal Auto, our Commercial Auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes Progressive underwritten Special Lines, Renters and Umbrella products. By expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business. The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one Progressive sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far reaching. The top line growth from increased sales of progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning. The more products the customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per policy acquisition costs. Fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share. But it's not just Progressive the benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners. Making this destination strategy, a win, win, win. It's important to note that today, we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts Progressive has undertaken we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn, and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers. While we're focusing on Direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce Kathryn Lemieux, a 42-year Progressive veteran and our Business Leader for CRM Sales Experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence. Our second speaker is Sean Freeman. Sean is a Business Leader of our Comparison Rating Experience and Direct Property Quoting, who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multi-product households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy.\nKathryn Lemieux: Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere. Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle, which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley, and together, they acquired Renters Insurance until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance. Both our Renters and Homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as live events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage. We would have loved to sell a Progressive manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them. So we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach. Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand building on our industry-leading digital tools and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier. This recipe is proving very successful delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade. Over the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from Property to Commercial Lines from one carrier to many from the phone to the online channel and from Quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online, using our HomeQuote Explorer or BusinessQuote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop by phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote and buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers. We introduced a Digital Multi-carrier Quote experience, which we call HomeQuote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduce new features to improve the quoter experience and the platform's efficiency. These efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a QuickQuote Experience, which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit. Leveraging our proprietary models, we customize prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20%, reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers. However, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our HomeQuote Explorer portfolio and nine for BusinessQuote Explorer. There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA, which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier. To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care. They must offer a quality product at a fair price, pass our information security assessments and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most. Additionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless integrated digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey for significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation or if they eventually need to ensure their teenage driver. Our agencies ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events. Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive Auto Insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than 1 million Robinsons we ensure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time. But even when the event isn't life changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we are presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options, which gives us the chance to retain the customer. Often, we are able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges such as the e-mail presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest running product comparison experience, Auto Insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California. Insurance products were much simpler in those days, so at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse engineered them from public filings. This industry altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates. Our early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency. If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you who's is? And challenging the status quo now what you'd expect from an insurance company as early brand differentiators. As Progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit, underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions. The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party. This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past five years, we've conducted dozens of tests leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase Progressive's conversion and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey AutoQuote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022. We launched a Quote and Buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations. We're ready to introduce the AQX Experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison quote and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere. Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates, but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance, while giving customers confidence in the products, prices, and providers that we offer. But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase and we continue to refine the benefit statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean?\nSean Freeman: Thank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it. I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this Destination Era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win-win-win strategy. As we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first. The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime. But beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice. Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies in addition to our own underwritten policies ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of the shopping experiences, with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts. Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own. Progressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business. So we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules in addition to our strong adherence to any provided procedures as of their appointed agencies. Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers. Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this Destination Era Strategy allows us to achieve greater top line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention and serves as a stable source of revenues complementary to our underwriting profits. As we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive. In doing so, we have seen a steady trend up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in Personal Lines, we can offer renters and/or home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy or in Commercial Lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs and in turn help us grow. Another important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately, how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers. Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation, and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences. Along with the previous slide, these top of funnel benefits are foundational to the win-win-win dynamic that I started with. As these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes. As highlighted in the last two slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers. The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least one rate for our consumer. This is not surprising, but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products such as homeowners. As a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return. While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive. Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime. We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive. Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship nine months longer on average as a result of this multi-carrier safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected retention of the original policy also dramatically improves. Across all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to 2x or more. It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a multicarrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers. Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive's offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com, our call centers as well as our appointed independent agents. This, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further. This starts the cycle all over again. As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cap risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly. This includes prominent risks such as weather and natural disasters. As agency compensation is really directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risk that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted, stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement. Our top line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive's underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation. Additionally, our success is penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments. The service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network. As the chart on the lower right demonstrates this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While it has not lost and made this as an Investor Relations call, and thus, the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs. Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progress through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or Life Insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely. Happily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe, make good on our win-win-win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency.\nDouglas Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Lori Niederst, Kathy Lemieux and Sean Freeman, who can answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. In order to get to as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks. The first question is regarding some of the commentary regarding kind of going back on the growth offensive given that profits are healed in a good chunk of your territories. So I guess on the last earnings call, I recall you alluded to growth likely being a little more subdued versus the beginning of '23 when you last one of the offenses. So I guess is that still the right way to think about things? Or any context around how you're thinking about growth, either by state or direct versus agency channel would be helpful?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Here's how we're thinking about growth right now, which is somewhat different and somewhat alike last year. So we went into 2023 feeling like we had the right rate in the system. Clearly, as the year unfolded, and we realized that inflations were still going up, so they hadn't abated, and we needed more rate. So our sole concentration last year was to get the right rate on the street. And we feel like we're in a really great position right now. So if you think about the overarching belief that we have the right rates in the system, and we believe we do now understand there's all the caveats about we don't have every state. We're still working with some states to get rate. But for the most part, we feel really good about our rate. This is how we're thinking about growth, really sort of the trifecta. So we have a continued hard market. Ambient shopping is still up. So we know our competitors are still getting rate. So those customers are shopping and we're able to get that at a really inexpensive acquisition cost. Then we also know that we're unraveling a lot of our non-rate actions, our underwriting actions. We talked about that a little bit in November, but we're going to continue to do that. And then really the third part of that trifecta is our ability to be able to spend a lot on media. So we are really excited about heading into 2024. Obviously, my whole theme for the annual report was uncertainty. So, or the letter I should say, is uncertainty. We feel much more certain and much more confident we will watch as the data unfolds, and we're pretty excited. The one caveat I would say, Mike, is when we're starting to look at first quarter of this year, versus first quarter of last year, you're going to see some really odd comparisons on new App growth. So we are growing new Apps like crazy last year. In fact, on the Direct Side, our new apps were up 93%. Overall, in Auto up, I think, like 83% or 82%. So huge comparisons if you're going to compare it to this quarter. So keep that in mind as this quarter closes, we believe it will smooth out over the year, but that's something we should just make a note of.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. My last follow-up is regarding your commentary about segmentation and continuous product model delivery is the term you also use in the letter. And I appreciate that it's probably, some of this is your special sauce and you might be, you want to be limited to how much you can say. But I'm curious, if we look at Progressive frequency and severities, but especially frequency over time. It tends to be better than the industry. I know there's different definitions. So you reminded us of frequency and severity, too? So we've got to be a little bit careful. But I Progressive still continues to do better than the industry on loss cost trends. Curious if you're willing to add any context about what what's driving the pricing segmentation? And is telematics a material kind of driver of you being able to do that? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean I think our continuous product model is our secret sauce. Over the years, I think we've sort of shared not in a lot of detail, but how, each model sort of adds segmentation and gets us to where we want, especially with the preferred customer. UBI is a big part of it and has been for a long time, and that will continue to be and why we're investing more and more into our latest product model, which is our continuous. I think with the Florida added this year, we're at about 70% continuous, and we're learning a lot from that. And we'll be able to do a lot for our customers as well. So maybe at some time when we do some of the deep dives, we can share a little bit more about how we think about our [indiscernible]. We're never going to share a secret sauce because that is just that. But we literally have our R&D departments working in both Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Property, nonstop, thinking about the next mode to just get that extra piece of data to understand how it correlates to loss costs.\nJohn Sauerland: I can also add that you're right. When you look over even decades, you see our frequency being more favorable than the industry and severity being somewhat similar to the industry. And Tricia noted what we believe are some of the key drivers, but we are also continuing to shift the mix of our business to more preferred customers who generally have lower claims frequency. So, it's hard to parse out exactly which piece of those frequency trends are the aforementioned, but we should note that we're also moving more and more to preferred and that will drive the frequency down as well.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBob Huang: Maybe just a follow-up on one of the comments that you made when you earlier talked about you plan to spend a lot on media to drive growth. Can you maybe help us understand like when you say a lot, like how should we think about it from just a modeling a forecasting perspective because, the way we think about it, obviously, there's going to be a lot of growth potential for Progressive. How should we think about the impact on expense ratio? And as well as what is a ballpark target that you're thinking about when you're normalizing expense back to a more historical level?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I would say back to more historical levels. We've had a couple, several rough years where we've had to pull back on media I mentioned that in my letter. They've been incredible. We have a media machine, a marketing machine and both are working really well, and we want to leverage that. We're not going to spend if we don't think it's efficient. When I talked about our growth in sort of the trifecta, we're getting a lot of ambient shopping still, and we'll continue to watch that. However, we think there's an opportunity to kind of open up the spigot and get more business in the door. We feel like we're in a really prime time now, especially with our rates. So while we're not going to share our full budget we believe we can spend assuming all things with our pricing is right and we get pricing and some rate in some of the states that we need, I think we'll be able to spend a tremendous amount to really leverage what we think could be a great growth year.\nBob Huang: Okay. That's very helpful. My second question, I think you addressed some of this in the prepared remarks. I just want to see if we can deep a little bit -- dig a little bit deeper into it is the broader competitive environment, and obviously, it seems like you made it very clear that you want to expand, especially in the off market, the bundled market Robinsons market, so to speak. But is there, can you maybe give us a more in-depth view on what are the competitors that are already in those position? What is the current environment look like for you to take share? Is it going to be in your view, much more difficult than before? Or is the current environment a much easier competitive dynamic for you to grab market share, especially within the Robinsons market?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think that has to do a lot with timing. So a lot of our competitors have increased rates as well pretty substantially. So there's a sort of a time frame. I don't know exactly when that is. But right now, we believe, we are able to take market share. Again, there'll be some, at some point, there'll be stable rates throughout the industry and there'll be less shopping. Really, the key for us in terms of market share will be to grab as much new business at or below our target market -- target profit. And really, the holy grail is retention and keeping those customers. So the key this year for us because we've had so many years of rate after rate is to have some stability for our customers. They deserve that. We want that. Of course, we'll watch the trends, and we'll have to react to those trends. But I'd like some stable rates because I think if we've got the new business coming in the door and then people staying with us, that is a huge win. And then, of course, Robinsons, we've continued to grow. We're excited about continuing to invest in our HomeQuote Explorer and the Progressive Advantage Agency. Working with great partners in that.\nBob Huang: Okay. Thank you very much. I think after all these years, we're all looking for comfortability. So thank you for that.\nTricia Griffith: Absolutely. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, hi there. Thank you for taking my question. My first question, given the growth the company has had over the last couple of years, can you talk about what economy of scale has done to the other expense ratio?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think any time you have an economies of scale, you'll be able to push down the expense ratio. We're always trying to balance out our expenses with investments and what the customers want. So digital and other things like that. So the bigger you get, I think the more you can, whether it's brand or expenses you can push on that, but we have been investing a lot in digital for our customers, and we'll continue to do that. One of our other pillars, and we talked about broad coverage today is competitive prices. And the two parts of competitive prices are really what we talked about a little bit earlier with Mike's question, that's segmentation having industry-leading segmentation. Understanding rate to risk. And the other is expenses. And we are constantly challenging ourselves to what's that right balance of investing, but getting those economies of scale. We'll continue to work on that for as long as I'm here for sure. And as long as John Sauerland is for sure.\nJohn Sauerland: Josh, sorry. As I think you know, we focus internally on what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio. So we talked a lot about media. We're always looking to optimize media relative to where we are in terms of rate adequacy and market opportunity on the non-acquisition expense ratio side, we're always looking to optimize costs. And of course, scale is a part of the way to do that. We have been successful in taking, if you look over the longer run, at least four points out of our cost structure on our non-acquisition expense ratio. Tricia mentioned, it's always a balance in investing and relative to the longer run, but we continue to expect to find opportunities to drive our non-acquisition expense ratio lower across all three of our businesses.\nJoshua Shanker: My other question at this point in the cycle where Progressive seems to be profitable and most of the competition is not. What does the marketplace look like for commissions right now? Both contingent commissions as well as base rate commissions?\nTricia Griffith: I can let Pat take that. I mean we, our commissions have been pretty stable and we have different structures depending on if we have a Platinum agent and some other programs we have with different agents I think, I don't want to speak too specifically to our competitors because they also ebb and flow.\nPat Callahan: Yes. We've definitely seen competitors use commission cuts as a profitability or margin restoration lever. And we haven't done that. So we've maintained our commission. We do have a contingent component which self-cures when we're not making money, and we think that's a superior design, because you're aligned incentives and when the business performs well, agents get paid well. And when it doesn't, we correct without having to change commission structures and contracts. So we built and deployed that and had that out in market. Now competitors who have pulled back, we know agents have long memories. And we think that will potentially hinder their ability to restore growth when they want to come back in the market later in '24 or beyond.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you for the answers.\nJohn Sauerland: Robinson segment. So just for clarity, we do have different commission structures for our Platinum agencies to incent the bundle. And we think we're very competitive with the marketplace when it comes to compensating our independent agents for bundled business as well as monoline business. Fair to say.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So just following up on one of your earlier answers, you mentioned the app comparison, comp comparisons being tough and that will suppress growth in the app count in 1Q. Should we assume a similar trend for PIF growth as well to where it will be weaker in 1Q and improve year after? Or does that not apply to PIF growth?\nTricia Griffith: I don't think you're going to expect as much of a different trend in PIF than New Apps. New Apps were up just so much. Like I said, 92% in direct, 83% overall. It was just a tremendous quarter and we actually tried to slow growth. So you're just going to see a little bit of a negative trend. But I think PIFs, of course, are not just new apps or also our retention. And our preferred year to growth is unit growth because as you've seen over these years where average written premium can go up and down, that's where you want the unit growth to be able to have that stable value company.\nJimmy Bhullar: And the reason I was asking is PIF growth was good in 1Q, but it wasn't sort of outsized. I think you grew 5% in January, 7% in February and 10% in March in personal auto. And then just following up\u2026\nTricia Griffith: It's pretty good on our book. Yes, I would, anything with -- that begins with one and another number, I'm pretty impressed with PIF growth with the book of our size.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just following up on sort of competitor behavior. What are, I realize that you guys are not raising prices as much as many of your peers, because you started repricing your book earlier. But in terms of marketing spend, are you seeing competitors pull back on marketing spend as well as [indiscernible] profitability? Or are they continuing to market pretty heavy?\nTricia Griffith: No, I think we're seeing competitors reenter the market, and that's why we believe it's a good time. We're still seeing, like I said, some ambient shopping, but I think it's going to be a really competitive year for everyone, and we're excited about it.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a little bit of a longer-term question here, but Progressive is a growth company and has certainly been taking share and it seems like you'll be the market leader in personal auto in short order, if you're not already. Is there an internal view on the structural ceiling that Progressive can hold over time? Like is something around the 19% share that State Farm held in the early 2000s aspirational for Progressive? Or do you think you can gain more share than that?\nTricia Griffith: I mean we want to grow as much as we possibly can while we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. So we're going to continue, we're not going to have a ceiling with that. What we will do is understand the addressable market. And kind of go across both, all of our lines of business to understand where we need to invest, where we need to, where we think we can gain more share. And that's really why we diversify. That's really why we've had the HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer, AutoQuote Explorer to be able to gather more market share, be transparent for our customers and give them an easy way to shop and save even if it's not with us. That's also one of the reasons why years ago, we set a construct together that we used this McKinsey construct that were called the Three Horizons. And the first one is execute. We've been working on that since 2016, 2017, and that is execute the heck out of growing or getting as much on private passenger auto and commercial auto and home business that we can as long as we're making money. And we've done extraordinarily well. They're obviously surpassing $61 billion in premiums for 2023. The second horizon is the exciting part in Commercial Lines where we've been growing our BMTs there, but we also have some expansion coverage that we're excited about. We just entered our 45th state with Florida last week. So very excited about that. We obviously bought Protective to have larger fleets. We're now calling Protective just so you know, Progressive fleet and specialty. And of course, our TNC business. So those ancillary products that where we believe we have the right to play and the right to win, and those have been really exciting expansion for Karen and her group. And then Horizon 3 is a little bit further afield, but those are some products that we believe will fit unmet customer needs and you think kind of longer-term out. So we're constantly in a cycle of three years, five years, 10 years. And in fact, we have our Board retreat later this week to outline how we intend to continue to grow market share across the board and do so in a profitable manner. So we're excited about the future. We're excited about the position we're in at this point given the extreme amount of uncertainty in the last four years. And if there's any team that can do it, it is the team here in Cleveland, Ohio.\nRobert Cox: Awesome. Thank you so much for that. And maybe just on the second question, I was just hoping you could walk us through some of the larger states that you're not yet rate adequate and what is the game plan for those states?\nTricia Griffith: Well, we're, it's typical, some of the typical states you've talked about on the coast, think of New Jersey, New York, California on the direct side. We just got a plus 20 on California agency. So that is a good move towards that. We're having continued conversations because this is really about the consumer. We want to have availability for each consumer to be able to get the coverage they need to protect the things that they love. And all we want to do is try to make $0.04 of underwriting profits. So we're going to continue to work with each insurance department to get the rate that we need and then be fully open and available for those consumers.\nRobert Cox: Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, going back to the marketing, and I guess maybe a little bit tying into the PIF discussion. As you guys lay out the marketing budget for this year, Tricia, are you expecting it to be even throughout the four quarters? Like how do you think about the cadence of the marketing spend as you think about trying to acquire customers during 2024?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. So some of the marketing spend, we already like pre-buy. So that's sort of out there. And then other that we have like digital and some other areas where we can be more fluid will react to what's happening in the environment. So if we feel like that our MP6 is down, which is our new prospects, we can increase it. We're always going to do it and try to be efficient around it. That's really the game plan. And again, it has to do with what our customers are doing -- I'm sorry, our competitors are doing. So it's not an easy question. We continually tweak it to make sure we're efficient while bringing as much new business in the door that we can and then we have some that will already be on the books. Do you want to add anything, Pat?\nPat Callahan: No, I would say we normally pace heavier in Q1 than we do in Q4 because of customer shopping. So just as Tricia said, we'll fish where the fish are. And when there's a lot of people out there in market, we want to advertise to make sure they know where available and to bring them to Progressive. As we've stated this year, we're opening up maybe a little slower than we did in 2023. So from a pacing perspective, we'll probably be more level between Q1, Q2 and Q3 than we historically would have been. But we also know that if the hard market prevails and continues, then we will want to continue to spend up to our allowables to capitalize on growth while people are looking for a new provider of auto home or commercial insurance.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I don't forget about our other lever, and that is opening up and unraveling our non-rate actions. So we've got a couple of different things in play, and that's the reason to believe, and our reason to believe that we can capture a lot of market share this year. So that's another avenue that we've continued to do since late last year.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up, you guys saw favorable development in January. For the first time in a while, right, typically, that's a month right when you have late reporting claims from the prior year, what drove that development in January? And does that, was that frequency or severity driven? I'm just wanting to get a sense that there would be some expectations for continuation of that better trend in '24?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I would say the January decrease. The majority of that was Florida. Most of the other states were pretty tight. Again, it's one month, and we will let that year play out. Gary's team looks at a lot of data each and every month just to make sure were adequately reserved, and I'll let his team do that. It's very separate from. And I'd like Gary do the right thing on behalf of the company, but I wouldn't read too much into January. It's obviously, we're pleased to have favorable development, but it was mostly Florida.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. So I had a question just on just -- Tricia, just how impactful you think unraveling some of the nonreactions can be on PIF growth. Just wondering relative to ad spend, historically, has there been more impact to PIF growth from bringing up or down marketing spend compared to non-rate actions? Or can you help size the potential for growth from rolling back those non-rate actions?\nTricia Griffith: It's really hard to size because I think I feel like we've never been tighter in our non-rate actions than we were last year. Again, it's hard to quantify because there's a bunch of different actions we'll do, and we'll do some on different products, different states. It could be different in channels. So it's hard to quantify. I think if you want to have a quicker reaction, the media spend does that. But it's hard to discern exactly what would go into each. What we do know is we were really tight trying to slow growth, making sure we got rate in the system and now we're able to unwind that. But we're not doing it full bore. We're doing it very logically to make sure that we reach our target profit margins.\nJohn Sauerland: And I'd add, if we're looking towards PIF growth, new business is one driver, but retention is a far stronger driver of PIF growth. And as Tricia mentioned, we are looking forward to more stable rates this year. We are feeling very adequate in most environments. So we have already enjoyed retention improvements, and we expect to continue to enjoy retention improvements. Competitors are certainly in a better place, but are continuing to raise rates as well. So on a competitiveness basis when the renewals come through, we think we're going to be in a good place, and that will help drive policy in force growth as well.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks for that. And that sort of leads into my follow-up is just last quarter, I think, Pat, you had said that PLEs and retentions were improving, but not at historical levels. Where are we at now? And just in -- just thinking about that because I recognize there is a tougher comp on new Apps, but I would think the retention comp is also a little bit different as well. So how far away are we from historical retention? Just sort of thinking through some of the drivers of PIF growth?\nTricia Griffith: I don't know historical at the top of my head, David, but we're pretty excited about both the trailing three and trailing 12 PLE and where we are from a month. And we sort of have internally, David here that we talk about the value of one month of PLE to our lifetime earned premium. I think we're pretty high.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. We are not yet quite back to our all-time high for policy life expectancy. But we're getting there. And our trajectory is certainly indicating that we might be achieving new highs later in the year. We can't project that, obviously. But when you look at the charts, that's what you might conclude. So again, will depend upon the competitive environment. We think we're in a much more stable place, meaning not having to take nearly as much rate as we have historically. The market continues to rise, and we think it's going to play well to policyholder retention.\nDavid Motemaden: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit about, Tricia, I guess, across the book, how you're thinking about severity in 2024?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, I like the fact that severity seemed to moderate a little bit. And so we're hoping that it's a little bit benign. When you look at, last year, we were affected by fixing cars, and that seems to be a little bit calmer. So I think auto parts inflation is nearing 0 and auto services is in the kind of mid-single-digits. So we're, that's how we're thinking about it. We'll obviously watch if something changed as they did last year. But I'm thinking, I think benign and kind of moderate is what I would say from a severity perspective. And I feel the same way with [indiscernible] right in the 8% to 10%.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I know last year, you kind of shared with us early in the year, I think it was a modest amount of rate that you expected to be taking over the year. You mentioned California, New Jersey, New York. Could you just give us maybe a placeholder for, I guess what you're thinking in the aggregate, if you're able to get those, the rate in those states kind of yes, in the aggregate, what we'll be looking at in terms of rate increases in '24?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I really can't share that because it's different with each state. We're in the midst of talking to the departments and showing our verification for needs for those rates. All I can say is that we'll get what we need to, to be at our target profit margins, or won't be able to be as open, which is like I said, unfortunate for consumers. For the rest of the country, we feel good at the rate we have gotten for the last several years. And so that's really what we're focusing on in addition to the conversations and negotiations with our departments.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just one more, if I could sneak it in. obviously, progress with the Robinson. Just curious what the geographic diversity of that book looks like versus your broader auto book. Is that still kind of heavily coastal or I guess it doesn't look like the broader agency book does?\nTricia Griffith: Are you thinking, are you, Ryan, are you talking more like the property side of the Robinsons?\nRyan Tunis: On the Auto. So yes, because of the property, it had been coastal, I'm wondering if it's starting to look more like the, how you've historically seen the agency book?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I think we're trying to make sure that, well, there's Robinsons everywhere. So there could be a different value of the insurability of homes, et cetera. But yes, I think that, obviously, because Robinsons have a property feature to them, and we are getting into more nonvolatile states growth. You'll see Robinsons growth in those states over time. But it will take some time. I mean we were still in the midst of moving our book a little bit away from Florida, as we discussed with our 115,000 non-renewals that actually we set notices out in January, and those will start to non-renew into another company that we're working with to take those should they want them in May, of this year. But yes, we're if you read all the data of our PIF growth, our premium growth and our new app growth in nonvolatile versus volatile, we are ahead of plan, but still a long way to go. But we should grow Robinsons in those areas for sure.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Elyse's question, the Florida releases. Was that some of the litigation-related reserves from last year? And I guess, how are you feeling about those reserves in that kind of situation?\nTricia Griffith: It was mostly floor to kind of across the board, a couple of different things. Some were some settlements on glass, some from House Bill. So there was a couple of different inputs to the release, we are feeling positive about the tort reform change in Florida. And we're starting to see a little bit of that. I don't want to get ahead of my skis with that. But we believe, especially the new comp negligence law should be very helpful. But again, we'll watch that really closely because it's still new, and there's a lot of things that can unfold, but we're positive about the changes that have been made in Florida.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thanks. And then on frequency, curious about frequency kind of like year-to-date? Just following the very favorable December.\nTricia Griffith: I don't, if I were looking at frequency, I would look at it more on the trailing 12 over current 12 and about 2% because there's a lot that goes into the data that you saw from this quarter in terms of mix. So John talked about that a little bit. We were really tight with our underwriting. So our mix of business is more preferred which causes less frequency of accidents. You'll hear this a lot. But since we're changing to a Gregorian calendar, there is a little bit of data in there. And then, of course, weather in December was really benign. So I would think that, and of course, we can't predict frequency or severity. But I would be thinking of frequency as more of reverting back to our normal trend ex-all COVID, et cetera, the last 60 years, frequencies continue to decline a couple of points every year.\nMichael Ward: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you so much. Two quick questions. First, Tricia, in the past, you talked about how the last sort of piece of the property puzzle was getting non-cat weather price correctly. Do you think that was the issue that kept you above the 96% in 2023?\nTricia Griffith: Well, there's a lot of things that went to that. I'm trying to think of, I was just thinking of January, too, because some of the weather in January was actually nonvolatile. So there's weather just across the board here and there, nothing big with cats. But I would say a lot of things went into 2023. We didn't have the right rate. We're still working on our segmentation. We really in earnest just started to be able to de-risk especially in the really volatile states. And I think all those things together kind of put us where we were at the end of the year.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. The second question is with regards to PAA. Is there any limitation on your like contractual limitations on your ability to use the data from other companies?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We are very, we are, it's a very important thing for the relationships to make sure that their proprietary data is just that, and we don't share it within other places of Progressive. So as an example, there's a company we've worked with for a long time. They're a great partner, and we actually bifurcate the monthly reports, the data because we think that is really important for everyone to have their algorithms and same with ours.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\nTricia Griffith: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question ties back to Josh's questions on economies of scale and the improving expense ratio. How much room does that leave you guys to maybe increase your ad spend, marketing spend without really compromising on efficiencies and seeing significantly lower incremental returns there?\nTricia Griffith: Well, if you're talking about expense ratio, I would look, I probably look more directly at our direct expense ratio because that's we're going to hit some of the marketing spend. And it's pretty low, especially compared, maybe this isn't the right comparison. Especially compared to January of last year, it was like 4.5 points lower. So there will be pressure on the expense ratio. Even though the marketing spend will be efficient just because it's out there. And you'll see that I would follow the direct spend. If you look at December's direct loss ratio to January. I think December was a little bit over 12%. So you're going to start to see that when we put our media budget into play.\nYaron Kinar: Right. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is if we go back, we'll see an expense ratio of roughly 20%, which is a mix of ad spend and other stuff. Can you essentially fill the ad spend bucket to get back to 20%? Or is the economies of scale so significant today that, that 20% rate is probably kind of not so relevant anymore?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I mean, I'll let Pat add in. I think to John talked a little bit about the non-acquisition expense rate. So I'll show acquisition. I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit. We are not going to spend just to spend to get up to the 20%. We're going to be efficient. Now for some reason, it gets up to 20%, and we are bringing great new business and huge amounts, and we feel great about. That could be one thing. And then we'll continue to focus on the pressuring non-acquisition expense ratio as one part of that formula. Do you want to add anything?\nPat Callahan: Yes. I think that's your characterization is spot on in that we have a hierarchy of levers that we pull in order to slow the business and in order to grow the business on the other side. So whether it's starting with reducing verification or opening up more favorable bill plans, then spending more than if we're doing all those and unable to drive conversion at a level that we want to grow, we would potentially lower rates at that point. But that's the hierarchy that we're reversing right now. And at this point, what's maybe a little deceiving is average premiums have gone up significantly due to the rate increases, which is driving down that expense ratio. So even if we got spending back to an absolute dollar basis, where we were in the past, you're not going to get your expense ratio back to where it was in the past. But to Tricia's point, our budget is governed by our ability to efficiently acquire customers against what we expect to be the lifetime value of that customer to Progressive and of course, to make sure we can deliver phenomenal claims and customer service and support the growth on that end. So I hope that helps in that we're not swinging back to 20%. What we're doing is unwinding some of the changes that we've made. Some have very little expense costs associated with them. Media, obviously has a greater cost to it on the other side.\nJohn Sauerland: Sorry. I just wanted to give a little greater appreciation of how we spend. We do it in an extremely surgical and analytical manner. We have loads in our pricing by customer segment at a very finite level. And so we understand what we can spend to and meet our lifetime combined ratio targets on each customer segment. So as we go into spend, we are not targeting an expense ratio to Pat's point, we are being extremely surgical and targeted in going after customer segments where we know we can spend up to that allowable cost that we have priced into the product at the segment level. A little different approach than I think you're thinking.\nYaron Kinar: I think you just articulated than the way I was able to ask the questions. So thank you, my other question, if we could switch to the commercial book. I think you had some volatility in the TNC business last year, both in terms of the top line growth and more importantly, there's the loss ratio. Can you maybe give us an update where you are today, how comfortable you are with it? But kind of the trajectory you see there?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So for the, let me kind of talk about Commercial overall, and I'll get into the TNC part. So -- for our core commercial business, I feel much more positive where we are from a combined ratio perspective, especially with 16 points yet to earn in this year. And then I talked a little bit about some expansion products that we talked about like in Horizon 2. So think of Progressive Fleet, think of TNC, think of our BOP. Those do put a little pressure on our core business, but we think it's important to invest in them. The TNC, we've continued to strengthen reserves, as you saw last year, and we'll have some rate increases that go into play significant ones this quarter. So we feel much better about it. And if you go back we have 20 states total between the two companies that we work with. But if you go back to where, we started with our first state in 2016. That knowledge that we've learned in the TNC business has really helped us. So each state is a little bit different depending on the maturity level of that. And a lot of what happened last year with the reserve strengthening, happened to be in two states, New Jersey and California and in coverages of UM and UIM. So that's where we're working to get the right rate to make sure we can reach our profit margin.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks for putting me in. I think I just have, well, maybe two. Just one. To what extent is the hard market in Personal Auto have any impact on the mix of customers that stay bundled. In other words, if there's more, maybe sticker shock in one versus the other? Are you seeing customers kind of get away from the desire to bundle?\nTricia Griffith: I mean I think right now, customers are looking for price because it's gone up so much with everything else. So people do you like to bundle because you can also get a discount in most companies. The hard market for me I really equate to more just overall shopping. Just people get their renewals and they shop and can have we already got the rate in the system to get them. So we want to get auto, we want to get home and we want to get the bundled regardless of either one. Obviously, we care a lot about the bundle. But it's really, I think customers dictate the market based on the trends they're seeing in their bills.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. And then just separate, can you share any thoughts on loss trends in your Protective business that you did a couple of years ago? How is that looking? And any trends there?\nTricia Griffith: Not really. No.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Nothing that stands out versus normal the smaller fleets, the smaller normal commercial business?\nTricia Griffith: No. We continue, we'll continue to grow. We've expanded our own fleet before Protective from 10 power units to 40 power units. We continue to expand. We continue to work on the integration of the acquisition, we feel positive about the acquisition. And we have some rate in the system definitely for a Progressive Fleet, but nothing really more than that to share.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you so much for taking the follow-up. I was just wondering whether the PAA commissions factor into either the 96% combined ratio target somehow? Or if there is a profit goal for that business?\nTricia Griffith: The commissions are just that. There's just commissions that come in the door that we've agreed with the companies and then there, of course, rating their auto or their home based on their rating algorithm.\nJohn Sauerland: They flow as a contract expense on the area in that combined ratio.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I'm sorry.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. Are you guys considering making any changes to your reinsurance program as it comes up for renewal this year?\nTricia Griffith: I think well, you saw what was outlined in the K with the Aggregate Program. And then our CAT Tower Program is up for renewal in June, and we're working on that. Right now, actually, two of the people are in London, talking with our reinsurers, we feel like we'll have some positive results come the June renewal.\nJohn Sauerland: Yes. So we don't have anything definitive to offer Elyse, but you can generally think of us targeting retention in generally the same area. I can't guarantee it will be exactly the same. We have, as we de-risked the property portfolio been enjoying decreasing PMLs. So that helps us at the top of the tower because we might not have to buy as much. But generally speaking, you can think of the focus and the structure of the CAT Program at June 1 is very similar to what we have today.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Great. Just a quick follow-up. First, I heard you say, I think it was the first time you've said that you feel the recent Florida legislative reforms are actually a positive. You gave some context around it. But just curious, are the reforms meaningful enough that it might cause you to change your de-risking strategy in the state of Florida, which has been I think more home insurance centric?\nTricia Griffith: No. I think what allows me to think about is being able to continue to grow there and not have so much litigation that puts pressure on the rest of the book. We still had, when we think about the de-risking of the Florida property book. Half of those were rental properties, coastal properties. Those are things that I feel like we should have de-risked anyway regardless. So I think you would do that anyway, and I wouldn't go back from that. I mean I think the reforms will be good overall just for the structure. And of course, again, I don't want to get out ahead of my skis, I want to kind of see how it pans out. But yes, I think that's what I would say. So we're seeing some small data signs that we believe it's good. Again, I want to give it some time. I want to de-risk the book. And right now, we're open for business really in sported with new construction on homes, and that's it.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just had a question on the 19 points of personal auto rate that you guys got last year. How much of that is still yet to earn in?\nTricia Griffith: How much of that Pat, I think...\nPat Callahan: At this point, I think we've probably got, I don't know, eight to nine points that are still earning in I'd have to look at the table for details, but we got some big rate increases later in the year that we'll still earn in because we've got obviously six months and then 12-month policy renewals.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Understood. And then just on the ambient shopping levels, have you guys seen any changes in ambient shopping over the last several months?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. We've seen the increase in ambient shopping. And so we'll watch and see if that continues. And I think when some of our competitors get their rate in the system, like Pat just said, it depends on the competitor because some have six-month policies, many have 12-month policies, which obviously takes a lot more time to earn in. I'm sure we'll see that diminish, but that's when we have all the other levers that we have for our growth.\nDavid Motemaden: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question.\nTricia Griffith: Let's wrap up after this.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Last but not least. Thanks. I was just wondering the claims specialist in property, is that the increase in that number? Is that part of the customer value prop? Or is it something else?\nTricia Griffith: I'm not clear on your question.\nMichael Ward: The property claims specialist count increased? On the 10-K we noticed.\nPat Callahan: Is that property claims. Is that.\nTricia Griffith: The growth for the head count growth?\nMichael Ward: Yes.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. So we are growing our ability to handle our own claims internally historically, especially when we first bought ASI, the majority of the claims that we handled were through independent adjusters. And while we still use a lot of independent adjusters for our appraisals, we wanted to have that talent in-house. So that is the increase. Sorry, I did understand your question to begin with. But yes, that increase is just to us to have that talent and understanding as we grow our property book.\nMichael Ward: Awesome. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Doug.\nDouglas Constantine: That appears to be our final question. So that concludes our event. And Towando [ph], I'll hand it back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Progressive Corporation's fourth quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Sean Freeman",
            "content": "Thank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it. I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this Destination Era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win-win-win strategy. As we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first. The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime. But beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice. Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies in addition to our own underwritten policies ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of the shopping experiences, with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts. Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own. Progressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business. So we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules in addition to our strong adherence to any provided procedures as of their appointed agencies. Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers. Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this Destination Era Strategy allows us to achieve greater top line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention and serves as a stable source of revenues complementary to our underwriting profits. As we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive. In doing so, we have seen a steady trend up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in Personal Lines, we can offer renters and/or home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy or in Commercial Lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs and in turn help us grow. Another important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately, how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers. Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation, and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences. Along with the previous slide, these top of funnel benefits are foundational to the win-win-win dynamic that I started with. As these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes. As highlighted in the last two slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers. The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least one rate for our consumer. This is not surprising, but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products such as homeowners. As a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return. While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive. Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime. We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive. Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship nine months longer on average as a result of this multi-carrier safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected retention of the original policy also dramatically improves. Across all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to 2x or more. It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a multicarrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers. Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive's offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com, our call centers as well as our appointed independent agents. This, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further. This starts the cycle all over again. As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cap risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly. This includes prominent risks such as weather and natural disasters. As agency compensation is really directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risk that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted, stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement. Our top line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive's underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation. Additionally, our success is penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments. The service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network. As the chart on the lower right demonstrates this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While it has not lost and made this as an Investor Relations call, and thus, the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs. Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progress through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or Life Insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely. Happily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe, make good on our win-win-win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency."

            "name": "Lori Niederst",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Doug said, my name is Lori Niederst and I'm excited to be the first to participate in our new format. Traditionally, Tricia provides the opening comments for these presentations. But going forward, members of our leadership team will have the opportunity to speak to topics in our area of responsibility and introduce the talented individuals executing on these initiatives that we highlight during the event. In previous presentations, we've discussed our strategic pillars, which serve as the foundation of our vision. Today, we're focusing on one of those pillars, serving the broad needs of our customers. This pillar is synonymous with our strategy to become a destination company, providing products that meet our customers' changing needs throughout their lifetime. We seek to instill customer confidence in both the products and the prices that we offer. To set the stage for today's presentation, I thought it would be helpful to recap the history of Progressive's evolution as a destination company. Back in 2008, we publicly introduced our now ubiquitous customer segments, Sams, Dianes, Wrights, and Robinsons. In 2014, we first spoke of our destination strategy, stating our intention to invest in the products, services and experiences to better serve customers from all four segments. Since then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes, and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive, but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium. Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success. Even before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel, led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance. ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles as well as partner bundles to significantly increase our appeal to the rights in Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market, where we continue to be an industry leader. In 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers, and bundle with our Commercial Auto and BOP coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in Personal Auto with AutoQuote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com. This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with Home and Personal Auto, our Commercial Auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes Progressive underwritten Special Lines, Renters and Umbrella products. By expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business. The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one Progressive sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far reaching. The top line growth from increased sales of progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning. The more products the customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per policy acquisition costs. Fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share. But it's not just Progressive the benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners. Making this destination strategy, a win, win, win. It's important to note that today, we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts Progressive has undertaken we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn, and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers. While we're focusing on Direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce Kathryn Lemieux, a 42-year Progressive veteran and our Business Leader for CRM Sales Experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence. Our second speaker is Sean Freeman. Sean is a Business Leader of our Comparison Rating Experience and Direct Property Quoting, who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multi-product households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy."

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mike. Here's how we're thinking about growth right now, which is somewhat different and somewhat alike last year. So we went into 2023 feeling like we had the right rate in the system. Clearly, as the year unfolded, and we realized that inflations were still going up, so they hadn't abated, and we needed more rate. So our sole concentration last year was to get the right rate on the street. And we feel like we're in a really great position right now. So if you think about the overarching belief that we have the right rates in the system, and we believe we do now understand there's all the caveats about we don't have every state. We're still working with some states to get rate. But for the most part, we feel really good about our rate. This is how we're thinking about growth, really sort of the trifecta. So we have a continued hard market. Ambient shopping is still up. So we know our competitors are still getting rate. So those customers are shopping and we're able to get that at a really inexpensive acquisition cost. Then we also know that we're unraveling a lot of our non-rate actions, our underwriting actions. We talked about that a little bit in November, but we're going to continue to do that. And then really the third part of that trifecta is our ability to be able to spend a lot on media. So we are really excited about heading into 2024. Obviously, my whole theme for the annual report was uncertainty. So, or the letter I should say, is uncertainty. We feel much more certain and much more confident we will watch as the data unfolds, and we're pretty excited. The one caveat I would say, Mike, is when we're starting to look at first quarter of this year, versus first quarter of last year, you're going to see some really odd comparisons on new App growth. So we are growing new Apps like crazy last year. In fact, on the Direct Side, our new apps were up 93%. Overall, in Auto up, I think, like 83% or 82%. So huge comparisons if you're going to compare it to this quarter. So keep that in mind as this quarter closes, we believe it will smooth out over the year, but that's something we should just make a note of. Yes. I mean I think our continuous product model is our secret sauce. Over the years, I think we've sort of shared not in a lot of detail, but how, each model sort of adds segmentation and gets us to where we want, especially with the preferred customer. UBI is a big part of it and has been for a long time, and that will continue to be and why we're investing more and more into our latest product model, which is our continuous. I think with the Florida added this year, we're at about 70% continuous, and we're learning a lot from that. And we'll be able to do a lot for our customers as well. So maybe at some time when we do some of the deep dives, we can share a little bit more about how we think about our [indiscernible]. We're never going to share a secret sauce because that is just that. But we literally have our R&D departments working in both Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Property, nonstop, thinking about the next mode to just get that extra piece of data to understand how it correlates to loss costs. Thank you. Yes, I would say back to more historical levels. We've had a couple, several rough years where we've had to pull back on media I mentioned that in my letter. They've been incredible. We have a media machine, a marketing machine and both are working really well, and we want to leverage that. We're not going to spend if we don't think it's efficient. When I talked about our growth in sort of the trifecta, we're getting a lot of ambient shopping still, and we'll continue to watch that. However, we think there's an opportunity to kind of open up the spigot and get more business in the door. We feel like we're in a really prime time now, especially with our rates. So while we're not going to share our full budget we believe we can spend assuming all things with our pricing is right and we get pricing and some rate in some of the states that we need, I think we'll be able to spend a tremendous amount to really leverage what we think could be a great growth year. Yes. I think that has to do a lot with timing. So a lot of our competitors have increased rates as well pretty substantially. So there's a sort of a time frame. I don't know exactly when that is. But right now, we believe, we are able to take market share. Again, there'll be some, at some point, there'll be stable rates throughout the industry and there'll be less shopping. Really, the key for us in terms of market share will be to grab as much new business at or below our target market -- target profit. And really, the holy grail is retention and keeping those customers. So the key this year for us because we've had so many years of rate after rate is to have some stability for our customers. They deserve that. We want that. Of course, we'll watch the trends, and we'll have to react to those trends. But I'd like some stable rates because I think if we've got the new business coming in the door and then people staying with us, that is a huge win. And then, of course, Robinsons, we've continued to grow. We're excited about continuing to invest in our HomeQuote Explorer and the Progressive Advantage Agency. Working with great partners in that. Absolutely. Thanks, Bob. Well, I think any time you have an economies of scale, you'll be able to push down the expense ratio. We're always trying to balance out our expenses with investments and what the customers want. So digital and other things like that. So the bigger you get, I think the more you can, whether it's brand or expenses you can push on that, but we have been investing a lot in digital for our customers, and we'll continue to do that. One of our other pillars, and we talked about broad coverage today is competitive prices. And the two parts of competitive prices are really what we talked about a little bit earlier with Mike's question, that's segmentation having industry-leading segmentation. Understanding rate to risk. And the other is expenses. And we are constantly challenging ourselves to what's that right balance of investing, but getting those economies of scale. We'll continue to work on that for as long as I'm here for sure. And as long as John Sauerland is for sure. I can let Pat take that. I mean we, our commissions have been pretty stable and we have different structures depending on if we have a Platinum agent and some other programs we have with different agents I think, I don't want to speak too specifically to our competitors because they also ebb and flow. I don't think you're going to expect as much of a different trend in PIF than New Apps. New Apps were up just so much. Like I said, 92% in direct, 83% overall. It was just a tremendous quarter and we actually tried to slow growth. So you're just going to see a little bit of a negative trend. But I think PIFs, of course, are not just new apps or also our retention. And our preferred year to growth is unit growth because as you've seen over these years where average written premium can go up and down, that's where you want the unit growth to be able to have that stable value company. It's pretty good on our book. Yes, I would, anything with -- that begins with one and another number, I'm pretty impressed with PIF growth with the book of our size. No, I think we're seeing competitors reenter the market, and that's why we believe it's a good time. We're still seeing, like I said, some ambient shopping, but I think it's going to be a really competitive year for everyone, and we're excited about it. Thank you. I mean we want to grow as much as we possibly can while we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. So we're going to continue, we're not going to have a ceiling with that. What we will do is understand the addressable market. And kind of go across both, all of our lines of business to understand where we need to invest, where we need to, where we think we can gain more share. And that's really why we diversify. That's really why we've had the HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer, AutoQuote Explorer to be able to gather more market share, be transparent for our customers and give them an easy way to shop and save even if it's not with us. That's also one of the reasons why years ago, we set a construct together that we used this McKinsey construct that were called the Three Horizons. And the first one is execute. We've been working on that since 2016, 2017, and that is execute the heck out of growing or getting as much on private passenger auto and commercial auto and home business that we can as long as we're making money. And we've done extraordinarily well. They're obviously surpassing $61 billion in premiums for 2023. The second horizon is the exciting part in Commercial Lines where we've been growing our BMTs there, but we also have some expansion coverage that we're excited about. We just entered our 45th state with Florida last week. So very excited about that. We obviously bought Protective to have larger fleets. We're now calling Protective just so you know, Progressive fleet and specialty. And of course, our TNC business. So those ancillary products that where we believe we have the right to play and the right to win, and those have been really exciting expansion for Karen and her group. And then Horizon 3 is a little bit further afield, but those are some products that we believe will fit unmet customer needs and you think kind of longer-term out. So we're constantly in a cycle of three years, five years, 10 years. And in fact, we have our Board retreat later this week to outline how we intend to continue to grow market share across the board and do so in a profitable manner. So we're excited about the future. We're excited about the position we're in at this point given the extreme amount of uncertainty in the last four years. And if there's any team that can do it, it is the team here in Cleveland, Ohio. Well, we're, it's typical, some of the typical states you've talked about on the coast, think of New Jersey, New York, California on the direct side. We just got a plus 20 on California agency. So that is a good move towards that. We're having continued conversations because this is really about the consumer. We want to have availability for each consumer to be able to get the coverage they need to protect the things that they love. And all we want to do is try to make $0.04 of underwriting profits. So we're going to continue to work with each insurance department to get the rate that we need and then be fully open and available for those consumers. Thank you. Thanks, Elyse. So some of the marketing spend, we already like pre-buy. So that's sort of out there. And then other that we have like digital and some other areas where we can be more fluid will react to what's happening in the environment. So if we feel like that our MP6 is down, which is our new prospects, we can increase it. We're always going to do it and try to be efficient around it. That's really the game plan. And again, it has to do with what our customers are doing -- I'm sorry, our competitors are doing. So it's not an easy question. We continually tweak it to make sure we're efficient while bringing as much new business in the door that we can and then we have some that will already be on the books. Do you want to add anything, Pat? Yes, I don't forget about our other lever, and that is opening up and unraveling our non-rate actions. So we've got a couple of different things in play, and that's the reason to believe, and our reason to believe that we can capture a lot of market share this year. So that's another avenue that we've continued to do since late last year. Yes. I would say the January decrease. The majority of that was Florida. Most of the other states were pretty tight. Again, it's one month, and we will let that year play out. Gary's team looks at a lot of data each and every month just to make sure were adequately reserved, and I'll let his team do that. It's very separate from. And I'd like Gary do the right thing on behalf of the company, but I wouldn't read too much into January. It's obviously, we're pleased to have favorable development, but it was mostly Florida. It's really hard to size because I think I feel like we've never been tighter in our non-rate actions than we were last year. Again, it's hard to quantify because there's a bunch of different actions we'll do, and we'll do some on different products, different states. It could be different in channels. So it's hard to quantify. I think if you want to have a quicker reaction, the media spend does that. But it's hard to discern exactly what would go into each. What we do know is we were really tight trying to slow growth, making sure we got rate in the system and now we're able to unwind that. But we're not doing it full bore. We're doing it very logically to make sure that we reach our target profit margins. I don't know historical at the top of my head, David, but we're pretty excited about both the trailing three and trailing 12 PLE and where we are from a month. And we sort of have internally, David here that we talk about the value of one month of PLE to our lifetime earned premium. I think we're pretty high. Yes. I mean, I like the fact that severity seemed to moderate a little bit. And so we're hoping that it's a little bit benign. When you look at, last year, we were affected by fixing cars, and that seems to be a little bit calmer. So I think auto parts inflation is nearing 0 and auto services is in the kind of mid-single-digits. So we're, that's how we're thinking about it. We'll obviously watch if something changed as they did last year. But I'm thinking, I think benign and kind of moderate is what I would say from a severity perspective. And I feel the same way with [indiscernible] right in the 8% to 10%. Yes. I really can't share that because it's different with each state. We're in the midst of talking to the departments and showing our verification for needs for those rates. All I can say is that we'll get what we need to, to be at our target profit margins, or won't be able to be as open, which is like I said, unfortunate for consumers. For the rest of the country, we feel good at the rate we have gotten for the last several years. And so that's really what we're focusing on in addition to the conversations and negotiations with our departments. Are you thinking, are you, Ryan, are you talking more like the property side of the Robinsons? Yes. I think we're trying to make sure that, well, there's Robinsons everywhere. So there could be a different value of the insurability of homes, et cetera. But yes, I think that, obviously, because Robinsons have a property feature to them, and we are getting into more nonvolatile states growth. You'll see Robinsons growth in those states over time. But it will take some time. I mean we were still in the midst of moving our book a little bit away from Florida, as we discussed with our 115,000 non-renewals that actually we set notices out in January, and those will start to non-renew into another company that we're working with to take those should they want them in May, of this year. But yes, we're if you read all the data of our PIF growth, our premium growth and our new app growth in nonvolatile versus volatile, we are ahead of plan, but still a long way to go. But we should grow Robinsons in those areas for sure. It was mostly floor to kind of across the board, a couple of different things. Some were some settlements on glass, some from House Bill. So there was a couple of different inputs to the release, we are feeling positive about the tort reform change in Florida. And we're starting to see a little bit of that. I don't want to get ahead of my skis with that. But we believe, especially the new comp negligence law should be very helpful. But again, we'll watch that really closely because it's still new, and there's a lot of things that can unfold, but we're positive about the changes that have been made in Florida. I don't, if I were looking at frequency, I would look at it more on the trailing 12 over current 12 and about 2% because there's a lot that goes into the data that you saw from this quarter in terms of mix. So John talked about that a little bit. We were really tight with our underwriting. So our mix of business is more preferred which causes less frequency of accidents. You'll hear this a lot. But since we're changing to a Gregorian calendar, there is a little bit of data in there. And then, of course, weather in December was really benign. So I would think that, and of course, we can't predict frequency or severity. But I would be thinking of frequency as more of reverting back to our normal trend ex-all COVID, et cetera, the last 60 years, frequencies continue to decline a couple of points every year. Well, there's a lot of things that went to that. I'm trying to think of, I was just thinking of January, too, because some of the weather in January was actually nonvolatile. So there's weather just across the board here and there, nothing big with cats. But I would say a lot of things went into 2023. We didn't have the right rate. We're still working on our segmentation. We really in earnest just started to be able to de-risk especially in the really volatile states. And I think all those things together kind of put us where we were at the end of the year. Yes. We are very, we are, it's a very important thing for the relationships to make sure that their proprietary data is just that, and we don't share it within other places of Progressive. So as an example, there's a company we've worked with for a long time. They're a great partner, and we actually bifurcate the monthly reports, the data because we think that is really important for everyone to have their algorithms and same with ours. Welcome. Well, if you're talking about expense ratio, I would look, I probably look more directly at our direct expense ratio because that's we're going to hit some of the marketing spend. And it's pretty low, especially compared, maybe this isn't the right comparison. Especially compared to January of last year, it was like 4.5 points lower. So there will be pressure on the expense ratio. Even though the marketing spend will be efficient just because it's out there. And you'll see that I would follow the direct spend. If you look at December's direct loss ratio to January. I think December was a little bit over 12%. So you're going to start to see that when we put our media budget into play. Yes. I mean, I'll let Pat add in. I think to John talked a little bit about the non-acquisition expense rate. So I'll show acquisition. I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit. We are not going to spend just to spend to get up to the 20%. We're going to be efficient. Now for some reason, it gets up to 20%, and we are bringing great new business and huge amounts, and we feel great about. That could be one thing. And then we'll continue to focus on the pressuring non-acquisition expense ratio as one part of that formula. Do you want to add anything? Yes. So for the, let me kind of talk about Commercial overall, and I'll get into the TNC part. So -- for our core commercial business, I feel much more positive where we are from a combined ratio perspective, especially with 16 points yet to earn in this year. And then I talked a little bit about some expansion products that we talked about like in Horizon 2. So think of Progressive Fleet, think of TNC, think of our BOP. Those do put a little pressure on our core business, but we think it's important to invest in them. The TNC, we've continued to strengthen reserves, as you saw last year, and we'll have some rate increases that go into play significant ones this quarter. So we feel much better about it. And if you go back we have 20 states total between the two companies that we work with. But if you go back to where, we started with our first state in 2016. That knowledge that we've learned in the TNC business has really helped us. So each state is a little bit different depending on the maturity level of that. And a lot of what happened last year with the reserve strengthening, happened to be in two states, New Jersey and California and in coverages of UM and UIM. So that's where we're working to get the right rate to make sure we can reach our profit margin. I mean I think right now, customers are looking for price because it's gone up so much with everything else. So people do you like to bundle because you can also get a discount in most companies. The hard market for me I really equate to more just overall shopping. Just people get their renewals and they shop and can have we already got the rate in the system to get them. So we want to get auto, we want to get home and we want to get the bundled regardless of either one. Obviously, we care a lot about the bundle. But it's really, I think customers dictate the market based on the trends they're seeing in their bills. Not really. No. No. We continue, we'll continue to grow. We've expanded our own fleet before Protective from 10 power units to 40 power units. We continue to expand. We continue to work on the integration of the acquisition, we feel positive about the acquisition. And we have some rate in the system definitely for a Progressive Fleet, but nothing really more than that to share. The commissions are just that. There's just commissions that come in the door that we've agreed with the companies and then there, of course, rating their auto or their home based on their rating algorithm. Yes, I'm sorry. I think well, you saw what was outlined in the K with the Aggregate Program. And then our CAT Tower Program is up for renewal in June, and we're working on that. Right now, actually, two of the people are in London, talking with our reinsurers, we feel like we'll have some positive results come the June renewal. No. I think what allows me to think about is being able to continue to grow there and not have so much litigation that puts pressure on the rest of the book. We still had, when we think about the de-risking of the Florida property book. Half of those were rental properties, coastal properties. Those are things that I feel like we should have de-risked anyway regardless. So I think you would do that anyway, and I wouldn't go back from that. I mean I think the reforms will be good overall just for the structure. And of course, again, I don't want to get out ahead of my skis, I want to kind of see how it pans out. But yes, I think that's what I would say. So we're seeing some small data signs that we believe it's good. Again, I want to give it some time. I want to de-risk the book. And right now, we're open for business really in sported with new construction on homes, and that's it. How much of that Pat, I think... Yes. We've seen the increase in ambient shopping. And so we'll watch and see if that continues. And I think when some of our competitors get their rate in the system, like Pat just said, it depends on the competitor because some have six-month policies, many have 12-month policies, which obviously takes a lot more time to earn in. I'm sure we'll see that diminish, but that's when we have all the other levers that we have for our growth. Thanks. Let's wrap up after this. I'm not clear on your question. The growth for the head count growth? Yes. So we are growing our ability to handle our own claims internally historically, especially when we first bought ASI, the majority of the claims that we handled were through independent adjusters. And while we still use a lot of independent adjusters for our appraisals, we wanted to have that talent in-house. So that is the increase. Sorry, I did understand your question to begin with. But yes, that increase is just to us to have that talent and understanding as we grow our property book. Thank you."

            "content": "Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere. Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle, which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley, and together, they acquired Renters Insurance until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance. Both our Renters and Homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as live events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage. We would have loved to sell a Progressive manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them. So we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach. Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand building on our industry-leading digital tools and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier. This recipe is proving very successful delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade. Over the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from Property to Commercial Lines from one carrier to many from the phone to the online channel and from Quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online, using our HomeQuote Explorer or BusinessQuote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop by phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote and buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers. We introduced a Digital Multi-carrier Quote experience, which we call HomeQuote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduce new features to improve the quoter experience and the platform's efficiency. These efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a QuickQuote Experience, which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit. Leveraging our proprietary models, we customize prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20%, reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers. However, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our HomeQuote Explorer portfolio and nine for BusinessQuote Explorer. There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA, which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier. To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care. They must offer a quality product at a fair price, pass our information security assessments and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most. Additionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless integrated digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey for significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation or if they eventually need to ensure their teenage driver. Our agencies ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events. Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive Auto Insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than 1 million Robinsons we ensure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time. But even when the event isn't life changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we are presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options, which gives us the chance to retain the customer. Often, we are able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges such as the e-mail presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest running product comparison experience, Auto Insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California. Insurance products were much simpler in those days, so at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse engineered them from public filings. This industry altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates. Our early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency. If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you who's is? And challenging the status quo now what you'd expect from an insurance company as early brand differentiators. As Progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit, underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions. The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party. This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past five years, we've conducted dozens of tests leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase Progressive's conversion and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey AutoQuote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022. We launched a Quote and Buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations. We're ready to introduce the AQX Experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison quote and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere. Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates, but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance, while giving customers confidence in the products, prices, and providers that we offer. But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase and we continue to refine the benefit statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean?"

            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "Yes. We've definitely seen competitors use commission cuts as a profitability or margin restoration lever. And we haven't done that. So we've maintained our commission. We do have a contingent component which self-cures when we're not making money, and we think that's a superior design, because you're aligned incentives and when the business performs well, agents get paid well. And when it doesn't, we correct without having to change commission structures and contracts. So we built and deployed that and had that out in market. Now competitors who have pulled back, we know agents have long memories. And we think that will potentially hinder their ability to restore growth when they want to come back in the market later in '24 or beyond. No, I would say we normally pace heavier in Q1 than we do in Q4 because of customer shopping. So just as Tricia said, we'll fish where the fish are. And when there's a lot of people out there in market, we want to advertise to make sure they know where available and to bring them to Progressive. As we've stated this year, we're opening up maybe a little slower than we did in 2023. So from a pacing perspective, we'll probably be more level between Q1, Q2 and Q3 than we historically would have been. But we also know that if the hard market prevails and continues, then we will want to continue to spend up to our allowables to capitalize on growth while people are looking for a new provider of auto home or commercial insurance. Yes. I think that's your characterization is spot on in that we have a hierarchy of levers that we pull in order to slow the business and in order to grow the business on the other side. So whether it's starting with reducing verification or opening up more favorable bill plans, then spending more than if we're doing all those and unable to drive conversion at a level that we want to grow, we would potentially lower rates at that point. But that's the hierarchy that we're reversing right now. And at this point, what's maybe a little deceiving is average premiums have gone up significantly due to the rate increases, which is driving down that expense ratio. So even if we got spending back to an absolute dollar basis, where we were in the past, you're not going to get your expense ratio back to where it was in the past. But to Tricia's point, our budget is governed by our ability to efficiently acquire customers against what we expect to be the lifetime value of that customer to Progressive and of course, to make sure we can deliver phenomenal claims and customer service and support the growth on that end. So I hope that helps in that we're not swinging back to 20%. What we're doing is unwinding some of the changes that we've made. Some have very little expense costs associated with them. Media, obviously has a greater cost to it on the other side. At this point, I think we've probably got, I don't know, eight to nine points that are still earning in I'd have to look at the table for details, but we got some big rate increases later in the year that we'll still earn in because we've got obviously six months and then 12-month policy renewals. Is that property claims. Is that."

            "content": "I can also add that you're right. When you look over even decades, you see our frequency being more favorable than the industry and severity being somewhat similar to the industry. And Tricia noted what we believe are some of the key drivers, but we are also continuing to shift the mix of our business to more preferred customers who generally have lower claims frequency. So, it's hard to parse out exactly which piece of those frequency trends are the aforementioned, but we should note that we're also moving more and more to preferred and that will drive the frequency down as well. Josh, sorry. As I think you know, we focus internally on what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio. So we talked a lot about media. We're always looking to optimize media relative to where we are in terms of rate adequacy and market opportunity on the non-acquisition expense ratio side, we're always looking to optimize costs. And of course, scale is a part of the way to do that. We have been successful in taking, if you look over the longer run, at least four points out of our cost structure on our non-acquisition expense ratio. Tricia mentioned, it's always a balance in investing and relative to the longer run, but we continue to expect to find opportunities to drive our non-acquisition expense ratio lower across all three of our businesses. Robinson segment. So just for clarity, we do have different commission structures for our Platinum agencies to incent the bundle. And we think we're very competitive with the marketplace when it comes to compensating our independent agents for bundled business as well as monoline business. Fair to say. And I'd add, if we're looking towards PIF growth, new business is one driver, but retention is a far stronger driver of PIF growth. And as Tricia mentioned, we are looking forward to more stable rates this year. We are feeling very adequate in most environments. So we have already enjoyed retention improvements, and we expect to continue to enjoy retention improvements. Competitors are certainly in a better place, but are continuing to raise rates as well. So on a competitiveness basis when the renewals come through, we think we're going to be in a good place, and that will help drive policy in force growth as well. Yes. We are not yet quite back to our all-time high for policy life expectancy. But we're getting there. And our trajectory is certainly indicating that we might be achieving new highs later in the year. We can't project that, obviously. But when you look at the charts, that's what you might conclude. So again, will depend upon the competitive environment. We think we're in a much more stable place, meaning not having to take nearly as much rate as we have historically. The market continues to rise, and we think it's going to play well to policyholder retention. Sorry. I just wanted to give a little greater appreciation of how we spend. We do it in an extremely surgical and analytical manner. We have loads in our pricing by customer segment at a very finite level. And so we understand what we can spend to and meet our lifetime combined ratio targets on each customer segment. So as we go into spend, we are not targeting an expense ratio to Pat's point, we are being extremely surgical and targeted in going after customer segments where we know we can spend up to that allowable cost that we have priced into the product at the segment level. A little different approach than I think you're thinking. They flow as a contract expense on the area in that combined ratio. Yes. So we don't have anything definitive to offer Elyse, but you can generally think of us targeting retention in generally the same area. I can't guarantee it will be exactly the same. We have, as we de-risked the property portfolio been enjoying decreasing PMLs. So that helps us at the top of the tower because we might not have to buy as much. But generally speaking, you can think of the focus and the structure of the CAT Program at June 1 is very similar to what we have today."

I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we'll use the balance of the 60 minutes schedule for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\nSusan Griffith: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. At the end of the second quarter, we were in a difficult place. Rising loss cost, adverse development and catastrophic weather events meant we were facing a significant uphill battle to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio target, while facing a very uncertain future. We made difficult decisions to steer the business through this challenging time. Despite the headwinds, I believed in our strategy and the leaders who are in charge of delivering that strategy. While we knew it wouldn't be easy, we knew that if we execute it properly, we come out better on the other side. While there is still much uncertainty in our future and more work to do, the results in the third quarter suggest our strategy is working. Before discussing what did happen in the third quarter, let's first discuss what did not happen. First, unlike the first half of the year, the third quarter saw modest company-wide reserve development of only 0.2 points unfavorable across all lines. As we discussed in our presentation during our last call, our reserving group adjusted reserves in the first half tracks many things, including higher severity caused by steepening trends in our fixing vehicle coverages, and higher attorney representation rates in Florida precipitated by House Bill 837. In contrast to the first half, in the third quarter, we saw some flattening in the loss cost trends for fixing and replacing vehicles. We also now believe we have adequately reserved for the higher severity related to pre-House Bill 837 lawsuits. Second, in the third quarter, catastrophe losses were 1.3 points lower in total after reinsurance than the first half of the year. We do not write homeowners in Hawaii. So our exposure to the heart-wrenching Maui fires was limited. After reinsurance, our property catastrophe losses in the third quarter were 28 points lower than the first 6 months of the year. And while Hurricane Idalia was devastating to the people in this path of destruction, the density of homes and autos we insured in that path was relatively low. What did happen in the third quarter is that our rate and non-rate actions had a positive effect on premium and profitability. Including the 4 points of rate we took in the third quarter, we have now taken approximately 16 points in personal auto year-to-date with more of that rate earning in every day. Both Commercial Lines and homeowners also took rate as we looked to address loss trends in those lines. We continue to adjust and refine non-rate actions across the portfolio to help the business we are writing to meet our profitability targets. In addition to improved underwriting results, our net income is also benefiting from the higher interest rate environment. For the first 9 months, our investment portfolio yield is 90 basis points higher, and recurring investment income is 59% higher than the same period last year. With sustained higher interest rates, we expect yields to continue to increase as securities with lower interest rates mature and those funds are reinvested at higher rates. Many of the actions we took and continue to take to address profitability have an adverse impact on unit growth. New apps in personal auto were down 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior year and contributed to a decrease in PIF compared to the end of the second quarter. This is a reflection of our self-imposed pullback in media spend as we seek to manage our combined ratio through the acquisition expense ratio and find the right balance in cohort pricing, which we talked about at length at our last quarterly call. We continue to assess our marketing spend. And as always, we endeavor to find the right balance between profitability and new business growth. While new applications shrank year-over-year in personal auto, retention reflected through our PLE measure continues to be robust at 35% in personal auto on a trailing 3 basis. We believe robust retention, especially in the face of higher rates than a year ago is an indicator that many of our competitors are still tight on underwriting, and we remain competitive in the marketplace. Despite the headwinds created by our profitability actions, our year-over-year growth was very strong. Through September, company-wide PIFs were up 10% year-over-year. Positive year-over-year PIF growth plus higher rates means our premium growth was spectacular with net written premium up 20% year-to-date or $7.9 billion. To put the first 3 quarters premium growth into perspective, we've added the premium equivalent to a top 8 personal auto insurance carrier, which is a truly amazing statistic. Despite the successes that occurred in quarter 3, we are not yet declaring victory. Our calendar year combined ratio currently stands 1.2 points above our 96 target. While loss trends have flattened, they are still elevated. Macroeconomic indicators suggest inflation is abating, but we are vigilant. Given the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, our view of the future could change overnight. We continue to refine our plans for the rest of 2023 and 2024 as new information comes in. We have built a business where we can quickly take advantage of the opportunities the market offers us. So I'm confident that as things change, we will react with the goal of delivering the best-in-class results we expect of ourselves. Finally, as a reminder, and as we've previously announced, beginning this fourth quarter, we will move to reporting results on a Gregorian calendar basis versus our historical approach of a 544 convention. Consequently, for the next year, we will limit historical comparisons on a monthly basis and we will continue such comparisons on a quarterly basis. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions.\nDouglas Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions].\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.\nJian Huang: Just a quick question on the way you think about growth. Obviously, you are getting closer and closer to your 96% targeted combined ratio. Curious as to how should we think about the future growth trajectory going forward? Once -- now that appears that losses are improving, reserving appears to be more manageable, heading into 2024, once you -- assuming you get to a 96% combined ratio in 2023, should -- is it reasonable to assume that you would reaccelerate growth into 2024?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, that's definitely reasonable, Bob. Here's how I'm thinking about it. We obviously have 1.2 points to diminish to get to our 96, we're going to continue to work on that. We're still seeing a pretty hard market out there, so we're getting a lot of ambient shopping. And if you caught the last part of the statement even with us doing the self-imposed pullback from our media spend and from non-rate actions, we were able to grow the company nearly $8 billion compared to the first 9 months of last year. 10% PIF is a little bit higher on the direct auto side. So we're pretty excited about what we were able to achieve this year. And I say that not necessarily for the analytical community out there, but mostly for the 60,000 people that got us there. So profit comes before growth. We'll continue to work on that. And what we'll start to do in the relatively near future, start to pull back some of our non-rate actions. So we have a hierarchy of non-rate actions that we'll look to start to pull back. We can test. There's obviously been a lot of uncertainty out there. So we're going to go -- we're going to be measured. And then we can pull back that next tranche in the hierarchy of non-rate actions. And we just met with our media team and are working on a pretty robust budget that we'll plan to put into effect. We still have, obviously, marketing the rest of this quarter but into 2024. So I would say, we're excited. I will say that there's been a lot of uncertainty. And so we're going to be really diligent and cautious, but our goal is to grow as fast as we can at 96 or better.\nJian Huang: That's very helpful. Maybe pivot a little bit on reserving. On the 10-Q, you had a lot of disclosure on. An explanation on how severity trends are developing over time? But just kind of curious in terms of frequency, specifically on bodily injuries. It looks like frequency normalized, improved quite a bit. Just curious if you have any commentary there around what's causing the frequency numbers to improve? And is that a trend that we should be expecting that it will normalize back to a generally negative frequency number going forward?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. It's really hard to discern frequency. A lot of it has to do with geography mix, CMT mix, it could be -- have to do with our underwriting effect. So I don't really want to focus too much on that because there's just a lot of inputs. What I would say from a stability perspective is we're down overall about 1.5%, 13 to 24 months. So we've been pretty stable as far as frequency overall. What I'll also say is when we look at our UBI data, we are seeing about 15 months of stability where VMTs are still down about 15% pre-COVID. Now again, I can't confirm that, that stability will continue. But what we're seeing is not a lot of more movement to commute hours, and we have some external data that shows that badge swipes in office remained pretty stable at about 50% of office workers working from home versus office. So there is some stability. There's always a lot of inputs and there's always a lot of change that's happening, especially as we talked about rolling back some of our non-rate actions, but it's been stable for quite a while.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: I guess a follow-up on ambient shopping. Should we be thinking about it as kind of looking at the industry's profitability and capital position? And then ultimately, as the industry heals as long as -- as well as Progressive's profit margins healed, the ambient shopping benefit, which is pretty extraordinary kind of should dissipate. How are you guys -- internally, do you guys have your own kind of view? Or has your view evolved at all on the benefit you're getting from kind of lower LTV to CAC and ambient shopping?\nSusan Griffith: How I think about that, Mike, is it's been a hard market for a while. We did get out in front of rates to begin with, and then again at the beginning of this year as we saw the trends change specifically in severity of fixing cars. So getting out in front of that, when others might be behind, we're going to get that ambient shopping. We watch it really closely in the auction environment. And the great part about that is that you can get a really low cost per sale. So we'll watch that, but we will definitely put on the gas as needed if we feel like the market is softening at all. I can't really speak to what other competitors do, but I imagine that they're trying to get to their target profit margins, and that means they're going to put a lot of rate out there, which means shopping is going to happen, and that's how we get that business.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Mike, I'd add. Much of the ambient shopping today, we are dissuading from purchasing a policy with Progressive. So as Tricia was saying, we are going to pull back on some of the non-rate actions we've had in place that had been obviously designed to improve profitability. And as we do so, more of those ambient shoppers are going to get through to potentially buy a Progressive policy. So we have some, what I'll call, unmet demand out there that as we're more adequately priced will become growth.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, I was hoping to switch gears to the TNC business on the commercial side. There's been a lot of growth there, you've taken a lot of market share to peers. I'm assuming that, that business is coming to you at hefty price increases. But it's also been a cause of reserve development. I guess any color you can offer on what's going on with that business? And just lastly, does this business come with a bigger new business penalty than other parts of personal auto or commercial non-TNC?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, I'll start with the last part. I think what it comes with is sometimes we don't necessarily know that product in the state. So just like any new business, where we're learning the cost associated with it, we've seen that in TNC. So said another way, the more mature states that we've had are performing much better. But you're right on the rate increases. We've over doubled the rate since 2021 in the TNC business. And specifically, what we are seeing is the rate increases are driven by just a few states. And those states have some structural challenges relating to limit mixes, specifically UM/UIM. So what we've been doing with both of our customers is really gathering the data that we have. We have a treasure trove of data being the largest commercial auto writer. And then they have their own data. We obviously separate and bifurcate the two companies, but talk with them about how to get to the right rates in a more timely fashion and work with them to develop approaches just around flexibility. So think of 6-month policies or greater segmentation. And that's what we're working on right now. I can't go into a lot of specifics because it is proprietary, but we're working very closely to get the rate we need, specifically in the states I talked about with the high UM/UIM limits. And the other states, we're more comfortable with because they're performing better.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: So first, I had a question on Commercial Line reserves. We had an issue for several months where you guys had consistent adverse development in the personal auto side, and I think in September, you had adverse development on the commercial side as well. So maybe discuss what the drivers of that were and what gives you the confidence that this is sort of not the beginning of a trend where adverse development might continue for a few months in Commercial Lines as well?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. So we saw some of the similar things we did in private passenger auto in Commercial Lines. Really the two factors, the one I just talked about was the TNC reserves in those specific states and the other was late reported injury claims. And I think those make up the majority of the Commercial Lines. We'll continue to look. We obviously feel in some of the reserving that Gary and his team have looked at it pretty deeply. So think of the Florida House Bill 837, think of fixing cars. And Gary will continue to look at those high limit states throughout the year to make sure we're adequately reserved for Commercial Lines as well.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then secondly on your expense ratio, has the decline been mostly driven by just a proactive view on your part to pull back from the market while you're seeking price hikes and not be as active on marketing? Or are there any structural changes in the and exemptions as well?\nSusan Griffith: Well, we're always looking to reduce expenses, especially on the non-acquisition expense ratio. But we've pulled back significantly in advertising, and that obviously hits the expense ratio as well as the increase in premium.\nJimmy Bhullar: And you'll come back, I guess. What do you need to see before you start coming back into the market with more marketing spending?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. We have -- even if you look at our marketing spend and the reduction, we spend a significant amount on marketing and that will continue into the fourth quarter of pre-planned spends that we already have. But like I said, what we're going to do is be really cautious and initially start to roll back non-rate actions, and we have a robust media spend planned for 2024. Again, that's a plan. So that is one lever where we can pull forward if we think there's a lot of business we had as long as we're making our target profit margins or pull back if we find ourselves in the place that we did in the first half of 2023.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Two questions. So first, do you see any potential impact from the UAW strike which is hopefully behind us now?\nSusan Griffith: We do a little bit because even though the strike wasn't that long, I think, around 8 weeks total. There's about 12 to 18 weeks before we start to see recovery in some of the parts as well as new vehicles being made. So immediately, when we saw the strike happen, John Murphy and his group went into the sort of mode of sensitivity analysis around this. We have deployed and executed a plan on that. And our main issue for this next 12 or so weeks is really to just minimize the disruption in both our customers and the company.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. So near-term impact potentially, but not really beyond 12 to 16 weeks or so?\nSusan Griffith: That's what we're thinking. Of course, every now we'll watch just like all of the data and especially as we continue to earn in more rate towards the states that we're adequately priced, it may not have any impact. The thing we worry about the most is delays in fixing vehicles, which has been a concern going forward in the past, I should say, just based on talent in the body shops and having the right mechanics to do that, but we'll be able to see that really quickly and react to that should we need to.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then my second question, maybe you can help us think through this. So you've implemented a lot of rate in personal auto, still earning a good chunk of that as well. You're talking about some stabilization of the loss trends. So if and when you accelerate this growth on a much healthier rate adequacy, do you expect that to ultimately improve the loss ratio? Or is the immediate impact still an adverse impact because of the new business penalty?\nSusan Griffith: Well, if we spend more on marketing, there is a new business penalty. But if we believe we are putting new units on the book at a lifetime 96 or cohort 96 calendar year, then we feel good about it. And we'll price to that. We are very efficient in our media spend, and we'll price to that. And really, we feel better every day in all products as each day goes by as more rate earns in. But we know that's part of new business and we're happy to do it if we think we can make the target profit margin that we go to.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: Looking at competitor behavior, I don't need to speak about individual competitors, but GEICO lost a lot of customers over the past year and I look at some other publicly traded companies. And the leakage of policies has not been so significant elsewhere where I can tell yet Progressive has grown dramatically. And thinking about the year to come and the year that's passed, when you think about captive independent and direct channels, where has most of the market share growth that Progressive has achieved come from? And next year for a company like GEICO becomes more aggressive in its desire to add new customers, does that change the calculus on what the market share gains and the type of customers might be in the new year?\nSusan Griffith: Well, I think we're a growth company, Josh, and I think we're going to try to do anything we can to grow as long as we make our target profit margins. We understand where much of our business is coming through because we know the proof of the prior carrier. And so it's been not just GEICO, but other companies, I don't want to talk specifically about the percentage of where it's come from. But it really depends on are people priced right in the market? Do they have the right brand? Do they care about expense ratio, which keeps the prices competitive? And so for us, it's really -- and we've talked about before, it's making sure that we have all 4 of our strategic pillars, really starting with our people and culture and then going on to our brand, competitive prices and broad coverage. And that's where I think we're able to win and continue to grow. We can react very quickly when our competitors do have actions. And really, that's our focus, is to make sure that we have those 4 strategic pillars and that we invest in all of them to continue to be a high-growth company.\nUnidentified Company Representative: The thing to consider there, Josh, is which segments we're growing in would be somewhat indicative of where they're coming from. So we are continuing to grow well in the more preferred segments of our business, the Robinsons, but also we call rights who are homeowners that do not bundle yet their home and auto with Progressive. And we have not been growing, actually this year, we've been shrinking a little bit on the standard end. So the nonstandard end of the spectrum. So that bodes really well for our future growth because, obviously, those customers stick with us longer. And I think where they come from is important, but also whom we're bringing into our customer set is a really important way to think about it.\nJoshua Shanker: And given that answer, is there a way of bifurcating or segmenting the property business such that -- I guess, the question is what percentage of the business is operating at a 96% or better and growing as fast as it can. Obviously, there are some states where you're not there yet and maybe it's segmented by state, but to what extent have you achieved the goal of the property business running the way you want it in the geographies that you operate?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think we start with what we started with about a year ago, and that was to derisk the book and have less new apps and policies in volatile states and more in nonvolatile. And you saw the data on that in the queue that we believe we're doing a great job. We're non-renewing about 115,000 policies in Florida, we're just over indexed in Florida. And so we love Florida. We have a lot of Robinsons. We have a lot of autos and we continue to have a lot of homes, but we were not making money and we needed to non-renew some. So that will happen over the next year or so. We knew it would take a long time. But I think really what our strategy is on the property channel is not unlike it was years ago in the auto channel. We're investing more in segmentation, we're investing more in understanding rate to risk and the necessary need for reinsurance, but we will get there. And obviously, third quarter was a lot better than it was in the past. And there's a lot of buzz because Ian came off, and there wasn't as many storms. But we feel good about our plan, it will still take some time to execute, but we're in the heart of that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I want to step back to your comments about the non-rate action. And it sounds like you're getting ready to dial back some of those actions. Can you remind us exactly what some of those actions were? Did they include any things around commission or fees to lead gen companies? Do you expect those things to change over the next year?\nSusan Griffith: I'll let Pat comment on that. It was less about commissions and more on our strategy around some underwriting paid plans. But Pat, do you want to talk about that a little bit?\nPatrick Callahan: Yes, Greg. Tricia's comments are centered around kind of John's comments as well around how much business we let in the front door. So we have more restricted bill plans in place. We have more verification to require additional checks and make sure we get the accurate information on the risks that are coming in the door to ensure we're priced adequately. So that's -- when we talk about non-rate actions, those are the primary things that we are leaning into lifting in some markets as we approach the end of the year. Your point about lead gen and actually spending more, that would be a 2024 thing, where once we're confident that we put the 96 in the books for calendar year '23, then we would start investing more to generate demand as needed. And we've been out of the market for a while in those markets. So we do expect that, that will ramp back up, but it will be a ramp as we spend only what we need to, to efficiently and cost-effectively attract customers. We've seen that the hard market persists. We've seen there's a lot of competitors who still need to push rate through their systems and a lot right annual policies. So there's still a lot of rate effect to be had in the market on consumers. And we'll lean into that as we get more into the new year from a spend perspective.\nCharles Peters: Great. I guess the other question, pivoting to some of the previous comments around the property business. You're definitely trending in the right direction from a combined ratio perspective, but it's still running above your 96 target for corporate-wide. Is it your objective that -- or your view that you're going to get that property business to a 96 combined ratio next year? It seems like it's been a drag on your consolidated results for several years now. I just -- or maybe you're using it as a loss leader to grab share in the Robinsons cohort? Just some updated views on that would be helpful.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. We're not attempting to use it as a loss leader, I'll tell you that. It has been a drag. Overtime, when you look back, home has done pretty well. Now what we did was we should have probably seen the need to derisk a little bit in states like Florida, Texas, Louisiana and across the country. That's why we're doing that now. That's why we're investing in technology and segmentation, new product models. So we do feel good. We have different target profit margins depending on if you're bundled or not, et cetera. But no, our desire -- I can't predict the future. I have no idea what's going to happen next year. But our goal is to continue our plan to derisk and make the target margins that we have in property and have that be a robust part of our book because we know the Robinsons cohort is super important to our future.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And we have actually been exceeding the objectives we set out for the 2023 period in terms of growing more where we think -- historically, results are far less volatile in property and shrinking considerably in areas including Florida, as Tricia noted, that have been way more volatile from a weather perspective historically. And just to the 96 point, as Tricia was noting, we priced to an aggregate 96 for the company. So by segment, we actually have different combined ratio targets and we think about those as all deriving a return on capital equivalent to or better than the personal auto business. So the 96 calendar year is our commitment to achieve that in aggregate. But below that, we are pricing the different targets based on the characteristics of each business.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: So I had a -- my first question was just on the auto accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, and last quarter, in the presentation, you spoke about mix shift between renewal and new business and the benefit that, that could have having less new business could have on the loss ration. I'm wondering if you can just size how much of the improvement in the loss ratio this quarter is coming from just that lower new business as opposed to improvement on the renewal book?\nSusan Griffith: That's pretty tough to size and I think when we obviously renew, we will know more about you as a customer, but when we bring new business on, our intentions are that we reach our target profit margin.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And I would offer that the rate actions we've taken have far larger influence on that accident year loss ratio than the new renewal mix. So as we noted, we had 5 points earned in just in the third quarter alone for our personal auto business. On a year-to-date basis, it's more than double that number. So when you get the denominator up significantly, that's the best way to improve. Well, that's -- obviously, there's the numerator, but that is where we have gotten most of the loss ratio improvement from. Obviously, severity moderating a bit this quarter has helped us considerably as well. But the rate that we've taken and continue to take is earning in and you're seeing that in the loss ratio.\nDavid Motemaden: And then just a question, I guess, just on -- it seems like -- I mean, the retention has definitely been better than I would have thought. It's obviously a hard market out there. I guess has that surprised you at all and influenced at all how you guys are thinking about growth and maybe adding a little bit more business in 2024, just given how strong the retention is on the renewal book. And Pat, as you just said, that seems to have a better or more profound impact on the loss ratio than the new business?\nSusan Griffith: I mean, I don't know if it surprised us because we watched the data. It certainly is -- delights us, I would say that. And what we want to do, really, the thing with retention is having some stable rates. And we have been increasing rates as has the competition in an extraordinary fashion based on inflation trends. So what we'd love to do is have tremendous growth in 2024, but have some stability around the trends. And I was saying I haven't been able to say on this call for a while, small bites of the Apple where we take a really small rate and our customers feel that makes sense and they don't shop. So that's our goal. But we're very happy with the retention of both the trailing 3 and a trailing 12. We'd like to see some stability, and we will grow as fast as we can as long as we see that stability.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And I'll state the obvious, but we're coming off a fairly low point in terms of retention last year. So last year, we were ahead of the market in taking rate, and I would think of it in sort of like maybe 10 points ahead of the market in terms of taking rate that we saw the need for. And as our customers got those rate increases, they shop and they could still find a better rate. Competitors now have caught up, and in some cases, actually surpassed us on rate take and consequently, even though our rates continue to rise as customers shop, they're less able to find a better rate. And so our year-over-year renewal rates, the changes are robust and we're getting back closer to PLEs lifetime expectancies that we've enjoyed previously. We're not yet back up to historical highs, but as Tricia noted, we're delighted with the trends we're seeing, and we think they're going to continue.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, you guys pointed out, right, that you're a little bit above the 96% year-to-date. You guys have a sense of what rate you're going to earn in, in the fourth quarter, right? And it sounds like loss trend, right, in the Q3 got better relative to the Q2. So I'm sure you have expectations there as well. So what's like the biggest swing variable as we go into the next few months of earnings with whether you ultimately get below that 96% target for the year?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think weather is huge. And so watching that closely. We have another 3 points to earn in on the private passenger auto side. On the Commercial Line side, we've been earning in rate from both '21 -- '22 and '23 revision. But a lot of our improvement, we believe, in Commercial Lines calendar year as been through non-rate actions. And so we're headed into '24 with a lot of rate really starting to earn on the commercial line side. But we do some analysis quite often of what we think we need to do to get there. We care deeply about expenses. So as a company, we've been trying to reduce expenses and we can continuously do that. And I think weather is going to be the big variable, Elyse.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, advertising has come up a bunch on this call. So it sounds like the clock, obviously, in the calendar right, resets, we get to the start of next year. So will -- is that when you expect to kind of push more advertising considering we're restarting and then you can go for the 96% next year? I'm just trying to think through the thought process around when you ultimately turn on the marketing machine. And then how do you balance not growing too fast too soon, recognizing right, that's what happened at the start of this year?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I can let Pat comment a little bit, but our intentions are if we see -- if weather is sort of normal in the next several months. And we see some of the non-rate actions that we're pulling back on to achieve new business, then we are going to be able to likely put a lot more media spend into play in the first quarter. But a lot of that depends on what we're seeing. A lot of it depends on how much we need to. But I think that excites us because we do sort of get the start of -- the clock starts over. But Pat, do you want to add anything?\nPatrick Callahan: Yes. The only thing I would add is last first quarter. So first quarter of 2023, we had sort of the perfect storm of lots of ad spend in a really hard market. And what we don't yet know is how much ambient shopping remains in market and how much shopping fatigue could be in market. So John's point about when shopping pays off because you find a lower price that reinforces or rewards that. If consumers shop in the first quarter and our rates are similar to where they are, there may not be as much ambient shopping and switching available in market. So we don't yet know. But as Tricia mentioned, there's markets where we're off most markets for local advertising today, but there were markets we were off at the start of this year too. So it's very dynamic based on our lifetime expectation of hitting our profit targets for new business that we generate during the period. So dynamic system, and you're right that we will start spending more after the first of the year, but we will be leaning into that and ramping that up as needed depending on how much is available in the ambient market and which markets we feel we've got adequate rates to support the ad spend.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: I'm just curious and kind of going maybe a little bit to Elyse's question. Given the experience we saw earlier this year where you guys are growing really quickly and then all of a sudden, you saw this pop in inflationary pressures, and given the continued uncertainty just from a macroeconomic perspective, are you probably going to -- are you going to be a little more cautious to kind of open up that growth engine this time around, maybe get a little bit more data under your belts before you're going to go after it?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, I think we will be more cautious, and that's why -- that's sort of the beauty around the 96 and the discipline around the 96, whether it's on a calendar year or a cohort year. And that's why we'll slowly pull back, watch, test, and we'll only be pulling back in the states where we feel like we've got enough rate. And so that's a little bit of a limiting factor. But we want to grow, but I do think that there's been so much uncertainty that we will watch it closely. So we aren't in the same position where we have to crank up rates like we did this year.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. And then the second question, Tricia and I, we haven't talked about this topic just for a while, and I saw it in a letter to the BOP business. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how the rollout on the BOP is going. I know you're in 46 states. How is the profitability trend in that business relative to what you kind of thought it was going to be? And at some point, are we going to see that start to kind of ramp up from a growth perspective?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, we're super excited about how many states we are in BOP, it's still a relatively small part of the business. So we won't actually comment on it publicly. And it is -- we have targets, and of course, with new business, when you think about acquisition costs and understanding loss costs, it's obviously going to be higher than stable business, but it is what we expect and so we'll continue to watch that and grow the business as we get more comfortable.\nBrian Meredith: Great. So no surprises so far?\nSusan Griffith: Exactly. Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel.\nMeyer Shields: As we get back to what should be normal, is there any way of quantifying both in terms of growth and profitability how much impact the fact that you're fully pricing to the telematics curves have had before COVID? I assume that you're probably generating excess profits for growing a little bit less quickly than you could have been?\nSusan Griffith: Well, we don't price fully to the curve. We have expanded on both the surcharge and the discount. I think it's pretty tough to quantify to that is really what I'd say.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So I think Tricia is right, we've been expanding our offering to price closer to the curve over time, and we've been expanding to continuous monitoring in the UBI world to collect more data and to be able to more continuously price policies more accurately. As far as specific quantification of how much growth is coming from and the profit coming from it, I wouldn't comment on that at this point. And it's a meaningful piece of our business. It's our most powerful rating variable. And we continue to invest in both the technology to lower the expense of collecting data and to analyze the data more precisely to price more accurately over time on a continuous basis. So I think we're in probably 50% of our earned premium states. I think 29 states have continuous monitoring at this point in time. So we feel really good about continuing to invest to maintain or even widen that moat that we think we have in the issues-based insurance space.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. The second question, and again, this is more thematic. There are clearly a lot of smaller personal auto insurers out there that frankly probably can't compete. Does Progressive look at the option of maybe buying renewal rights as opposed to simply outcompeting in the marketplace? Is that more or less economically efficient?\nSusan Griffith: I think that depends. We always look to -- if we can do book rolls. But like you said, a smaller company is going to have a more difficult time investing in technology, segmentation, brand, distribution and so as you've seen in this last couple of years, we've gotten some of that on itself. So I wouldn't want to pay a premium to get that -- to get those policies on our book. I think we can get them regardless just based on our size and our efficiency.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Just some quick math. You achieved 16% year-to-date rate increases in auto. And in the 10-Q, you said that you plan to take an additional 3% in 4Q, so that will get us something like 19% for the full year. I think last quarter, you penciled in 17% personal auto rate increases for the full year. So it feels like you need to take more rate now. It's not a lot, but can you share the key drivers behind this additional rate needs?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean I think -- I don't know that I would read too much into a point difference. Sometimes, it could be a delay in having it approved. We have to go through each department, but the same trends that we have been seeing, that we've talked about are what the rate is about. So whether it's attorney reps or fixing cars, so [indiscernible] comment any more on that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Our forward-looking rate action statements its dynamic, obviously, as you know, and it is down to the state and segment level. So it's important to remind how we manage the business. We have product managers who manage at the state and product level, and even in some cases, lower than that, and they are all assessing what is going on in their specific marketplaces, trends, projecting the trends, understanding as we noted, what they plan to do in terms of non-rate actions as well as ad spend. So there's a lot that goes into the aggregate rate changes we take and that we say we plan to take. And again, it's going to be dynamic. We obviously have seen severity moderate back down to the single digits, which is fantastic. Where that goes, it's tough to know. But from what we can see, we think we're moving it to a more normal environment when it comes to change in claim severity. But in aggregate, it's very hard to dissect that 19 or 17, and it's changed today. I assure you.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Great. It also looks like you had modest favorable personal auto prior year development this quarter. The adverse mostly came from commercial lines. Was that because you feel good about adequately reserving the Florida [indiscernible] reform? Were there other factors? And I'm curious if you're seeing reopen claims in the quarter?\nSusan Griffith: That's exactly right. We're feeling much more confident in both the House Bill and fixing cars.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And I know you touched on it last quarter, but can you remind me what caused the reopen claims in the first half of the year that you haven't seen in the past? What it changed?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean, there's a couple of things that happen, but you can write an estimate. And then when the person, the customer, whether it's an insurer or claimant, goes to get the car repaired, so we paid -- we've made that payment, the feature is closed. And it gets into the shop and they find more damage and it's maybe delayed repair, it increases rental. So it really was the lead time with -- to get parts. It's labor rates, it's length of time, so rentals increased. So there are a couple of different factors that have gone into fixing cars.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And on the injury side, there was a lot of Florida influence there -- I'm sorry. And so House Bill 837 drove an influx of attorney representation and lawsuits and we had to take reserve increases to reflect what we believe the future cost of setting where the claims would be.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So you don't wait until an actual claim closes, you estimate what the close would look like. Was it maybe perhaps premature in calling those claims closed?\nSusan Griffith: No. It's the way our system works. So we have reserves set for different line coverages. And then if those change and they change dynamically not one file or two files, that's when we know we need to strengthen our reserves.\nUnidentified Company Representative: But yes, we are absolutely estimating the ultimate loss cost with the best information we have at this time.\nSusan Griffith: I think it's very common in our business to have supplements because you can have parts of vehicles that are -- you can't even see. So suspension and other parts. So you write what you can see, you shouldn't write more or less. And then as the claim evolves, especially with collision or property damage, you'll be able to see more. Sometimes it's nothing, but there could be supplements. But that's really common.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: Just one on Florida. So I guess now that the -- I guess, the pig has made its way through the python in terms of reserving mostly. Are you seeing any positive influences from the legislation on the recently written business? I know you guys have a big pit book in Florida? Or is it just too soon to tell?\nSusan Griffith: I'd think it's too soon to tell. We anticipate that it will be positive, but we have to let this play out a bit.\nDouglas Constantine: That appears to have been our last question. So that concludes our event. So I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Third Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Patrick Callahan",
            "content": "Yes, Greg. Tricia's comments are centered around kind of John's comments as well around how much business we let in the front door. So we have more restricted bill plans in place. We have more verification to require additional checks and make sure we get the accurate information on the risks that are coming in the door to ensure we're priced adequately. So that's -- when we talk about non-rate actions, those are the primary things that we are leaning into lifting in some markets as we approach the end of the year. Your point about lead gen and actually spending more, that would be a 2024 thing, where once we're confident that we put the 96 in the books for calendar year '23, then we would start investing more to generate demand as needed. And we've been out of the market for a while in those markets. So we do expect that, that will ramp back up, but it will be a ramp as we spend only what we need to, to efficiently and cost-effectively attract customers. We've seen that the hard market persists. We've seen there's a lot of competitors who still need to push rate through their systems and a lot right annual policies. So there's still a lot of rate effect to be had in the market on consumers. And we'll lean into that as we get more into the new year from a spend perspective. Yes. The only thing I would add is last first quarter. So first quarter of 2023, we had sort of the perfect storm of lots of ad spend in a really hard market. And what we don't yet know is how much ambient shopping remains in market and how much shopping fatigue could be in market. So John's point about when shopping pays off because you find a lower price that reinforces or rewards that. If consumers shop in the first quarter and our rates are similar to where they are, there may not be as much ambient shopping and switching available in market. So we don't yet know. But as Tricia mentioned, there's markets where we're off most markets for local advertising today, but there were markets we were off at the start of this year too. So it's very dynamic based on our lifetime expectation of hitting our profit targets for new business that we generate during the period. So dynamic system, and you're right that we will start spending more after the first of the year, but we will be leaning into that and ramping that up as needed depending on how much is available in the ambient market and which markets we feel we've got adequate rates to support the ad spend."

            "name": "Susan Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. At the end of the second quarter, we were in a difficult place. Rising loss cost, adverse development and catastrophic weather events meant we were facing a significant uphill battle to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio target, while facing a very uncertain future. We made difficult decisions to steer the business through this challenging time. Despite the headwinds, I believed in our strategy and the leaders who are in charge of delivering that strategy. While we knew it wouldn't be easy, we knew that if we execute it properly, we come out better on the other side. While there is still much uncertainty in our future and more work to do, the results in the third quarter suggest our strategy is working. Before discussing what did happen in the third quarter, let's first discuss what did not happen. First, unlike the first half of the year, the third quarter saw modest company-wide reserve development of only 0.2 points unfavorable across all lines. As we discussed in our presentation during our last call, our reserving group adjusted reserves in the first half tracks many things, including higher severity caused by steepening trends in our fixing vehicle coverages, and higher attorney representation rates in Florida precipitated by House Bill 837. In contrast to the first half, in the third quarter, we saw some flattening in the loss cost trends for fixing and replacing vehicles. We also now believe we have adequately reserved for the higher severity related to pre-House Bill 837 lawsuits. Second, in the third quarter, catastrophe losses were 1.3 points lower in total after reinsurance than the first half of the year. We do not write homeowners in Hawaii. So our exposure to the heart-wrenching Maui fires was limited. After reinsurance, our property catastrophe losses in the third quarter were 28 points lower than the first 6 months of the year. And while Hurricane Idalia was devastating to the people in this path of destruction, the density of homes and autos we insured in that path was relatively low. What did happen in the third quarter is that our rate and non-rate actions had a positive effect on premium and profitability. Including the 4 points of rate we took in the third quarter, we have now taken approximately 16 points in personal auto year-to-date with more of that rate earning in every day. Both Commercial Lines and homeowners also took rate as we looked to address loss trends in those lines. We continue to adjust and refine non-rate actions across the portfolio to help the business we are writing to meet our profitability targets. In addition to improved underwriting results, our net income is also benefiting from the higher interest rate environment. For the first 9 months, our investment portfolio yield is 90 basis points higher, and recurring investment income is 59% higher than the same period last year. With sustained higher interest rates, we expect yields to continue to increase as securities with lower interest rates mature and those funds are reinvested at higher rates. Many of the actions we took and continue to take to address profitability have an adverse impact on unit growth. New apps in personal auto were down 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior year and contributed to a decrease in PIF compared to the end of the second quarter. This is a reflection of our self-imposed pullback in media spend as we seek to manage our combined ratio through the acquisition expense ratio and find the right balance in cohort pricing, which we talked about at length at our last quarterly call. We continue to assess our marketing spend. And as always, we endeavor to find the right balance between profitability and new business growth. While new applications shrank year-over-year in personal auto, retention reflected through our PLE measure continues to be robust at 35% in personal auto on a trailing 3 basis. We believe robust retention, especially in the face of higher rates than a year ago is an indicator that many of our competitors are still tight on underwriting, and we remain competitive in the marketplace. Despite the headwinds created by our profitability actions, our year-over-year growth was very strong. Through September, company-wide PIFs were up 10% year-over-year. Positive year-over-year PIF growth plus higher rates means our premium growth was spectacular with net written premium up 20% year-to-date or $7.9 billion. To put the first 3 quarters premium growth into perspective, we've added the premium equivalent to a top 8 personal auto insurance carrier, which is a truly amazing statistic. Despite the successes that occurred in quarter 3, we are not yet declaring victory. Our calendar year combined ratio currently stands 1.2 points above our 96 target. While loss trends have flattened, they are still elevated. Macroeconomic indicators suggest inflation is abating, but we are vigilant. Given the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, our view of the future could change overnight. We continue to refine our plans for the rest of 2023 and 2024 as new information comes in. We have built a business where we can quickly take advantage of the opportunities the market offers us. So I'm confident that as things change, we will react with the goal of delivering the best-in-class results we expect of ourselves. Finally, as a reminder, and as we've previously announced, beginning this fourth quarter, we will move to reporting results on a Gregorian calendar basis versus our historical approach of a 544 convention. Consequently, for the next year, we will limit historical comparisons on a monthly basis and we will continue such comparisons on a quarterly basis. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions. Yes, that's definitely reasonable, Bob. Here's how I'm thinking about it. We obviously have 1.2 points to diminish to get to our 96, we're going to continue to work on that. We're still seeing a pretty hard market out there, so we're getting a lot of ambient shopping. And if you caught the last part of the statement even with us doing the self-imposed pullback from our media spend and from non-rate actions, we were able to grow the company nearly $8 billion compared to the first 9 months of last year. 10% PIF is a little bit higher on the direct auto side. So we're pretty excited about what we were able to achieve this year. And I say that not necessarily for the analytical community out there, but mostly for the 60,000 people that got us there. So profit comes before growth. We'll continue to work on that. And what we'll start to do in the relatively near future, start to pull back some of our non-rate actions. So we have a hierarchy of non-rate actions that we'll look to start to pull back. We can test. There's obviously been a lot of uncertainty out there. So we're going to go -- we're going to be measured. And then we can pull back that next tranche in the hierarchy of non-rate actions. And we just met with our media team and are working on a pretty robust budget that we'll plan to put into effect. We still have, obviously, marketing the rest of this quarter but into 2024. So I would say, we're excited. I will say that there's been a lot of uncertainty. And so we're going to be really diligent and cautious, but our goal is to grow as fast as we can at 96 or better. Yes. It's really hard to discern frequency. A lot of it has to do with geography mix, CMT mix, it could be -- have to do with our underwriting effect. So I don't really want to focus too much on that because there's just a lot of inputs. What I would say from a stability perspective is we're down overall about 1.5%, 13 to 24 months. So we've been pretty stable as far as frequency overall. What I'll also say is when we look at our UBI data, we are seeing about 15 months of stability where VMTs are still down about 15% pre-COVID. Now again, I can't confirm that, that stability will continue. But what we're seeing is not a lot of more movement to commute hours, and we have some external data that shows that badge swipes in office remained pretty stable at about 50% of office workers working from home versus office. So there is some stability. There's always a lot of inputs and there's always a lot of change that's happening, especially as we talked about rolling back some of our non-rate actions, but it's been stable for quite a while. How I think about that, Mike, is it's been a hard market for a while. We did get out in front of rates to begin with, and then again at the beginning of this year as we saw the trends change specifically in severity of fixing cars. So getting out in front of that, when others might be behind, we're going to get that ambient shopping. We watch it really closely in the auction environment. And the great part about that is that you can get a really low cost per sale. So we'll watch that, but we will definitely put on the gas as needed if we feel like the market is softening at all. I can't really speak to what other competitors do, but I imagine that they're trying to get to their target profit margins, and that means they're going to put a lot of rate out there, which means shopping is going to happen, and that's how we get that business. Yes, I'll start with the last part. I think what it comes with is sometimes we don't necessarily know that product in the state. So just like any new business, where we're learning the cost associated with it, we've seen that in TNC. So said another way, the more mature states that we've had are performing much better. But you're right on the rate increases. We've over doubled the rate since 2021 in the TNC business. And specifically, what we are seeing is the rate increases are driven by just a few states. And those states have some structural challenges relating to limit mixes, specifically UM/UIM. So what we've been doing with both of our customers is really gathering the data that we have. We have a treasure trove of data being the largest commercial auto writer. And then they have their own data. We obviously separate and bifurcate the two companies, but talk with them about how to get to the right rates in a more timely fashion and work with them to develop approaches just around flexibility. So think of 6-month policies or greater segmentation. And that's what we're working on right now. I can't go into a lot of specifics because it is proprietary, but we're working very closely to get the rate we need, specifically in the states I talked about with the high UM/UIM limits. And the other states, we're more comfortable with because they're performing better. Yes. So we saw some of the similar things we did in private passenger auto in Commercial Lines. Really the two factors, the one I just talked about was the TNC reserves in those specific states and the other was late reported injury claims. And I think those make up the majority of the Commercial Lines. We'll continue to look. We obviously feel in some of the reserving that Gary and his team have looked at it pretty deeply. So think of the Florida House Bill 837, think of fixing cars. And Gary will continue to look at those high limit states throughout the year to make sure we're adequately reserved for Commercial Lines as well. Well, we're always looking to reduce expenses, especially on the non-acquisition expense ratio. But we've pulled back significantly in advertising, and that obviously hits the expense ratio as well as the increase in premium. Yes. We have -- even if you look at our marketing spend and the reduction, we spend a significant amount on marketing and that will continue into the fourth quarter of pre-planned spends that we already have. But like I said, what we're going to do is be really cautious and initially start to roll back non-rate actions, and we have a robust media spend planned for 2024. Again, that's a plan. So that is one lever where we can pull forward if we think there's a lot of business we had as long as we're making our target profit margins or pull back if we find ourselves in the place that we did in the first half of 2023. We do a little bit because even though the strike wasn't that long, I think, around 8 weeks total. There's about 12 to 18 weeks before we start to see recovery in some of the parts as well as new vehicles being made. So immediately, when we saw the strike happen, John Murphy and his group went into the sort of mode of sensitivity analysis around this. We have deployed and executed a plan on that. And our main issue for this next 12 or so weeks is really to just minimize the disruption in both our customers and the company. That's what we're thinking. Of course, every now we'll watch just like all of the data and especially as we continue to earn in more rate towards the states that we're adequately priced, it may not have any impact. The thing we worry about the most is delays in fixing vehicles, which has been a concern going forward in the past, I should say, just based on talent in the body shops and having the right mechanics to do that, but we'll be able to see that really quickly and react to that should we need to. Well, if we spend more on marketing, there is a new business penalty. But if we believe we are putting new units on the book at a lifetime 96 or cohort 96 calendar year, then we feel good about it. And we'll price to that. We are very efficient in our media spend, and we'll price to that. And really, we feel better every day in all products as each day goes by as more rate earns in. But we know that's part of new business and we're happy to do it if we think we can make the target profit margin that we go to. Well, I think we're a growth company, Josh, and I think we're going to try to do anything we can to grow as long as we make our target profit margins. We understand where much of our business is coming through because we know the proof of the prior carrier. And so it's been not just GEICO, but other companies, I don't want to talk specifically about the percentage of where it's come from. But it really depends on are people priced right in the market? Do they have the right brand? Do they care about expense ratio, which keeps the prices competitive? And so for us, it's really -- and we've talked about before, it's making sure that we have all 4 of our strategic pillars, really starting with our people and culture and then going on to our brand, competitive prices and broad coverage. And that's where I think we're able to win and continue to grow. We can react very quickly when our competitors do have actions. And really, that's our focus, is to make sure that we have those 4 strategic pillars and that we invest in all of them to continue to be a high-growth company. Yes. I think we start with what we started with about a year ago, and that was to derisk the book and have less new apps and policies in volatile states and more in nonvolatile. And you saw the data on that in the queue that we believe we're doing a great job. We're non-renewing about 115,000 policies in Florida, we're just over indexed in Florida. And so we love Florida. We have a lot of Robinsons. We have a lot of autos and we continue to have a lot of homes, but we were not making money and we needed to non-renew some. So that will happen over the next year or so. We knew it would take a long time. But I think really what our strategy is on the property channel is not unlike it was years ago in the auto channel. We're investing more in segmentation, we're investing more in understanding rate to risk and the necessary need for reinsurance, but we will get there. And obviously, third quarter was a lot better than it was in the past. And there's a lot of buzz because Ian came off, and there wasn't as many storms. But we feel good about our plan, it will still take some time to execute, but we're in the heart of that. I'll let Pat comment on that. It was less about commissions and more on our strategy around some underwriting paid plans. But Pat, do you want to talk about that a little bit? Yes. We're not attempting to use it as a loss leader, I'll tell you that. It has been a drag. Overtime, when you look back, home has done pretty well. Now what we did was we should have probably seen the need to derisk a little bit in states like Florida, Texas, Louisiana and across the country. That's why we're doing that now. That's why we're investing in technology and segmentation, new product models. So we do feel good. We have different target profit margins depending on if you're bundled or not, et cetera. But no, our desire -- I can't predict the future. I have no idea what's going to happen next year. But our goal is to continue our plan to derisk and make the target margins that we have in property and have that be a robust part of our book because we know the Robinsons cohort is super important to our future. That's pretty tough to size and I think when we obviously renew, we will know more about you as a customer, but when we bring new business on, our intentions are that we reach our target profit margin. I mean, I don't know if it surprised us because we watched the data. It certainly is -- delights us, I would say that. And what we want to do, really, the thing with retention is having some stable rates. And we have been increasing rates as has the competition in an extraordinary fashion based on inflation trends. So what we'd love to do is have tremendous growth in 2024, but have some stability around the trends. And I was saying I haven't been able to say on this call for a while, small bites of the Apple where we take a really small rate and our customers feel that makes sense and they don't shop. So that's our goal. But we're very happy with the retention of both the trailing 3 and a trailing 12. We'd like to see some stability, and we will grow as fast as we can as long as we see that stability. Yes. I think weather is huge. And so watching that closely. We have another 3 points to earn in on the private passenger auto side. On the Commercial Line side, we've been earning in rate from both '21 -- '22 and '23 revision. But a lot of our improvement, we believe, in Commercial Lines calendar year as been through non-rate actions. And so we're headed into '24 with a lot of rate really starting to earn on the commercial line side. But we do some analysis quite often of what we think we need to do to get there. We care deeply about expenses. So as a company, we've been trying to reduce expenses and we can continuously do that. And I think weather is going to be the big variable, Elyse. Yes. I can let Pat comment a little bit, but our intentions are if we see -- if weather is sort of normal in the next several months. And we see some of the non-rate actions that we're pulling back on to achieve new business, then we are going to be able to likely put a lot more media spend into play in the first quarter. But a lot of that depends on what we're seeing. A lot of it depends on how much we need to. But I think that excites us because we do sort of get the start of -- the clock starts over. But Pat, do you want to add anything? Yes, I think we will be more cautious, and that's why -- that's sort of the beauty around the 96 and the discipline around the 96, whether it's on a calendar year or a cohort year. And that's why we'll slowly pull back, watch, test, and we'll only be pulling back in the states where we feel like we've got enough rate. And so that's a little bit of a limiting factor. But we want to grow, but I do think that there's been so much uncertainty that we will watch it closely. So we aren't in the same position where we have to crank up rates like we did this year. Yes, we're super excited about how many states we are in BOP, it's still a relatively small part of the business. So we won't actually comment on it publicly. And it is -- we have targets, and of course, with new business, when you think about acquisition costs and understanding loss costs, it's obviously going to be higher than stable business, but it is what we expect and so we'll continue to watch that and grow the business as we get more comfortable. Exactly. Yes. Well, we don't price fully to the curve. We have expanded on both the surcharge and the discount. I think it's pretty tough to quantify to that is really what I'd say. I think that depends. We always look to -- if we can do book rolls. But like you said, a smaller company is going to have a more difficult time investing in technology, segmentation, brand, distribution and so as you've seen in this last couple of years, we've gotten some of that on itself. So I wouldn't want to pay a premium to get that -- to get those policies on our book. I think we can get them regardless just based on our size and our efficiency. Yes. I mean I think -- I don't know that I would read too much into a point difference. Sometimes, it could be a delay in having it approved. We have to go through each department, but the same trends that we have been seeing, that we've talked about are what the rate is about. So whether it's attorney reps or fixing cars, so [indiscernible] comment any more on that? That's exactly right. We're feeling much more confident in both the House Bill and fixing cars. Yes. I mean, there's a couple of things that happen, but you can write an estimate. And then when the person, the customer, whether it's an insurer or claimant, goes to get the car repaired, so we paid -- we've made that payment, the feature is closed. And it gets into the shop and they find more damage and it's maybe delayed repair, it increases rental. So it really was the lead time with -- to get parts. It's labor rates, it's length of time, so rentals increased. So there are a couple of different factors that have gone into fixing cars. No. It's the way our system works. So we have reserves set for different line coverages. And then if those change and they change dynamically not one file or two files, that's when we know we need to strengthen our reserves. I think it's very common in our business to have supplements because you can have parts of vehicles that are -- you can't even see. So suspension and other parts. So you write what you can see, you shouldn't write more or less. And then as the claim evolves, especially with collision or property damage, you'll be able to see more. Sometimes it's nothing, but there could be supplements. But that's really common. I'd think it's too soon to tell. We anticipate that it will be positive, but we have to let this play out a bit."

I usually begin these calls by extolling the commitment of Progressive's people and expressing my pride in the results they deliver, and this quarter will be no different. In the face of extraordinary pressure on the industry, our people continue to take the actions necessary to succeed in this difficult environment.  While our results through the first half of 2023 fell well short of our 96 combined ratio target. I continue to believe in our people and our strategy. I believe we have assembled a progressive team of nearly 59,000 employees that's best in class. I have no doubt that we are continuing to lay the groundwork to ensure that our best days are ahead of us. We continue to manage to this calendar year target, maintaining the discipline that has allowed us to grow in the past with better profitability than the industry.  At the same time, we will be pragmatic in our approach to growth and remain cognizant of long-term value, which we continue to believe has served well by balancing growth and profitability. We spent much of the first quarter call talking about actions we would be taking to address our calendar year profitability pressure and those actions continue. In quarter 2, we took 7 points in personal auto, which puts our year-to-date rate take at just over 11%, and assuming regulatory approval, we plan to take approximately 6 additional points during the remainder of the year as we adjust rates to match loss trend.  During last quarter's call, we also said that we would reduce our media spend, resulting in our quarter 2 direct expense ratio being amongst the lowest in recent history. These actions have had the expected effect on growth with new app growth slower in the second quarter as compared to the first and PIF growth, while still robust, slowing from highs we saw in prior months. Calendar year profitability continues to be a challenge. So with the calendar year 96 goal in mind, we will continue to evaluate the rate and non-rate actions we may need to take.  Catastrophe losses were a significant part of our profitability pressures. To date, 2023 has been a significant catastrophic year with some estimates suggesting that U.S. insurer losses have already surpassed $25 billion this year. The events this year had been broadly felt with 44 states affected by 43 events. At the company level, these events have added 4.5 points to our combined ratio year-to-date, which is 1.7 points higher than the impact catastrophe events had on our combined ratio for the first half of 2022.  Our property business has been most affected by catastrophes, adding almost 46 points to the property loss ratio so far this year, which is about 16 points more when compared to this time in 2022. Historically, we have been among the best in the industry in reserve accuracy with reserve changes contributing little to our calendar year combined ratio. We've advanced the science of reserving, an employee team of highly experienced individuals to support our goal of being as accurate as possible with our reserves.  Accurate reserves help us to price more accurately and give us the confidence to grow as fast as we have over the last decade. Having said that, the difficult environment of 2023 has presented challenges for our reserving practices. Through the end of the second quarter, prior year adverse development has contributed 4 points to our combined ratio and current accident year actuarial adjustments have contributed another 1.5 points. The majority of personal lines adverse development can be placed into 2 categories: Florida and fixing vehicle coverages. Florida's prior year adverse development accounts for just over 40% of the 4 points of prior year development. While we continue to be optimistic that March's new legislation will result in lower loss costs over time, the short-term effect has been a significant increase in attorney representation largely in medical coverages.  Our data has matured each month since the bill passed, which has allowed us to continue to fine-tune reserving in the face of changes to Florida's ultimate loss costs. In fixing vehicle coverages, unforeseen severity trends deepening on previously closed claims continues to be the major driver of prior year adverse development countrywide. The contributors to the steeper trends come from a variety of sources, including longer vehicle repair times, longer rental times, higher parts prices and labor rates and changes in subrogation trends. Fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, which explains why over 80% of the total year-to-date prior-year development is from the 2022 accident year.  In fact, excluding Florida, accident years prior to 2022 have developed favorably. Our current year actuarial adjustments are primarily due to fixing vehicle coverages. Since fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, most of the claims that are affected by emerging trends have happened in the recent past. As we have moved deeper into the year, the new steeper trends in fixing vehicle coverages have increasingly affected claims that occurred in the current accident year.  Florida litigation has been a relatively small part of current year actuarial adjustments since the increase in attorney representation rates largely affected claims that occurred before March of 2023. We continue to monitor loss trends across all states and coverages and will adjust if necessary to ensure we're always adequately reserved. While both reserving and pricing have been a challenge this year, I have great confidence in the teams and our strategies, which have delivered results better than the industry for a very long time. To showcase these skill sets, this morning, we have 2 senior leaders to speak to these 2 topics for our presentation. First, Gary Traicoff, our Corporate Actuary business leader and Head of our Reserving Group, will discuss reserving practice at Progressive and how we endeavor to accurately set and adjust reserves. Gary is a 28-year progressive veteran and has led our reserving group for almost 11 of those years. After Gary, Jim Curtis, our Personal Lines Controller, will discuss cohort pricing. Cohort pricing is our term for managing to both our calendar year and lifetime 96 target when new business and renewal business have different expense and loss characteristics. Jim has been with Progressive for 28 years and in his current role for 4.  Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now pass you to Gary. Gary?\nGary Traicoff: Thank you, Tricia, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to talk to you today about loss reserving at Progressive. I will first cover some key definitions and metrics in our general process, then walk through an example on how our overall reserve levels are determined. And finally, walk through an example of the reserving life cycle of an individual claim and how it would flow through the actuarial categories of the earnings release. Let's start off with the size of our loss and loss adjustment expense or LAE reserves. The columns represent our carried reserve balance at the end of each calendar year from 2013 through 2022 and at June 30, 2023, for the rightmost column. On the left side of the graph, we can see that in 2013, Progressive had about $8.5 billion in reserves on a gross of reinsurance basis at year-end 2013. This would be the sum of the orange and blue sections within the bar with our growth as a company, reserves before reinsurance as of June 30, 2023, is now almost $33 billion and almost 4x greater than what it was in 2013, while our premium growth was a little less than 3x greater over the same time period. Much of this difference in reserves outpacing premium growth relates to our growth in longer-tailed products and commercial lines over this period. This means that we believe for all accidents that have occurred through June 30, 2023, our ultimate future liabilities will be almost $33 billion. The orange section of the bars represents how much of our reserves are ceded for reinsurance. Some examples of this include state-regulated plans, such as Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association and the Florida Hurricane Cat Fund and private reinsurers. Our ceded reserves now make up about 16% of our gross reserves versus just over 12% in 2013. Much of this increase in the higher proportion of ceded reserves relates to newer products that have been added over time, including property and protective, which have more reinsurance needs than our historical products. The blue section of the columns represents how much of our reserves are retained after reinsurance, almost $28 billion as of June 30, 2023.  Next, let's look at some metrics on how our reserves are distributed. The chart on the left shows that 67% of our net reserves are in loss case, 17% loss IBNR and the remainder under LAE. Any open claim will be assigned a case reserve that may be set by a claims adjuster or an actuarially derived estimate set by the actuarial team. We will discuss this in more detail in a future slide. IBNR, which stands for incurred but not reported, makes up about 17% of our net reserves. IBNR may have different meanings across companies. For most of Progressive's products, one can think of IBNR as the future liabilities to cover claims that have already happened and are currently not recorded as open case reserves. This would include late reports, reopens and salvage and subrogation recoveries. Anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries can be thought of as a contra reserve and is a reduction to future liabilities. For most of our products, IBNR does not cover any anticipated development in case reserves. This is because since our case reserves are a combination of adjuster estimates and actuarially set case reserves for the majority of our products, our IBNR reserve, does not cover expected case development. LAE reserves make up the remaining 16% and typically cover the anticipated expenses needed to settle claims that have already happened, such as defense counsel costs and claims adjuster salaries. The middle chart shows the distribution of our reserves by product. As expected, reserves will index more to longer-tailed products with higher limits relative to premium size. Thus, our Commercial Lines business makes up almost 1/3 of our total reserves, but a smaller proportion of premium. The graph on the right shows that in personal auto, 83% of our reserves are set to cover injury and medical costs and 17% to cover the cost of fixed vehicles. Again, this is due to the longer-tail nature and higher severity costs to injury and medical coverages versus fixing vehicle coverages and reserves are over-indexed to injury and medical relative to premium. In addition, fixing vehicle coverages have a higher proportion of contra-reserves from salvage and subrogation compared to injury and medical. One additional point. This data is as of year-end 2022 and is on a net of reinsurance basis. While the previous slide gave a high-level overview of the distribution of our reserve mix by various parts, we review the reserves at a much more granular level. We typically review reserves by some combination of product, geographic areas such as group of states, individual states and even down to a region or subset within a state. Further breakouts typically include individual line coverages such as bodily injury, uninsured motor bodily injury and property damage and even by limit. To determine these breakouts, we weigh the credibility of the data, homogeneity in the data and additional value of segmenting the data at a finer level.  For example, in personal auto bodily injury, almost all states are reviewed separately with the majority of states reviewed quarterly. State-level data is credible and many states have different development patterns, which warrant the data to be reviewed separately. In personal auto collision, while state-level data is credible, many states exhibit similar data patterns and several clusters of states are reviewed together. About 25% to 30% of our reserves are reviewed at this in-depth level monthly and about 85% of our reserves quarterly. About 700 reviews, which is some combination of product, state, line, et cetera, are reviewed over the course of the year. By reviewing reserves at this detailed level, we are able to adjust reserves more accurately at a granular level, which helps our pricing teams better match price to risk. We also have a robust roll-forward process that we will discuss later on, which allows up to 100% of the reserves to be adjusted monthly. The roll-forward process allows us the time to do a deep analysis on a portion of the reserves monthly while still feeling comfortable that all of our reserves are being updated monthly. Here is an example of how an in-depth review schedule will look over 3 months. In the first month of the quarter, 57 reserve reviews were completed. Each reserve review is either a loss or LAE review, which is further broken down between defense cost containment or DCC and adjusting and other expenses or A&O. Some combination of products, such as personal auto, CL or one of our core commercial auto products or TNC, which represents transportation network companies, line coverages such as bodily injury and some combination of state is reviewed. These 57 reviews would make up about 25% to 30% of our total reserves. In the following month, 60 reviews were completed. Again, there is some combination of type, product, coverage and state, but all 60 reviews are independent of reviews completed during the first month and represent another 25% to 30% of our total reserves. Finally, the third month of the quarter had 68 reviews completed, which are all different from any reviews completed during the previous 2 months and represent an additional 25% to 30% of the total reserves. Over the course of the quarter, about 85% of the reserves were reviewed. Typically, between 50 to 70 reviews are completed per month. Now let's talk about how the overall reserve level is determined. We use several different methods. One of the methods that we use is called the accident period chain ladder method in a standard industry practice. And the example above, each row represents a 6-month period when the accident occurred and each column represents how much in paid losses had been paid out for those accidents at certain time periods after the accident. For example, the top row represents all accidents that occurred from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The $100 in Column 1 means that the $100 was paid out as of December 31, 2021 for those accidents. Moving to the right of the same row. Column 2 of $120 means that for accidents that occurred during the last 6 months of 2021, as of June 2022, cumulatively that $120 had been paid out. Thus, an additional $20 was paid out during the first half of 2022. The increase of $20 could be due to payments on known claims, late reports or reopen activity. The increase of 20% from $100 to $120 is shown in the loss development factors section in the December 2021 row and column 1.  Similarly, the loss development factor of 1.08 in Column 2 of the December 2021 row is calculated by taking the paid loss of $130 in Column 3, divided by the paid loss of $120 in Column 2 for the December 2021 row. Next, the actuarial analyst selected a 1.27 in the first column as the predicted Column 1 loss development factor for the accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June of 2023. We can see that in the June 2023 row, $120 had been paid out by the end of June 2023. The analyst is predicting that paid losses will increase by 27% or $33 during the second half of 2023 and cumulatively be at $153 by December 2023. Multiplying the $153 by an additional 8% predicts that an additional $12 will get paid out by the third column for a cumulative of $165. Thus, the shaded numbers in blue are predictions of what will be paid out in the future. The indicated reserve is then calculated by taking the ultimate estimated paid losses minus what has already been paid as of June 2023 since reserves are to cover future liabilities. The indicated reserve is $45 for accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June 2023 and $13 for accidents happening during the second half of 2022. In total, the indicated reserve is the sum of all accident periods or rows and adds up to $58. This example illustrates an accident period chain ladder approach using paid data. Triangle, similar to this byproduct and grouped by line coverage can be found in our annual report. Other approaches that we typically employ include using case incurred data, developing severity and frequency separately and stratifying the data by size of loss layer. In addition, data is also segmented by late report and reopen lag time from the date of loss to the date of late report and reopen and hindsight testing to prior reserve amounts are considered as well. Additional ad hoc analysis is typically completed to understand changes in the underlying data and loss development factors. Based on the indications from the multiple reviews completed during the month, the actuarial team will then decide how much of an overall reserve change is needed and adjust reserve factors accordingly. Those changes will show up in the earnings release under the actuarial adjustment section and be reported showing the breakout for the current accident year and all prior accident years. For example, in June of 2023, based off the scheduled reserve reviews, which represented between 25% to 30% of reserves, the actuarial team increased reserves $130.9 million for accident years 2022 and prior and increased reserves $160.3 million for the 2023 accident year for a total change of $291.2 million. The $130.9 million increase to prior accident years directly impacted the prior accident year development. In addition, due to other changes not related to actuarial reviews, prior accident years developed an additional $6.9 million unfavorably for a total amount of unfavorable development of $137.8 million.  Next, we will discuss what are some of the other items that are in all other development. Now let's go through an example of the pathway of a case reserve over time and the impact on our monthly earnings release. Remember, case reserves make up about 67% of our total reserves. In this example, a claim happens on December 15 and is reported and opened in our claims system on December 19. Since the claim was reported in the same month as the occurrence of the accident, this would not be considered an IBNR claim. The adjuster does not have much information about the claim at this point and it sets a case reserve of $5,000, noted by the orange dot. In parallel, a tabular case reserve is determined for this claim from an algorithm used by the actuarial team. The actuarial team uses predictive modeling techniques based off of certain characteristics of the claim and policy to predict what the expected cost would be for all claims that meet the criteria. In personal auto, there are over 200,000 unique combinations of tabular case reserves. It is important to note that the actuarial algorithm does not expect this one claim to pay exactly the tabular case reserve. But on average, all claims that meet the similar criteria should pay close to the tabular case reserve. This is similar to a pricing rate order of calculation formula. In this example, the tabular case reserve is $12,125.  Finally, the adjuster case reserve as compared to a reserve threshold set at $25,000 in this example. If the adjuster estimate is below the reserve threshold, the tabular case reserve is booked to the general leisure as the financial case reserve for that claim and is reflected on the balance sheet. If the adjuster case reserve is greater than or equal to the threshold, the adjuster case reserve becomes the financial case reserve booked to the general ledger. The logic here is that the predictive modeling approach is fairly accurate for lower dollar claims. For more severe claims, the adjuster has received more specific information pertinent to the claim and will predict better than the model for higher dollar claims. This combination of adjuster and tabular reserves provides more consistency and accuracy on a monthly basis. The threshold varies by several variables, including product, line coverage and limit, just to name a few. Since the adjuster case reserve is $5,000 and below the threshold, the tabular case reserve of $12,125 is used in the general ledger. In addition, $1,000 of IBNR is set to cover claims that happened in December and at some point after December, would either be late reported or reopened. The IBNR reserve is not attached to any one claim and instead, set as a factor related to earned premium to cover all potential late reported or reopened claims.  The total reserve liability on the balance sheet is $12,125 per case, plus $1,000 for IBNR, equaling a total of $13,125 denoted as the dark blue dot and will be the reserve booked at the end of December. In January, the adjuster has kept their initial estimate of $5,000. Since this is below the $25,000 threshold, the tabular case reserve will again be booked to the general ledger. As part of our roll-forward process, all tabular case reserves can be adjusted monthly by an aging factor and inflation factor. As the claim is 1 month older, the actuarial algorithm predicted that all claims remaining open would have a higher ultimate cost.  In addition, all tabular case reserves that are not part of an in-depth actuarial review during the month gets inflated as well. The new tabular case reserve is 12,376, which is an increase of $251. A portion of this $251 increase is aging and a portion is inflation. This will show up in the earnings release as unfavorable prior accident year all other reserve development in January. It is important to note that other claims that settled in January may have settled for more or less than the December tabular case reserve, which would also show up in the all other development category of the earnings release. In February, the adjuster has received new information and increased their estimate to $15,000. This amount is still below the threshold and thus, the tabular case reserve is still used to set the case reserve liability. In February, this claim was part of the 25% to 30% of reserves reviewed at an in-depth level by the actuarial team. The actuarial team increased the tabular case reserve for all claims that have a similar criteria as this claim to $13,500, which is an increase of $1,124 from January.  This increase will show up as unfavorable prior accident year actuarial adjustments in the earnings release. In March, the adjuster increased their estimate again this time to $20,000. Since $20,000 is still below the threshold of $25,000, the tabular case reserve is still used as the case reserve book to the general ledger. The claim becomes plaintiff attorney rep in March, Thus, while the tabular case reserve will be inflated and aged again, it will also change due to becoming plaintiff attorney rep as this is one of the variables used in the actuarial algorithm.  The tabular case reserve is now $20,050 which is $6,550 greater than the prior month. A portion of this $6,550 increase is due to inflation, a portion due to aging and a portion due to the claim becoming plaintiff attorney rep. The $6,550 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release. In April, the adjuster has increased the reserve again to equal to the reserve threshold, the adjustor's estimate is booked to the general ledger as the case reserve for this claim. This is an increase of $4,950 in the case reserve on the balance sheet, moving from the tabular reserve at the end of March to the adjusted reserve at the end of April. The 4,950 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release.  The adjuster made no change to their estimate in May. Case reserves set equal to or over the threshold can only be changed by the adjuster revising their estimates. Thus, there are no additional changes for inflation, aging or any other factors used in the actuarial algorithm. In June, the claim closed out and settled for $20,000. This will show as $5,000 favorable in the prior accident year, all other development section of the monthly earnings release. Finally, in July, the claim was reopened an additional payment occurred for $1,500. A claim could be reopened for several reasons. For example, a claimant may have initially been undecided about a vehicle repair and received a cash settlement based upon the initial estimate. Several months later, they may have ultimately decided to repair the vehicle, and additional damage may have been found. Another example is when a claimant may initially feel that they are not injured in an accident, the claim is closed and subsequently reopened when the person realizes that they were injured in the accident. While the case reserve had closed out in June, we were still carrying $1,000 of IBNR reserves for the potential of a December claim being late reported or reopening. For this example, the IBNR reserve was released in July, which means that there is an expectation that there will be no future costs from late reports or reopens from any accident that occurred in 2022 and is currently not an open case reserve as of the end of July.  The development is unfavorable $500. This would show up in the prior accident year all other category of the earnings release. In practice, the IBNR reserve for prior accident years tends to get released monthly as part of another actuarial algorithm as the probability of late reports and reopens decreases with time. An in-depth review of IBNR reserves are completed in tandem with case reserves. Remember, any changes made to factors by the actuarial team as a result of those reviews will show up under the prior accident year actuarial category. For the year, the starting reserve was $13,125 and the claim was eventually paid for $21,500. The year-to-date development is unfavorable by this difference, which is $8,375. I as the Chief Actuary, have complete decision-making authority on our reserves. And while the actuarial team has complete independence in determining the reserves to be booked, there are many checks and balances in place. Internally, we have a close partnership with our claims, pricing and product management business partners. Meetings are held throughout the month at both a localized and national level discussing trends, changes in the mix of business, claims process changes, rate activity and methodologies.  Quarterly, I meet with the Audit Committee members of the Board of Directors to discuss results and trends for the quarter. Furthermore, our external auditors perform an annual audit of the company as required by the SEC. My actuarial team meets with the audit firm to discuss our actuarial process, current trends and results for the respective quarters and year.  I hope that you have found this presentation helpful. For more information on Progressive's loss reserving practices, we posted a report under the investor site of progressive.com. This report is updated every 2 years. Thank you for your time today. And I will next turn it over to Jim to discuss cohort pricing.\nJim Curtis: Thanks, Gary. Now let's transition from estimating ultimate losses in LAE to another key element of our pricing, which is our expected lifetime value. We price each policy written to a lifetime target consistent with our enterprise goal of a 96 combined ratio. We refer to this as cohort pricing where a cohort is defined by policies written at new business and followed through their expected lifetime value, including all renewal terms. Lifetime performance is measured as the sum of all expenses realized and the premium earned across all new and renewal terms for a policy. When I say all expenses, by that, I mean loss, LAE, acquisition expenses and operational expenses. As you can see by the stylized chart, loss and expense costs vary between new and renewal policy terms. With this in mind, we price across the policy life to achieve a lifetime 96 combined ratio. Said another way, the sum of lifetime loss and expenses divided by lifetime earned premium, nets us at 96 combined. This pricing approach positions us to offer a competitive rate of new business and stable rates across renewals.  Now that we have a conceptual view of cohort pricing, let's dig into the mechanics. The following is a tabular representation of the lifetime view we covered in the last graph. We think about pricing in 3 separate categories: loss in LAE, acquisition expense and operational expense. Loss and LAE represent our indemnity experience. We break out our expense ratio into acquisition and operational expenses. And in all cases, renewal business operates at a total lower cost structure than the first term or our new business. While we price to the lifetime profitability of our policies at a 96 or better, we also manage this approach with consideration to our calendar year goal of meeting a 96 or better-combined ratio. Next will explore each individual category or line item and finish with our management of cohort pricing within our calendar year 96 goal. Let's start with loss and LAE expense. Loss ratio improves from new business to renewal and is primarily a function of mix of business and policy life expectancy. And we priced to that expected lifetime loss ratio performance based on the characteristics at new business, which ensures the business written is priced to a lifetime target.  Starting in the upper left in this illustrative example, you can see that our first-term business runs at a loss and LAE ratio of 85% with our renewal book of business at 77%. With an expected policy life of 6 policy terms, the lifetime loss and LAE ratio is at 78%. When combined with our other expense categories, the lifetime CR is at 96%, thereby combining new and renewal performance and achieving our lifetime target. However, within the new-to-renewal loss ratio performance, there are segmentation opportunities as not all policy characteristics at new business have the same expected lifetime loss ratio performance. Building on this with an illustrative example, consider car color starting in the upper right. When looking at the expected renewal improvement from new business in loss ratio on red cars, we see a larger change than we expect to see in green cars.  The implication for pricing are twofold. First, we observed that red cars last on average 5 policy terms and green cars last on average 7 policy terms. The second consideration is that the loss behavior also varies. We priced at this differential in expected policy life expectancy and the different improvement in indemnity performance between the 2 segments, in this illustrative case car color. Applying this to a real-life opportunity, we frequently discuss key consumer segments as Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons and our continued opportunity for growth in the Robinsons segment. As a refresher, Robinsons, our consumers who bundle their home and auto needs and typically have a longer policy life expectancy. We can recognize this policy extension and build it into our pricing, which ultimately leads to lower rates with more lifetime renewal premium at a lower cost structure. Finally, while I focused on the indemnity piece of cohort pricing, you'll also note that the policy life expectancy can affect the other expense categories.  We'll move into the distribution channel and acquisition costs next. Before we dig deeper into acquisition expenses, we need to first review the fundamental differences between the direct channel and the independent agency channel. While we price both channels to a lifetime 96, the economics differ in both how we account for the acquisition cost and relatedly, the timing of those costs. Starting on the left, Direct has an upfront acquisition expense by virtue of our marketing spend. We spend consumer marketing dollars, media and nonmedia alike and account for the entire acquisition expense in the new business term. We can see that in the illustrative example with a 60% acquisition expense ratio on the first term and 0% on subsequent renewal terms.  Again, this reinforces the lifetime value of extending policy life expectancy. With the independent agency channel, policies are acquired at the cost of commission paid to the agent. The commission expense is paid to the agent and ultimately reflects a percentage of premium earned by policy term. Unlike Direct, we see a much smaller acquisition expense in the first term, which reflects the commission paid on that term, and we see additional expense in renewal policies also reflecting a percentage of premium earned. In both cases, in this dialyzed example, lifetime acquisition expense is 10%, and we achieved a 96% combined ratio, but we have a much larger first-term expense in Direct and a higher renewal expense in Agency. Let's look at each distribution channel in a little more detail. We'll start by spending more time on how policy life expectancy is a key component to our direct acquisition economics. Consider 2 policies with different PLEs. In policy #1, we see a total of 6 policy terms with a target acquisition expense of 60% on that first term. With an average policy premium of about $750, we can assume our rate level considers about a $450 acquisition expense, which is about 10% across the entire life of the policy. In other words, 750 x 6 policy terms is 4,500 and the $450 policy acquisition expense is 10% over that lifetime premium.  Now let's move to policy #2. Holding all else constant, but the policy life expectancy, you can see the first term assumptions produces the same 450 permissible or 60% of 750. However, with the addition of 2 policy terms, the acquisition expense of $450 million is now 8% of total policy lifetime premium. Said another way, we invested the same $450 in policy acquisition as we did in policy #1, but we see the benefit the PLE extension gives us as a lower acquisition expense as a percentage of lifetime premium. We can segment our pricing to capture differences in policy life expectancy. Depending on market conditions, we can either increase the allowable to drive additional demand or we can lower our rate level to increase our new business conversion. In both cases, we will still achieve a lifetime 96. A real-life example would be our continued segmentation efforts, reflecting our consumer marketing segments and correspondingly, our investment to acquire Robinsons. Again, those who bundle home and auto, which carry a longer policy life expectancy compared to those who don't bundle their home and auto with Progressive.  Moving on to the Agency channel. This distribution business model takes a different form, as I mentioned, we pay commission to agents. In the example above, the policy achieves a lifetime 96, but you can see that the acquisition expense ratio is the same between the first policy term and the remaining 5 renewal terms. This is possible because we pay commission by policy term and ultimately unearned premium. In practice, it is possible to vary commission by new and renewal. However, even in this scenario, the combined ratio implications will likely be much flatter than what we see in our direct economics. Because we pay a percent of commission is earned, acquisition costs and dollars will vary based on policy premium, but as a percentage of premium, we'll always match.  This is a key element in cohort pricing as the dollars may vary, but the expense as a percentage of the premium will be the same. We still see cohort performance that has an overall higher cost structure in new business, but it is proportionately more in an indemnity and operational expense relative to our direct business model. Finally, we finished with operational expenses, and we see a modest new renewal differential. The operational cost for servicing new business policies is greater than the operational cost for renewal terms. The remaining other category includes things like bad debt or unpaid balances on earned premiums. We extend coverage on a canceled policy and did not receive payment. This happens with greater frequency on new business. We see these expense differentials consistently and can also price them into our product. Calendar year earnings have an implicit new and renewal mix driving results, and we manage that mix to ensure target combined ratios are achieved for the calendar year-end question.  While managing our new renewal mix, we consider both the mix of our cohorts and the rate revisions earning in. Remember that rate from revisions take time to earn in as policies have to renew into the new rate level. Typically, this happens in our new business faster than renewal as our rates hit the marketplace before our renewal book. This will affect the combined ratio performance of our new business and renewal cohorts. Setting rate changes aside, periods of accelerated new business application growth can apply upward pressure on our combined ratio, as we now know, new business has a higher expected combined ratio and in the case of Direct has additional pressure based on our accounting of consumer marketing expense. Using this stylized example, you can see that in a period of high growth, new business makes up a larger portion of our total earned premium. And while we may be within our lifetime targets, we see our calendar combined ratio pierce the 96. To manage this, we can slow growth and thereby reduce the mix of new business earned premiums, which results in a combined ratio less than our 96 goals. And in both cases, we are within our cohort targets.  This is a great example of how we develop our media budget. We consider both our lifetime economics and our margin position considering each simultaneously with calendar year performance taking priority, and we then adjust our budget accordingly. Upward pressure from new business can be dampened by the lengthening of policy life expectancy as our renewal book becomes a larger portion of the overall book of business. With the expected combined ratio improvement, we can use that to manage new and renewal earned premium mix. As you can see, as it relates to our expected cohort performance, we price across the lifetime of a policy and balance our near-term and long-term growth with our 96 calendar year goal. Thank you for your time.\nA - Douglas Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Gary Traicoff and Jim Curtis, who can answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question.\nOperator: The first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, you guys highlighted that you need 6 points of additional price, right, in Personal Auto over the balance of the year. Can you just help us get a sense, what are you assuming for severity and even frequency, just overall from a loss trend perspective when you think about additional rate need from here?\nSusan Griffith: Thanks, Elyse. We really don't share our trend selects normally. But obviously, we've been seeing the trends in shorter-tail business increase as just the repairs to vehicles have slowed down. And when we look at that in overall kind of both frequency and severity, we think we're at 6 right now. And just like I said in the last call that could range. But at this juncture, we think we need another 6, so about 17-ish for the full year.\nElyse Greenspan: And that will get you -- you believe that will get you to the 96?\nSusan Griffith: It will certainly get close. Again, all the caveats I said last time with weather. We feel much better about our reserving because of those losses being short-tailed, and we started seeing those at the end of last year. So I believe Gary really got out in front of that. It will certainly get us closer. But again, all the caveats and the uncertainty that we've felt for the last 3 years kind of are underlying that assumption.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my follow-up, you guys saw a significant amount of adverse development for accident year 2022. So I'm just trying to square the fact that there was a good amount of adverse development for accident year '22 with the improvement that you're seeing in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio so far this year.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. What I would say to that is as those 2022 rates earned in that I put on one of the slides that I had, we believe we're putting on the books both new and renewal business that is closer to or below our targets, our accident year targets, I should say, in both channels on a year-to-date basis. So we feel good about where we're at in the business we're putting on the book in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: I guess my first question is on loss cost expenses. And you talked about, Tricia, coming from a variety of sources. And you also talked in the letter about some of those sources looking like they're maybe mean reverting or decelerating a bit. But I guess just stepping back, I know there's -- I know this is a complicated issue because there's lots of different sources. But we saw, I feel like over the last decade or so, a bit of a secular trend in terms of higher bodily injury expense inflation levels. And maybe you disagree with that. But -- and the industry seems like they've been doing a decent job of appreciating that over time in pricing for it. It seems like it's coming more -- or we can see the data is coming more from the non-BI side today. And so do you feel like there's like a stickiness to this that you and the industry are appreciating? And ultimately, does this kind of cause Progressive to not be able to maybe play as much often if there's uncertainty on the trend over the coming year or so?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think we have our arms around it. I mean for BI, obviously, we try to keep ahead of that trend. When we see it, we react to it, and we're in line with the industry. This has been a very unusual time. As you know, if you've looked over the last couple of years, and you've seen the Manheim used car index and how that's flowed. Even though you're seeing it tick down a little bit, it still is a very big difference in what you saw in 2018 and 2019. So when we look at that, especially as we looked at the second half of last year, we really started to see the trend, specifically in property damage, but also in collision increase. And it's really -- and we're watching it flow through in our claims organization.  So you have -- let's take the property damage example. Somebody is taking care -- another one of our carriers -- competitors taking care of their insured, but they're going to subrogate us. So that accident happens today. And there's no shop capacity for that particular hit. So they do an estimate as best they can with the sheet metal still in the car. Let's say it's drivable, for this example. And they continue to drive. The shop can get it in 45 days from now, maybe 60 days from now. It comes in, they get the sheet metal off of it, oh, lo and behold, there's more damage. Those supplements are more frequent, and they're more expensive.  So you're having capacities, longer cycle times, longer rental times. I think I said in my letter, the rental time, we're seeing it go down a little bit, and that's one data point. So we'll continue to watch that. But you've got that, and then you've got labor rates and parts increase. So in terms of your question, the stickiness, will likely be based on wages for workers in the body shop.  So there -- recently a Wall Street Journal article that talked about automotive repair workers, their salaries increased 24% in quarter 4 of 2022 compared to 2018. So 20% over the last year, and that was from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And making cars be in the same position, the indemnification of the vehicles has also soared since 2018, about 36%.  So I do think we might see some trends like in used car prices as the supply chain issues came through and new, et cetera. That might continue to go down. But I think some of the other things will be part of our new normal.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. My final question is on the expense ratio. It's been -- the expense ratio has come down a lot. You've called out. We can see some of the math behind it. It looks like ad expenses has been the biggest lever, which is a great lever to have. But kind of curious directionally is -- we're looking at the ad expense ratio over a decade plus, is this -- are we kind of at the trough? Or is there more room for either ad and/or the expense ratio to come down in the coming quarters?\nSusan Griffith: Well, as we attempt to get to our calendar year 96 where there's always levers we can pull, clearly, I'd rather be in a different position where we're spending more money on media and continuing to grow as long as, of course, that would be at our target profit margins. We have a lot of discipline within the company as well in terms of expenses in times such as these. So we -- obviously, we'll continue to look at that for this next 6 months to see if we can get closer to that 96.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan Securities.\nJimmy Bhullar: So you went through a lot of details on your whole process on reserving. But maybe just stepping back, can you talk about your confidence in where your reserves sit now? And given that you've had, I think, 6 straight months of adverse development, are you much more comfortable in reserves overall? Or is there still a lot of uncertainty, and it's hard to say that you've got up in terms of loss trends?\nSusan Griffith: I'll let Gary weigh in on that. I would say from where I sit, I'm much more comfortable. But again, Gary is independent and does his reserve reviews without my involvement. I hear about that just a little bit before you do. So Gary, why don't you weigh in a little bit.\nGary Traicoff: Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Great question, Jimmy. So overall, yes, I feel really good about our overall reserve position and where we're at right now. To your point, we have had quite a bit of unfavorable development each of the last 6 months. As Tricia pointed out, if you exclude Florida, all of the development would really be coming from accident year 2022 were actually favorable on accident year '21 and prior.  And within accident year '22, over 85% is from accidents that happened in the last 6 months of the year. And a lot of that relates to the fixing cars and the reopen severity that Tricia was talking about. That's fairly short-tailed. We've seen that come through the data, and we have reacted very quickly to it.  And so that gives me a lot of confidence because of the short tail nature of -- or most of the issue was that we're in a good position right now. At the same time, right, I can't obviously guarantee and the data could change going forward, but I feel really good of our current position.\nSusan Griffith: Thanks, Gary.\nJimmy Bhullar: And along the same lines on Florida, I think it was somewhat expected that the number of lawsuits would go up given total form, but it's lasted longer in your results. So just wondering how the number of lawsuits that are coming in have trended through the last 3, 4 months or so? And was there an element of Florida in June in terms of adverse development and how that's changed versus maybe April and May?\nGary Traicoff: Yes. So that's a good question. So with respect to Florida overall, obviously, the big hit occurred March, April, May. And we've started to see it level out in what's been coming through. Most of June really related to the actuarial adjustments that we took from the reserve reviews primarily related to property damage, third-party fixing cars. So Florida had a very little impact from what we had from the June development.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. And all I would say in addition to that is as soon as the House Bill 837 went through, and then we had the subsequent lawsuits that I talked about, we went in and were pretty aggressive and conservative because we were trying to figure out what was estimable and probable. And that will develop over time as those also get settled. So that's not something that we'll know right away because those take a little bit longer to settle.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: I just had a follow-up on the reserves. Gary, you had mentioned that you can adjust up to 100% of your reserve balance monthly. I'm just wondering if that happened in June. Or was it a normal review where you maybe did 60 to 70 reviews, but not a complete review? And we have to wait for potential further movement upwards or downwards as we move forward over the next few months?\nGary Traicoff: Yes. Good question. So in June, it was the typical 25% to 30% of reserves that were looked at. The comment related to the 100% kind of goes to the part on the reviews that we do not look at in the month. They still will be inflated or unless -- particularly if they're below the threshold, they will be inflated. And they also will be aged.  They also can change. For example, they become plaintiff attorney rep, et cetera. So the potential every month to have 100% of the reserves adjusted somewhat whether it's by an adjuster or whether it's by inflation or aging exists. In terms of our normal process, we typically stay pretty consistent with that 25% to 30%. I would say the only couple of times we might deviate, in December, in particular, because I'm the opining actuary for the statutory reserves. If we are seeing additional information, we may add a review or 2 to make sure that the statutory companies are in the correct position as of year-end. And then, obviously, for something like Florida when the House Bill passes, we would go in immediately with new information from that and do an adjustment.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. So I guess -- so in the June review, it sounds -- so I guess you just confirmed that was just 25% to 30% and maybe some other adjustments around the edges, but it wasn't one of those full comprehensive reviews.\nGary Traicoff: Yes, that's correct.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. And then just my second question, so I believe there was a stylized example just given about the mix of business and how having less new business, more renewal business can have an impact. I guess how quickly can that have an impact on the combined ratio, particularly considering the growth that you guys had in the first quarter? Is that something where that mix can change significantly through the end of this year?\nSusan Griffith: I'll let Jim talk about that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot more that goes into it than just the acquisition expense. A lot has to do with losses, and there could be uncertainty around catastrophes, et cetera. But Jim, do you want to talk a little bit about that?\nJim Curtis: Sure. Also a good question. A couple of ways to think about that. There's several dimensions to consider when thinking about mix. So to your point about any type of lag function when we write business, it's in written premium, but doesn't necessarily hit our earned premium mix until it starts to age or get into the policy term.  So we would see on a 6-month basis, roughly 3 to 4 months later, where you start to see your earned premium mix shift. That would work in both ways, periods of growth on new business apps and periods of slowing our new business apps.\nUnidentified Company Representative: The one thing I would add to that, just for clarification, we expensed advertising in the period incurred. So all -- on a direct basis, especially -- and you're seeing that come through the expense ratio very quickly.\nJim Curtis: Yes, I would -- and I would build on that, that the expense does hit immediately. The earned premium mix would -- really would start to see some measure of reaction in our indemnity performance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nTaylor Scott: First one I had is on the commentary that you guys gave on the lifetime combined ratios. And it just strikes me is a lot of that is very geared towards what the lifetime ends up being. And appreciate that you guys probably have the best data and best capability to analyze it, too. But are we at a period of time where just given how unprecedented it is, with inflation and all the pricing, I mean how much room is there around the estimates that you guys are putting into the lifetime?  I mean, are you being conservative around potentially significantly higher churn as we kind of get through this period where everything is being taken out to market on a much more consistent basis? And how much is that being incorporated into your decision as to whether to start growing quickly or not?\nSusan Griffith: Well, I think we always -- each data point. And as we get more confidence, of course, we were able to do that. We saw an increase in PLE on both the 12 months and 3 months. I'd like to see a couple more data points because there's a lot of shopping in the industry. And obviously, you're looking at the same data we are from the industry, and there's a lot from movement from rates. So I would say there's hundreds of variables that we look at when we think about that. And we'll continue to do so, again, in this uncertain environment. Jim, do you want to add anything?\nJim Curtis: Sure. We also consider different time periods and just typical when looking at data set, longer time period, more credibility and more confidence we have. We'll look at recent time period as just a leading indicator adjust slowly. My team set sort of our permissible acquisition as an example, and we just go through that exact process.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I would just quickly add is that we're not writing a 4-year policy at once, right? We constantly adjust rates to ensure we're hitting our lifetime targets. So to the extent that we have those targets, every renewal of every policy, and we have an advantage with a mix of 6 months policies that we can adjust as we see another card or see another data point in loss costs, et cetera.\nSusan Griffith: Have you seen that with how nimble we've been with our pricing over the year? As we've seen things we've made changes. We are as anxious as likely our shareholders to grow. But again, we have a very specific core value of profit on a calendar year 96. And so that's a priority.\nTaylor Scott: Got it. That's helpful. The follow-up I had is on the loss adjustment side of things. I mean some of the anecdotal chatter, I've heard out there is that just given where the labor markets are and so forth that the claims adjusting process might be challenged by that and being able to get the right amount of hires and talent and to be able to execute that process like it's done normally. And are you -- have you experienced any of that? Is that at all a challenge that you face in trying to get the reserves in the right spot consistently? Or is that something that's less of an issue at this point?\nSusan Griffith: I think it's a little bit less of an issue. I think anytime you have the growth we've had and with the labor environment that has been around for a couple of years, it's a challenge. I will say at this juncture, we are fully staffed in our claims organization. So we feel really great about that and turnover is continuing to go down.  That said, our tenure is still low. And so with that comes just the learning curve from that. And our Claims President is having the newer people definitely are in the office with supervisors because that's really where you learn a lot and you get up to speed very quickly, and we have a lot of processes in order to do that.  But I would say, if you asked me that a year ago, it would be a different answer than today. I feel confident in our claims organization, the action they're taking. And as tenure continues to grow, I think we'll be in a great position for accuracy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes. I guess my question is for Jim. Looking at the new cohort acquisition cost ratio, can you talk a little bit about how the current period with ambient shopping in the last meeting to reach new customers with advertising to get them onboarding affects the way you look at that new cohort margin?\nJim Curtis: Sure. We measure that by our permissible compared to actual. Actual is defined as our media spend or consumer marketing spend and income and volume apps, with what we believe to be as a sort of heightened dislocation in the marketplace, a lot of shopping, which we hold our conversion level that will drive our cost per sale down. And so in the current period, we'd be pretty efficient. And then it's a matter of managing our media budget to our calendar year position.\nJoshua Shanker: And I realize how valuable the 96 calendar year is to the company. Is there a risk that right now, there's an opportunity to acquire new customers at a cost far below the long-term average and by focusing on the 96, there's a lot of growth being forgone that ultimately will be more expensive to achieve in the future?\nSusan Griffith: Josh, that's a great question, one we obviously ask ourselves. And in fact, I was recently onboarding a new director on our Board. And I let her know that are, in my mind, as I lead the organization, there are 2 things that are sacrosanct here: our 5 core values at our 96 calendar year combined ratio.  So I'm going to -- this is going to be a longer answer, but I think it's one that a lot of the -- a lot of your analysts -- the analysts have asked Doug. And so I think it's worth the time for -- just me to walk through a little bit how we think about this on the profit side, the growth side and the capital side.  So let me first begin by reiterating our core values and, of course, one is profit -- public in 1971. And ever since that date, it's been publicly talked about, probably prior to that, I just don't have the evidence in writing. But like all our other core values, profits, it's not a value of convenience, where we look to waver from it depending on the business. It's really how we guide our business. It's an all-in number. We don't manage to an underlying even though that's obviously something we look at, but it can't be exclusive of catastrophes or adverse development or reserve development of any kind because that's part of being the business of insurance. How it reads -- it's our profit core value states. We have a responsibility to ourselves, our customers, agents and investors to be a profitable and enduring company by offering products and services consumers value. It's part of what makes and has made Progressive so successful. We inject the discipline of putting profits before growth, and we've built a business that has delivered better than industry results consistently for a very long time. That consistency in which we've been able to deliver on our profit target is a significant part of the share price multiples we enjoy today. Like now when profits are under pressure, we take action quickly and aggressively. And by taking action quickly and aggressively, we not only meet our targets, we've also put business that reaches or exceeds our goals and deflect business that doesn't. You might remember, because you've been around for a while, over 7 years ago when I took over this role, I took the opportunity to publicly commit to some objectives that we've written about for years. And I just want to take a moment to reiterate one of those. It's outlined in our annual report in our policy section, but I think it's worth repeating.  For us, a 96 combined ratio is not a solve for variable in our business model equation, but rather a constant that provides direction to each product and marketing decision and a cultural shipping point that ensures 0 ambiguity as to how to act in certain situations. Set at a level we believe create a fair balance between attractive profitability and consumer competitiveness, it's deeply ingrained and central to our culture.  I can't really stress that enough. It's part of the fabric of our culture and really embedded in everything we do along with the other 4 core values. It's true our published accident year ratios are lower than the calendar year ratios and closer to our targets. However, that's the moment in time. And I really have said several times in prior calls that uncertainty is a new normal since the onset of the pandemic, and that remains true today.  So for us, growing fast in an uncertain future, before profit is addressed it's a recipe for sustained profit pain. Many insurance companies make this misstep, and we don't intend to repeat those mistakes. But let me go to growth because I think that's the story that we're not hearing enough as well.  I wanted to remind everyone of the significant growth we've had in the first half of 2023. In 6 months, we've added 2.2 million policies in force. And we've increased written premiums by over $5 billion, and that's the equivalent of adding a top 10 Personal Auto carrier. So I would say growth this year could be defined as spectacular.  Ambient shopping, and you brought that up, does remain elevated. Our agency channel is actually the best barometer for industry shopping levels because it's less affected by media expenditures. And that channel quotes were up about 16% in the quarter. If we had perfect knowledge about the future and knew that we, for sure, had adequate rates, undoubtedly, there's opportunity for significant growth today.  But that said, growth opportunities today do not preclude the possibility of growth opportunities tomorrow. You've probably watched in the past, and we've taken rates and other underwriting actions to focus on achieving our profitability goal. We've proven to be better positioned for strong growth in the following periods: 2022 was among the worst years for industry Personal Auto profitability and so far, 2023 has been worse.  While we can't know the future, current market conditions suggest there'll be opportunity to increase market share in the future. And then just let me wrap up by saying growth can't happen without growing surplus. Our capital position today is strong, and we believe we have plenty of capital to support the premium growth we expect.  We have a structured growth business that is largely self-funding internally through underwriting profits and investment returns. So to bring us back full circle, our profit core value is the key to sustained growth. I know that was a long answer, but I think it's really important to be super clear and unambiguous about how we think about the business. I hope that answered your question, and hopefully, others.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I'm going to start building upon the comments you just had about the growth results and Jim's cohort pricing. I'm wondering if you can provide us a perspective of how the limits profile of your consolidated order book have changed. I would imagine if you're focused more on Robinsons, the profile is moving up. But maybe you could give us an updated perspective on how that looks and where you think it might be heading.\nSusan Griffith: Yes, I think you're spot on. We are trying to have more and more of the Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We love Sams as long as we can make our target profit margin, but we continue to increase our bundle. And as we think about both auto and property, those bundles are more important. So we've increased our Robinsons over time. And then, of course, we've talked about this in the past, and it's probably worth an update at some point in the next couple of quarters.  The soon-to-be Robinsons. So it could be a Diane that's buying a house, et cetera. So we'll continue to try to be a place for every cohort, but we have increased our Robinsons profile in the last several years. And of course, during times like this, Sams are going to shop more because they're very incented by price.\nCharles Peters: Right. I guess -- well, I guess what I'm wondering is, in the cohort pricing, there's an assumption around retention. And given that there's all these price changes happening, not only at Progressive, but with a lot of other companies in the auto sector, I'm wondering how with elevated shopping, how those retention characteristics are holding out at the Robinson level, at the right level? Is it matching what your expectations are? Or is that causing some hiccups along your pricing assumptions?\nSusan Griffith: Well, I think -- we don't talk about retention with each of the profiles of our consumers, the marketing tiers. But we do look over time. And historically, Robinsons have fared better. And we find that the more products you have, the stickier you're going to be. And Sams, especially if there's other characteristics to go, can -- last about the same months and haven't varied too much over the years. But although we don't share it, I would say Robinsons continue to be stickier.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Great. I just -- we are constantly looking at the assumption to go into our acquisition model. As Jim was mentioning, we use PLE to understand the permissible costs for acquiring customers, and we do that at a very granular level. So you're right. There have been significant changes in policy life expectancy. Obviously, lately, it has been going back up, and we're looking at that at a very granular level and pricing that in over the lifetime of those customers. And to pass point, we have many shots at pricing -- repricing those customers, if necessary.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tracy Bunguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Just a quick follow-up on your 96% combined ratio target. I appreciate all the commentary so far. But I'm just wondering, do you feel like there are secular changes going on in auto that you may need to do better than 96%? Like it feels like the tail is lengthening, which is happening for property damage despite it being a short tail line, which could add to volatility.\nSusan Griffith: Well, good question, Tracy. You remember our 96 is an aggregate. So we look at it differently for new business, renewal business. We've taken to the assumptions of our PLE products, state, although it all goes up to 96, which I don't think will change. One, thing, we do look at a really granular level; and two, I think we want to watch this playthrough because some of these changes came about pretty quickly in the delays. And a lot of it is really the shop capacity. And as that starts to open up with the exception of what I talked about with labor rates and probably prices, I think we could be priced adequately and continue to keep our 96 calendar year and lifetime goal. That would be my approach.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Your year-to-date current accident year actuarial adjustments of $424 million was primarily driven by fixing vehicle coverages. So how do I reconcile that update with your property damage severity loss trend going down when you come up with your loss picks? Like you reported yesterday, property damage severity is 11%. But if I compare that to 1Q, it was 15% and then 20% in the full year '22.\nSusan Griffith: Well, we had a lot of rate increases come in, so that was one of them. And a lot of our property, if you take -- if you look at the property and the cat load on top of it or the -- I should say, the cats we've had, you can take that into account. But it is -- that 80% of that, I think you did the quarterly number, but 80% of that $1.1 billion on the year-to-date was auto, 50% was cars, about 35-ish percent was Florida, glass, PIP, BI. And then the rest was IBNR and BI across the country, but property did not -- did develop favorably. Gary, do you want to add anything?\nGary Traicoff: So I think Tricia's spot on there. The one thing I would add, Tracy, to your point, the property damage severity that you're showing, that's for all claims, if we stratified and only looked at the reopen severity, which is really where the reserve actual adjustments have come from. The reopen severity is well above and has been increasing over those quarters relative to the 13%, 14% you're seeing.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Yes. Sorry, I meant in your current loss pick, your current -- your actuarial adjustment, not the $22 million adjustments. Are you considering a higher loss pick for property damage or not given that -- it feels like that loss trend is trending down?\nGary Traicoff: Yes. We are. So I think to your point, even though the overall is trending down some, the reopen severity, we believe, on the current accident year has been trending up. And so a lot of those actuarial adjustments, both on prior and current year are reflecting the elevated reopen severity. Even though, to your point, the overall has come down, that is a different trend if you just look at only the reopen severity, which is really what's driving a lot of the reserves.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: So Tricia, I guess just going back to the comments you were making about how in the past, you've had tons of remediation that have led to tons of outsized growth. And you referenced that you see opportunity for that in the future. Just curious from where you sit today, is there any reason to think your appetite will grow, will be different going into 2024 than it was going into 2023?\nSusan Griffith: As long as we look at the data and feel good about where we're at with our combined ratio on overall calendar year and accident year, we will grow as fast as we can. So that has been our objective for a long time, 96, grow as fast as we can. We want to do that. We're a growth company. We feel great about it. But again, profits over growth. But as soon as we feel confident with the little stability and less uncertainty, we are very prepared to grow.\nRyan Tunis: And just to be clear, like let's just say they're about -- you guys executed, but there's a bad hurricane and you ended up coming in at That wouldn't lead you to punish yourselves and not grow in January, right? You'd be looking what you think the prospective returns are.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. Yes. We don't know how the next 6 months will go. We're going to do the best we can. But again, like you said, if something happens, that is above and beyond that would be different. But yes, we will continue to grow. And in 2024 would be a new year as long as we felt that we had the policies on the book that we believe are at or below our new and renewal targets.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just lastly, we've talked about the impact of the [indiscernible] stuff on prior year. Is there any way to quantify the loss ratio impact did that happen in the first half of 2023 -- on the current accident year?\nSusan Griffith: From Florida, you mean?\nRyan Tunis: Correct.\nUnidentified Company Representative: The current accident year, the impact was virtually 0 because those are lawsuits that are opening on claims that occurred pre-HB837. It can't be now because HB837 was in March. So there's some, but predominantly, those were prior year claims. We're also looking closely at what we expect to be some benefit in the environment from HB837 as well. We're looking at the data closely. It will take a while to assess if indeed, we are seeing that. But we personally -- we believe that there is going to be a benefit, and we look forward to pricing in once we see it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: A lot of questions on the 96, so I'll pile on here. So if I understand correctly, you're still within line of sight, being close to 96 for this calendar year. One of the ways you can achieve that is by lowering new business growth, which ultimately should improve the combined ratio. I guess my question is, and maybe it's the other side of Josh's question earlier, ultimately, can you achieve that simply by lowering the new business growth while achieving kind of a 96 combined ratio for cohorts?  Or do you now need -- or are you aiming to achieve a better than 96 for existing cohorts in order to get to the 96 will be as close to the 96 for the year.\nSusan Griffith: Well, we clearly need to get a rate. So that's one part of the formula. We also have really had a lot of restrictions from an underwriting perspective. on new business. And so those are some other things that go into it. We have a line of sight, but again, we'll caveat that by all the comments regarding uncertainty that I've said before.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. But ultimately, do you believe that beyond the kind of flexing down or up the new business growth, do you need to take any additional actions to lower the combined ratio for the existing business below 96 in order to get to a full year 96 or close to it?\nUnidentified Company Representative: So clearly, the new renewal mix is working in our favor right now. The other bigger tailwind is the rate that's earning in. So we've taken a lot of rates. We still have about 6 points in Personal Auto for that rate to earn in. Additionally, we're taking 6 more points for the rest of the year. So the denominator effect is a tailwind for us the rest of the year.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then my other question, maybe for Gary, since Gary is on the call. We saw an uptick in bodily injury severity this quarter. And I am curious as to how that ultimately plays out or how you think about it, how you approach that with regards to prior year reserves? Ultimately, I would think that bodily injury has a longer tail, so more risk there for things going adversely. So how do you approach that?\nSusan Griffith: I'll start, and then Gary can weigh in. About half of the BI was actuarial reserves, but it's pretty much in line with the industry. So we're not too concerned about it. A lot of them are soft tissue, attorney rep but not litigated. So they do take longer. But I feel like we're in a good position and understand where they're headed. And I think in a better position than we were even a year ago. Gary, do you want to add anything?\nGary Traicoff: Yes. I think Tricia is spot on there. The only couple of things I'd add from the reserve side is we tend to look at the data off of an accident period basis, right, as opposed to reported calendar information. The accident period data is more smooth, right, on a calendar basis, you can get some movements up or down, sometimes with changes in mix or closures, et cetera.  So on an accident period basis, we're a little bit lower than what that shows. The other thing what Tricia alluded to is there's some large loss mix, et cetera. If you think back to that presentation, that's one of the reasons we employ that reserve threshold. So when our claims adjusters identify those large losses, once it's above that threshold, they put that up immediately. So it's recognized in the reserves. And again, there could be a little bit a timing difference between the accident period and the calendar period, which you would see.\nDouglas Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time, and so that concludes our event. Michelle, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's Second Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of this event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Traicoff",
            "content": "Thank you, Tricia, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to talk to you today about loss reserving at Progressive. I will first cover some key definitions and metrics in our general process, then walk through an example on how our overall reserve levels are determined. And finally, walk through an example of the reserving life cycle of an individual claim and how it would flow through the actuarial categories of the earnings release. Let's start off with the size of our loss and loss adjustment expense or LAE reserves. The columns represent our carried reserve balance at the end of each calendar year from 2013 through 2022 and at June 30, 2023, for the rightmost column. On the left side of the graph, we can see that in 2013, Progressive had about $8.5 billion in reserves on a gross of reinsurance basis at year-end 2013. This would be the sum of the orange and blue sections within the bar with our growth as a company, reserves before reinsurance as of June 30, 2023, is now almost $33 billion and almost 4x greater than what it was in 2013, while our premium growth was a little less than 3x greater over the same time period. Much of this difference in reserves outpacing premium growth relates to our growth in longer-tailed products and commercial lines over this period. This means that we believe for all accidents that have occurred through June 30, 2023, our ultimate future liabilities will be almost $33 billion. The orange section of the bars represents how much of our reserves are ceded for reinsurance. Some examples of this include state-regulated plans, such as Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association and the Florida Hurricane Cat Fund and private reinsurers. Our ceded reserves now make up about 16% of our gross reserves versus just over 12% in 2013. Much of this increase in the higher proportion of ceded reserves relates to newer products that have been added over time, including property and protective, which have more reinsurance needs than our historical products. The blue section of the columns represents how much of our reserves are retained after reinsurance, almost $28 billion as of June 30, 2023.  Next, let's look at some metrics on how our reserves are distributed. The chart on the left shows that 67% of our net reserves are in loss case, 17% loss IBNR and the remainder under LAE. Any open claim will be assigned a case reserve that may be set by a claims adjuster or an actuarially derived estimate set by the actuarial team. We will discuss this in more detail in a future slide. IBNR, which stands for incurred but not reported, makes up about 17% of our net reserves. IBNR may have different meanings across companies. For most of Progressive's products, one can think of IBNR as the future liabilities to cover claims that have already happened and are currently not recorded as open case reserves. This would include late reports, reopens and salvage and subrogation recoveries. Anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries can be thought of as a contra reserve and is a reduction to future liabilities. For most of our products, IBNR does not cover any anticipated development in case reserves. This is because since our case reserves are a combination of adjuster estimates and actuarially set case reserves for the majority of our products, our IBNR reserve, does not cover expected case development. LAE reserves make up the remaining 16% and typically cover the anticipated expenses needed to settle claims that have already happened, such as defense counsel costs and claims adjuster salaries. The middle chart shows the distribution of our reserves by product. As expected, reserves will index more to longer-tailed products with higher limits relative to premium size. Thus, our Commercial Lines business makes up almost 1/3 of our total reserves, but a smaller proportion of premium. The graph on the right shows that in personal auto, 83% of our reserves are set to cover injury and medical costs and 17% to cover the cost of fixed vehicles. Again, this is due to the longer-tail nature and higher severity costs to injury and medical coverages versus fixing vehicle coverages and reserves are over-indexed to injury and medical relative to premium. In addition, fixing vehicle coverages have a higher proportion of contra-reserves from salvage and subrogation compared to injury and medical. One additional point. This data is as of year-end 2022 and is on a net of reinsurance basis. While the previous slide gave a high-level overview of the distribution of our reserve mix by various parts, we review the reserves at a much more granular level. We typically review reserves by some combination of product, geographic areas such as group of states, individual states and even down to a region or subset within a state. Further breakouts typically include individual line coverages such as bodily injury, uninsured motor bodily injury and property damage and even by limit. To determine these breakouts, we weigh the credibility of the data, homogeneity in the data and additional value of segmenting the data at a finer level.  For example, in personal auto bodily injury, almost all states are reviewed separately with the majority of states reviewed quarterly. State-level data is credible and many states have different development patterns, which warrant the data to be reviewed separately. In personal auto collision, while state-level data is credible, many states exhibit similar data patterns and several clusters of states are reviewed together. About 25% to 30% of our reserves are reviewed at this in-depth level monthly and about 85% of our reserves quarterly. About 700 reviews, which is some combination of product, state, line, et cetera, are reviewed over the course of the year. By reviewing reserves at this detailed level, we are able to adjust reserves more accurately at a granular level, which helps our pricing teams better match price to risk. We also have a robust roll-forward process that we will discuss later on, which allows up to 100% of the reserves to be adjusted monthly. The roll-forward process allows us the time to do a deep analysis on a portion of the reserves monthly while still feeling comfortable that all of our reserves are being updated monthly. Here is an example of how an in-depth review schedule will look over 3 months. In the first month of the quarter, 57 reserve reviews were completed. Each reserve review is either a loss or LAE review, which is further broken down between defense cost containment or DCC and adjusting and other expenses or A&O. Some combination of products, such as personal auto, CL or one of our core commercial auto products or TNC, which represents transportation network companies, line coverages such as bodily injury and some combination of state is reviewed. These 57 reviews would make up about 25% to 30% of our total reserves. In the following month, 60 reviews were completed. Again, there is some combination of type, product, coverage and state, but all 60 reviews are independent of reviews completed during the first month and represent another 25% to 30% of our total reserves. Finally, the third month of the quarter had 68 reviews completed, which are all different from any reviews completed during the previous 2 months and represent an additional 25% to 30% of the total reserves. Over the course of the quarter, about 85% of the reserves were reviewed. Typically, between 50 to 70 reviews are completed per month. Now let's talk about how the overall reserve level is determined. We use several different methods. One of the methods that we use is called the accident period chain ladder method in a standard industry practice. And the example above, each row represents a 6-month period when the accident occurred and each column represents how much in paid losses had been paid out for those accidents at certain time periods after the accident. For example, the top row represents all accidents that occurred from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The $100 in Column 1 means that the $100 was paid out as of December 31, 2021 for those accidents. Moving to the right of the same row. Column 2 of $120 means that for accidents that occurred during the last 6 months of 2021, as of June 2022, cumulatively that $120 had been paid out. Thus, an additional $20 was paid out during the first half of 2022. The increase of $20 could be due to payments on known claims, late reports or reopen activity. The increase of 20% from $100 to $120 is shown in the loss development factors section in the December 2021 row and column 1.  Similarly, the loss development factor of 1.08 in Column 2 of the December 2021 row is calculated by taking the paid loss of $130 in Column 3, divided by the paid loss of $120 in Column 2 for the December 2021 row. Next, the actuarial analyst selected a 1.27 in the first column as the predicted Column 1 loss development factor for the accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June of 2023. We can see that in the June 2023 row, $120 had been paid out by the end of June 2023. The analyst is predicting that paid losses will increase by 27% or $33 during the second half of 2023 and cumulatively be at $153 by December 2023. Multiplying the $153 by an additional 8% predicts that an additional $12 will get paid out by the third column for a cumulative of $165. Thus, the shaded numbers in blue are predictions of what will be paid out in the future. The indicated reserve is then calculated by taking the ultimate estimated paid losses minus what has already been paid as of June 2023 since reserves are to cover future liabilities. The indicated reserve is $45 for accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June 2023 and $13 for accidents happening during the second half of 2022. In total, the indicated reserve is the sum of all accident periods or rows and adds up to $58. This example illustrates an accident period chain ladder approach using paid data. Triangle, similar to this byproduct and grouped by line coverage can be found in our annual report. Other approaches that we typically employ include using case incurred data, developing severity and frequency separately and stratifying the data by size of loss layer. In addition, data is also segmented by late report and reopen lag time from the date of loss to the date of late report and reopen and hindsight testing to prior reserve amounts are considered as well. Additional ad hoc analysis is typically completed to understand changes in the underlying data and loss development factors. Based on the indications from the multiple reviews completed during the month, the actuarial team will then decide how much of an overall reserve change is needed and adjust reserve factors accordingly. Those changes will show up in the earnings release under the actuarial adjustment section and be reported showing the breakout for the current accident year and all prior accident years. For example, in June of 2023, based off the scheduled reserve reviews, which represented between 25% to 30% of reserves, the actuarial team increased reserves $130.9 million for accident years 2022 and prior and increased reserves $160.3 million for the 2023 accident year for a total change of $291.2 million. The $130.9 million increase to prior accident years directly impacted the prior accident year development. In addition, due to other changes not related to actuarial reviews, prior accident years developed an additional $6.9 million unfavorably for a total amount of unfavorable development of $137.8 million.  Next, we will discuss what are some of the other items that are in all other development. Now let's go through an example of the pathway of a case reserve over time and the impact on our monthly earnings release. Remember, case reserves make up about 67% of our total reserves. In this example, a claim happens on December 15 and is reported and opened in our claims system on December 19. Since the claim was reported in the same month as the occurrence of the accident, this would not be considered an IBNR claim. The adjuster does not have much information about the claim at this point and it sets a case reserve of $5,000, noted by the orange dot. In parallel, a tabular case reserve is determined for this claim from an algorithm used by the actuarial team. The actuarial team uses predictive modeling techniques based off of certain characteristics of the claim and policy to predict what the expected cost would be for all claims that meet the criteria. In personal auto, there are over 200,000 unique combinations of tabular case reserves. It is important to note that the actuarial algorithm does not expect this one claim to pay exactly the tabular case reserve. But on average, all claims that meet the similar criteria should pay close to the tabular case reserve. This is similar to a pricing rate order of calculation formula. In this example, the tabular case reserve is $12,125.  Finally, the adjuster case reserve as compared to a reserve threshold set at $25,000 in this example. If the adjuster estimate is below the reserve threshold, the tabular case reserve is booked to the general leisure as the financial case reserve for that claim and is reflected on the balance sheet. If the adjuster case reserve is greater than or equal to the threshold, the adjuster case reserve becomes the financial case reserve booked to the general ledger. The logic here is that the predictive modeling approach is fairly accurate for lower dollar claims. For more severe claims, the adjuster has received more specific information pertinent to the claim and will predict better than the model for higher dollar claims. This combination of adjuster and tabular reserves provides more consistency and accuracy on a monthly basis. The threshold varies by several variables, including product, line coverage and limit, just to name a few. Since the adjuster case reserve is $5,000 and below the threshold, the tabular case reserve of $12,125 is used in the general ledger. In addition, $1,000 of IBNR is set to cover claims that happened in December and at some point after December, would either be late reported or reopened. The IBNR reserve is not attached to any one claim and instead, set as a factor related to earned premium to cover all potential late reported or reopened claims.  The total reserve liability on the balance sheet is $12,125 per case, plus $1,000 for IBNR, equaling a total of $13,125 denoted as the dark blue dot and will be the reserve booked at the end of December. In January, the adjuster has kept their initial estimate of $5,000. Since this is below the $25,000 threshold, the tabular case reserve will again be booked to the general ledger. As part of our roll-forward process, all tabular case reserves can be adjusted monthly by an aging factor and inflation factor. As the claim is 1 month older, the actuarial algorithm predicted that all claims remaining open would have a higher ultimate cost.  In addition, all tabular case reserves that are not part of an in-depth actuarial review during the month gets inflated as well. The new tabular case reserve is 12,376, which is an increase of $251. A portion of this $251 increase is aging and a portion is inflation. This will show up in the earnings release as unfavorable prior accident year all other reserve development in January. It is important to note that other claims that settled in January may have settled for more or less than the December tabular case reserve, which would also show up in the all other development category of the earnings release. In February, the adjuster has received new information and increased their estimate to $15,000. This amount is still below the threshold and thus, the tabular case reserve is still used to set the case reserve liability. In February, this claim was part of the 25% to 30% of reserves reviewed at an in-depth level by the actuarial team. The actuarial team increased the tabular case reserve for all claims that have a similar criteria as this claim to $13,500, which is an increase of $1,124 from January.  This increase will show up as unfavorable prior accident year actuarial adjustments in the earnings release. In March, the adjuster increased their estimate again this time to $20,000. Since $20,000 is still below the threshold of $25,000, the tabular case reserve is still used as the case reserve book to the general ledger. The claim becomes plaintiff attorney rep in March, Thus, while the tabular case reserve will be inflated and aged again, it will also change due to becoming plaintiff attorney rep as this is one of the variables used in the actuarial algorithm.  The tabular case reserve is now $20,050 which is $6,550 greater than the prior month. A portion of this $6,550 increase is due to inflation, a portion due to aging and a portion due to the claim becoming plaintiff attorney rep. The $6,550 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release. In April, the adjuster has increased the reserve again to equal to the reserve threshold, the adjustor's estimate is booked to the general ledger as the case reserve for this claim. This is an increase of $4,950 in the case reserve on the balance sheet, moving from the tabular reserve at the end of March to the adjusted reserve at the end of April. The 4,950 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release.  The adjuster made no change to their estimate in May. Case reserves set equal to or over the threshold can only be changed by the adjuster revising their estimates. Thus, there are no additional changes for inflation, aging or any other factors used in the actuarial algorithm. In June, the claim closed out and settled for $20,000. This will show as $5,000 favorable in the prior accident year, all other development section of the monthly earnings release. Finally, in July, the claim was reopened an additional payment occurred for $1,500. A claim could be reopened for several reasons. For example, a claimant may have initially been undecided about a vehicle repair and received a cash settlement based upon the initial estimate. Several months later, they may have ultimately decided to repair the vehicle, and additional damage may have been found. Another example is when a claimant may initially feel that they are not injured in an accident, the claim is closed and subsequently reopened when the person realizes that they were injured in the accident. While the case reserve had closed out in June, we were still carrying $1,000 of IBNR reserves for the potential of a December claim being late reported or reopening. For this example, the IBNR reserve was released in July, which means that there is an expectation that there will be no future costs from late reports or reopens from any accident that occurred in 2022 and is currently not an open case reserve as of the end of July.  The development is unfavorable $500. This would show up in the prior accident year all other category of the earnings release. In practice, the IBNR reserve for prior accident years tends to get released monthly as part of another actuarial algorithm as the probability of late reports and reopens decreases with time. An in-depth review of IBNR reserves are completed in tandem with case reserves. Remember, any changes made to factors by the actuarial team as a result of those reviews will show up under the prior accident year actuarial category. For the year, the starting reserve was $13,125 and the claim was eventually paid for $21,500. The year-to-date development is unfavorable by this difference, which is $8,375. I as the Chief Actuary, have complete decision-making authority on our reserves. And while the actuarial team has complete independence in determining the reserves to be booked, there are many checks and balances in place. Internally, we have a close partnership with our claims, pricing and product management business partners. Meetings are held throughout the month at both a localized and national level discussing trends, changes in the mix of business, claims process changes, rate activity and methodologies.  Quarterly, I meet with the Audit Committee members of the Board of Directors to discuss results and trends for the quarter. Furthermore, our external auditors perform an annual audit of the company as required by the SEC. My actuarial team meets with the audit firm to discuss our actuarial process, current trends and results for the respective quarters and year.  I hope that you have found this presentation helpful. For more information on Progressive's loss reserving practices, we posted a report under the investor site of progressive.com. This report is updated every 2 years. Thank you for your time today. And I will next turn it over to Jim to discuss cohort pricing. Sure. Thanks, Tricia. Great question, Jimmy. So overall, yes, I feel really good about our overall reserve position and where we're at right now. To your point, we have had quite a bit of unfavorable development each of the last 6 months. As Tricia pointed out, if you exclude Florida, all of the development would really be coming from accident year 2022 were actually favorable on accident year '21 and prior.  And within accident year '22, over 85% is from accidents that happened in the last 6 months of the year. And a lot of that relates to the fixing cars and the reopen severity that Tricia was talking about. That's fairly short-tailed. We've seen that come through the data, and we have reacted very quickly to it.  And so that gives me a lot of confidence because of the short tail nature of -- or most of the issue was that we're in a good position right now. At the same time, right, I can't obviously guarantee and the data could change going forward, but I feel really good of our current position. Yes. So that's a good question. So with respect to Florida overall, obviously, the big hit occurred March, April, May. And we've started to see it level out in what's been coming through. Most of June really related to the actuarial adjustments that we took from the reserve reviews primarily related to property damage, third-party fixing cars. So Florida had a very little impact from what we had from the June development. Yes. Good question. So in June, it was the typical 25% to 30% of reserves that were looked at. The comment related to the 100% kind of goes to the part on the reviews that we do not look at in the month. They still will be inflated or unless -- particularly if they're below the threshold, they will be inflated. And they also will be aged.  They also can change. For example, they become plaintiff attorney rep, et cetera. So the potential every month to have 100% of the reserves adjusted somewhat whether it's by an adjuster or whether it's by inflation or aging exists. In terms of our normal process, we typically stay pretty consistent with that 25% to 30%. I would say the only couple of times we might deviate, in December, in particular, because I'm the opining actuary for the statutory reserves. If we are seeing additional information, we may add a review or 2 to make sure that the statutory companies are in the correct position as of year-end. And then, obviously, for something like Florida when the House Bill passes, we would go in immediately with new information from that and do an adjustment. Yes, that's correct. So I think Tricia's spot on there. The one thing I would add, Tracy, to your point, the property damage severity that you're showing, that's for all claims, if we stratified and only looked at the reopen severity, which is really where the reserve actual adjustments have come from. The reopen severity is well above and has been increasing over those quarters relative to the 13%, 14% you're seeing. Yes. We are. So I think to your point, even though the overall is trending down some, the reopen severity, we believe, on the current accident year has been trending up. And so a lot of those actuarial adjustments, both on prior and current year are reflecting the elevated reopen severity. Even though, to your point, the overall has come down, that is a different trend if you just look at only the reopen severity, which is really what's driving a lot of the reserves. Yes. I think Tricia is spot on there. The only couple of things I'd add from the reserve side is we tend to look at the data off of an accident period basis, right, as opposed to reported calendar information. The accident period data is more smooth, right, on a calendar basis, you can get some movements up or down, sometimes with changes in mix or closures, et cetera.  So on an accident period basis, we're a little bit lower than what that shows. The other thing what Tricia alluded to is there's some large loss mix, et cetera. If you think back to that presentation, that's one of the reasons we employ that reserve threshold. So when our claims adjusters identify those large losses, once it's above that threshold, they put that up immediately. So it's recognized in the reserves. And again, there could be a little bit a timing difference between the accident period and the calendar period, which you would see."

            "name": "Jim Curtis",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. Now let's transition from estimating ultimate losses in LAE to another key element of our pricing, which is our expected lifetime value. We price each policy written to a lifetime target consistent with our enterprise goal of a 96 combined ratio. We refer to this as cohort pricing where a cohort is defined by policies written at new business and followed through their expected lifetime value, including all renewal terms. Lifetime performance is measured as the sum of all expenses realized and the premium earned across all new and renewal terms for a policy. When I say all expenses, by that, I mean loss, LAE, acquisition expenses and operational expenses. As you can see by the stylized chart, loss and expense costs vary between new and renewal policy terms. With this in mind, we price across the policy life to achieve a lifetime 96 combined ratio. Said another way, the sum of lifetime loss and expenses divided by lifetime earned premium, nets us at 96 combined. This pricing approach positions us to offer a competitive rate of new business and stable rates across renewals.  Now that we have a conceptual view of cohort pricing, let's dig into the mechanics. The following is a tabular representation of the lifetime view we covered in the last graph. We think about pricing in 3 separate categories: loss in LAE, acquisition expense and operational expense. Loss and LAE represent our indemnity experience. We break out our expense ratio into acquisition and operational expenses. And in all cases, renewal business operates at a total lower cost structure than the first term or our new business. While we price to the lifetime profitability of our policies at a 96 or better, we also manage this approach with consideration to our calendar year goal of meeting a 96 or better-combined ratio. Next will explore each individual category or line item and finish with our management of cohort pricing within our calendar year 96 goal. Let's start with loss and LAE expense. Loss ratio improves from new business to renewal and is primarily a function of mix of business and policy life expectancy. And we priced to that expected lifetime loss ratio performance based on the characteristics at new business, which ensures the business written is priced to a lifetime target.  Starting in the upper left in this illustrative example, you can see that our first-term business runs at a loss and LAE ratio of 85% with our renewal book of business at 77%. With an expected policy life of 6 policy terms, the lifetime loss and LAE ratio is at 78%. When combined with our other expense categories, the lifetime CR is at 96%, thereby combining new and renewal performance and achieving our lifetime target. However, within the new-to-renewal loss ratio performance, there are segmentation opportunities as not all policy characteristics at new business have the same expected lifetime loss ratio performance. Building on this with an illustrative example, consider car color starting in the upper right. When looking at the expected renewal improvement from new business in loss ratio on red cars, we see a larger change than we expect to see in green cars.  The implication for pricing are twofold. First, we observed that red cars last on average 5 policy terms and green cars last on average 7 policy terms. The second consideration is that the loss behavior also varies. We priced at this differential in expected policy life expectancy and the different improvement in indemnity performance between the 2 segments, in this illustrative case car color. Applying this to a real-life opportunity, we frequently discuss key consumer segments as Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons and our continued opportunity for growth in the Robinsons segment. As a refresher, Robinsons, our consumers who bundle their home and auto needs and typically have a longer policy life expectancy. We can recognize this policy extension and build it into our pricing, which ultimately leads to lower rates with more lifetime renewal premium at a lower cost structure. Finally, while I focused on the indemnity piece of cohort pricing, you'll also note that the policy life expectancy can affect the other expense categories.  We'll move into the distribution channel and acquisition costs next. Before we dig deeper into acquisition expenses, we need to first review the fundamental differences between the direct channel and the independent agency channel. While we price both channels to a lifetime 96, the economics differ in both how we account for the acquisition cost and relatedly, the timing of those costs. Starting on the left, Direct has an upfront acquisition expense by virtue of our marketing spend. We spend consumer marketing dollars, media and nonmedia alike and account for the entire acquisition expense in the new business term. We can see that in the illustrative example with a 60% acquisition expense ratio on the first term and 0% on subsequent renewal terms.  Again, this reinforces the lifetime value of extending policy life expectancy. With the independent agency channel, policies are acquired at the cost of commission paid to the agent. The commission expense is paid to the agent and ultimately reflects a percentage of premium earned by policy term. Unlike Direct, we see a much smaller acquisition expense in the first term, which reflects the commission paid on that term, and we see additional expense in renewal policies also reflecting a percentage of premium earned. In both cases, in this dialyzed example, lifetime acquisition expense is 10%, and we achieved a 96% combined ratio, but we have a much larger first-term expense in Direct and a higher renewal expense in Agency. Let's look at each distribution channel in a little more detail. We'll start by spending more time on how policy life expectancy is a key component to our direct acquisition economics. Consider 2 policies with different PLEs. In policy #1, we see a total of 6 policy terms with a target acquisition expense of 60% on that first term. With an average policy premium of about $750, we can assume our rate level considers about a $450 acquisition expense, which is about 10% across the entire life of the policy. In other words, 750 x 6 policy terms is 4,500 and the $450 policy acquisition expense is 10% over that lifetime premium.  Now let's move to policy #2. Holding all else constant, but the policy life expectancy, you can see the first term assumptions produces the same 450 permissible or 60% of 750. However, with the addition of 2 policy terms, the acquisition expense of $450 million is now 8% of total policy lifetime premium. Said another way, we invested the same $450 in policy acquisition as we did in policy #1, but we see the benefit the PLE extension gives us as a lower acquisition expense as a percentage of lifetime premium. We can segment our pricing to capture differences in policy life expectancy. Depending on market conditions, we can either increase the allowable to drive additional demand or we can lower our rate level to increase our new business conversion. In both cases, we will still achieve a lifetime 96. A real-life example would be our continued segmentation efforts, reflecting our consumer marketing segments and correspondingly, our investment to acquire Robinsons. Again, those who bundle home and auto, which carry a longer policy life expectancy compared to those who don't bundle their home and auto with Progressive.  Moving on to the Agency channel. This distribution business model takes a different form, as I mentioned, we pay commission to agents. In the example above, the policy achieves a lifetime 96, but you can see that the acquisition expense ratio is the same between the first policy term and the remaining 5 renewal terms. This is possible because we pay commission by policy term and ultimately unearned premium. In practice, it is possible to vary commission by new and renewal. However, even in this scenario, the combined ratio implications will likely be much flatter than what we see in our direct economics. Because we pay a percent of commission is earned, acquisition costs and dollars will vary based on policy premium, but as a percentage of premium, we'll always match.  This is a key element in cohort pricing as the dollars may vary, but the expense as a percentage of the premium will be the same. We still see cohort performance that has an overall higher cost structure in new business, but it is proportionately more in an indemnity and operational expense relative to our direct business model. Finally, we finished with operational expenses, and we see a modest new renewal differential. The operational cost for servicing new business policies is greater than the operational cost for renewal terms. The remaining other category includes things like bad debt or unpaid balances on earned premiums. We extend coverage on a canceled policy and did not receive payment. This happens with greater frequency on new business. We see these expense differentials consistently and can also price them into our product. Calendar year earnings have an implicit new and renewal mix driving results, and we manage that mix to ensure target combined ratios are achieved for the calendar year-end question.  While managing our new renewal mix, we consider both the mix of our cohorts and the rate revisions earning in. Remember that rate from revisions take time to earn in as policies have to renew into the new rate level. Typically, this happens in our new business faster than renewal as our rates hit the marketplace before our renewal book. This will affect the combined ratio performance of our new business and renewal cohorts. Setting rate changes aside, periods of accelerated new business application growth can apply upward pressure on our combined ratio, as we now know, new business has a higher expected combined ratio and in the case of Direct has additional pressure based on our accounting of consumer marketing expense. Using this stylized example, you can see that in a period of high growth, new business makes up a larger portion of our total earned premium. And while we may be within our lifetime targets, we see our calendar combined ratio pierce the 96. To manage this, we can slow growth and thereby reduce the mix of new business earned premiums, which results in a combined ratio less than our 96 goals. And in both cases, we are within our cohort targets.  This is a great example of how we develop our media budget. We consider both our lifetime economics and our margin position considering each simultaneously with calendar year performance taking priority, and we then adjust our budget accordingly. Upward pressure from new business can be dampened by the lengthening of policy life expectancy as our renewal book becomes a larger portion of the overall book of business. With the expected combined ratio improvement, we can use that to manage new and renewal earned premium mix. As you can see, as it relates to our expected cohort performance, we price across the lifetime of a policy and balance our near-term and long-term growth with our 96 calendar year goal. Thank you for your time. Sure. Also a good question. A couple of ways to think about that. There's several dimensions to consider when thinking about mix. So to your point about any type of lag function when we write business, it's in written premium, but doesn't necessarily hit our earned premium mix until it starts to age or get into the policy term.  So we would see on a 6-month basis, roughly 3 to 4 months later, where you start to see your earned premium mix shift. That would work in both ways, periods of growth on new business apps and periods of slowing our new business apps. Yes, I would -- and I would build on that, that the expense does hit immediately. The earned premium mix would -- really would start to see some measure of reaction in our indemnity performance. Sure. We also consider different time periods and just typical when looking at data set, longer time period, more credibility and more confidence we have. We'll look at recent time period as just a leading indicator adjust slowly. My team set sort of our permissible acquisition as an example, and we just go through that exact process. Sure. We measure that by our permissible compared to actual. Actual is defined as our media spend or consumer marketing spend and income and volume apps, with what we believe to be as a sort of heightened dislocation in the marketplace, a lot of shopping, which we hold our conversion level that will drive our cost per sale down. And so in the current period, we'd be pretty efficient. And then it's a matter of managing our media budget to our calendar year position."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I usually begin these calls by extolling the commitment of Progressive's people and expressing my pride in the results they deliver, and this quarter will be no different. In the face of extraordinary pressure on the industry, our people continue to take the actions necessary to succeed in this difficult environment.  While our results through the first half of 2023 fell well short of our 96 combined ratio target. I continue to believe in our people and our strategy. I believe we have assembled a progressive team of nearly 59,000 employees that's best in class. I have no doubt that we are continuing to lay the groundwork to ensure that our best days are ahead of us. We continue to manage to this calendar year target, maintaining the discipline that has allowed us to grow in the past with better profitability than the industry.  At the same time, we will be pragmatic in our approach to growth and remain cognizant of long-term value, which we continue to believe has served well by balancing growth and profitability. We spent much of the first quarter call talking about actions we would be taking to address our calendar year profitability pressure and those actions continue. In quarter 2, we took 7 points in personal auto, which puts our year-to-date rate take at just over 11%, and assuming regulatory approval, we plan to take approximately 6 additional points during the remainder of the year as we adjust rates to match loss trend.  During last quarter's call, we also said that we would reduce our media spend, resulting in our quarter 2 direct expense ratio being amongst the lowest in recent history. These actions have had the expected effect on growth with new app growth slower in the second quarter as compared to the first and PIF growth, while still robust, slowing from highs we saw in prior months. Calendar year profitability continues to be a challenge. So with the calendar year 96 goal in mind, we will continue to evaluate the rate and non-rate actions we may need to take.  Catastrophe losses were a significant part of our profitability pressures. To date, 2023 has been a significant catastrophic year with some estimates suggesting that U.S. insurer losses have already surpassed $25 billion this year. The events this year had been broadly felt with 44 states affected by 43 events. At the company level, these events have added 4.5 points to our combined ratio year-to-date, which is 1.7 points higher than the impact catastrophe events had on our combined ratio for the first half of 2022.  Our property business has been most affected by catastrophes, adding almost 46 points to the property loss ratio so far this year, which is about 16 points more when compared to this time in 2022. Historically, we have been among the best in the industry in reserve accuracy with reserve changes contributing little to our calendar year combined ratio. We've advanced the science of reserving, an employee team of highly experienced individuals to support our goal of being as accurate as possible with our reserves.  Accurate reserves help us to price more accurately and give us the confidence to grow as fast as we have over the last decade. Having said that, the difficult environment of 2023 has presented challenges for our reserving practices. Through the end of the second quarter, prior year adverse development has contributed 4 points to our combined ratio and current accident year actuarial adjustments have contributed another 1.5 points. The majority of personal lines adverse development can be placed into 2 categories: Florida and fixing vehicle coverages. Florida's prior year adverse development accounts for just over 40% of the 4 points of prior year development. While we continue to be optimistic that March's new legislation will result in lower loss costs over time, the short-term effect has been a significant increase in attorney representation largely in medical coverages.  Our data has matured each month since the bill passed, which has allowed us to continue to fine-tune reserving in the face of changes to Florida's ultimate loss costs. In fixing vehicle coverages, unforeseen severity trends deepening on previously closed claims continues to be the major driver of prior year adverse development countrywide. The contributors to the steeper trends come from a variety of sources, including longer vehicle repair times, longer rental times, higher parts prices and labor rates and changes in subrogation trends. Fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, which explains why over 80% of the total year-to-date prior-year development is from the 2022 accident year.  In fact, excluding Florida, accident years prior to 2022 have developed favorably. Our current year actuarial adjustments are primarily due to fixing vehicle coverages. Since fixing vehicle coverages are short-tailed, most of the claims that are affected by emerging trends have happened in the recent past. As we have moved deeper into the year, the new steeper trends in fixing vehicle coverages have increasingly affected claims that occurred in the current accident year.  Florida litigation has been a relatively small part of current year actuarial adjustments since the increase in attorney representation rates largely affected claims that occurred before March of 2023. We continue to monitor loss trends across all states and coverages and will adjust if necessary to ensure we're always adequately reserved. While both reserving and pricing have been a challenge this year, I have great confidence in the teams and our strategies, which have delivered results better than the industry for a very long time. To showcase these skill sets, this morning, we have 2 senior leaders to speak to these 2 topics for our presentation. First, Gary Traicoff, our Corporate Actuary business leader and Head of our Reserving Group, will discuss reserving practice at Progressive and how we endeavor to accurately set and adjust reserves. Gary is a 28-year progressive veteran and has led our reserving group for almost 11 of those years. After Gary, Jim Curtis, our Personal Lines Controller, will discuss cohort pricing. Cohort pricing is our term for managing to both our calendar year and lifetime 96 target when new business and renewal business have different expense and loss characteristics. Jim has been with Progressive for 28 years and in his current role for 4.  Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now pass you to Gary. Gary? Thanks, Elyse. We really don't share our trend selects normally. But obviously, we've been seeing the trends in shorter-tail business increase as just the repairs to vehicles have slowed down. And when we look at that in overall kind of both frequency and severity, we think we're at 6 right now. And just like I said in the last call that could range. But at this juncture, we think we need another 6, so about 17-ish for the full year. It will certainly get close. Again, all the caveats I said last time with weather. We feel much better about our reserving because of those losses being short-tailed, and we started seeing those at the end of last year. So I believe Gary really got out in front of that. It will certainly get us closer. But again, all the caveats and the uncertainty that we've felt for the last 3 years kind of are underlying that assumption. Yes. What I would say to that is as those 2022 rates earned in that I put on one of the slides that I had, we believe we're putting on the books both new and renewal business that is closer to or below our targets, our accident year targets, I should say, in both channels on a year-to-date basis. So we feel good about where we're at in the business we're putting on the book in 2023. Yes. I think we have our arms around it. I mean for BI, obviously, we try to keep ahead of that trend. When we see it, we react to it, and we're in line with the industry. This has been a very unusual time. As you know, if you've looked over the last couple of years, and you've seen the Manheim used car index and how that's flowed. Even though you're seeing it tick down a little bit, it still is a very big difference in what you saw in 2018 and 2019. So when we look at that, especially as we looked at the second half of last year, we really started to see the trend, specifically in property damage, but also in collision increase. And it's really -- and we're watching it flow through in our claims organization.  So you have -- let's take the property damage example. Somebody is taking care -- another one of our carriers -- competitors taking care of their insured, but they're going to subrogate us. So that accident happens today. And there's no shop capacity for that particular hit. So they do an estimate as best they can with the sheet metal still in the car. Let's say it's drivable, for this example. And they continue to drive. The shop can get it in 45 days from now, maybe 60 days from now. It comes in, they get the sheet metal off of it, oh, lo and behold, there's more damage. Those supplements are more frequent, and they're more expensive.  So you're having capacities, longer cycle times, longer rental times. I think I said in my letter, the rental time, we're seeing it go down a little bit, and that's one data point. So we'll continue to watch that. But you've got that, and then you've got labor rates and parts increase. So in terms of your question, the stickiness, will likely be based on wages for workers in the body shop.  So there -- recently a Wall Street Journal article that talked about automotive repair workers, their salaries increased 24% in quarter 4 of 2022 compared to 2018. So 20% over the last year, and that was from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And making cars be in the same position, the indemnification of the vehicles has also soared since 2018, about 36%.  So I do think we might see some trends like in used car prices as the supply chain issues came through and new, et cetera. That might continue to go down. But I think some of the other things will be part of our new normal. Well, as we attempt to get to our calendar year 96 where there's always levers we can pull, clearly, I'd rather be in a different position where we're spending more money on media and continuing to grow as long as, of course, that would be at our target profit margins. We have a lot of discipline within the company as well in terms of expenses in times such as these. So we -- obviously, we'll continue to look at that for this next 6 months to see if we can get closer to that 96. I'll let Gary weigh in on that. I would say from where I sit, I'm much more comfortable. But again, Gary is independent and does his reserve reviews without my involvement. I hear about that just a little bit before you do. So Gary, why don't you weigh in a little bit. Thanks, Gary. Yes. And all I would say in addition to that is as soon as the House Bill 837 went through, and then we had the subsequent lawsuits that I talked about, we went in and were pretty aggressive and conservative because we were trying to figure out what was estimable and probable. And that will develop over time as those also get settled. So that's not something that we'll know right away because those take a little bit longer to settle. I'll let Jim talk about that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot more that goes into it than just the acquisition expense. A lot has to do with losses, and there could be uncertainty around catastrophes, et cetera. But Jim, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Well, I think we always -- each data point. And as we get more confidence, of course, we were able to do that. We saw an increase in PLE on both the 12 months and 3 months. I'd like to see a couple more data points because there's a lot of shopping in the industry. And obviously, you're looking at the same data we are from the industry, and there's a lot from movement from rates. So I would say there's hundreds of variables that we look at when we think about that. And we'll continue to do so, again, in this uncertain environment. Jim, do you want to add anything? Have you seen that with how nimble we've been with our pricing over the year? As we've seen things we've made changes. We are as anxious as likely our shareholders to grow. But again, we have a very specific core value of profit on a calendar year 96. And so that's a priority. I think it's a little bit less of an issue. I think anytime you have the growth we've had and with the labor environment that has been around for a couple of years, it's a challenge. I will say at this juncture, we are fully staffed in our claims organization. So we feel really great about that and turnover is continuing to go down.  That said, our tenure is still low. And so with that comes just the learning curve from that. And our Claims President is having the newer people definitely are in the office with supervisors because that's really where you learn a lot and you get up to speed very quickly, and we have a lot of processes in order to do that.  But I would say, if you asked me that a year ago, it would be a different answer than today. I feel confident in our claims organization, the action they're taking. And as tenure continues to grow, I think we'll be in a great position for accuracy. Josh, that's a great question, one we obviously ask ourselves. And in fact, I was recently onboarding a new director on our Board. And I let her know that are, in my mind, as I lead the organization, there are 2 things that are sacrosanct here: our 5 core values at our 96 calendar year combined ratio.  So I'm going to -- this is going to be a longer answer, but I think it's one that a lot of the -- a lot of your analysts -- the analysts have asked Doug. And so I think it's worth the time for -- just me to walk through a little bit how we think about this on the profit side, the growth side and the capital side.  So let me first begin by reiterating our core values and, of course, one is profit -- public in 1971. And ever since that date, it's been publicly talked about, probably prior to that, I just don't have the evidence in writing. But like all our other core values, profits, it's not a value of convenience, where we look to waver from it depending on the business. It's really how we guide our business. It's an all-in number. We don't manage to an underlying even though that's obviously something we look at, but it can't be exclusive of catastrophes or adverse development or reserve development of any kind because that's part of being the business of insurance. How it reads -- it's our profit core value states. We have a responsibility to ourselves, our customers, agents and investors to be a profitable and enduring company by offering products and services consumers value. It's part of what makes and has made Progressive so successful. We inject the discipline of putting profits before growth, and we've built a business that has delivered better than industry results consistently for a very long time. That consistency in which we've been able to deliver on our profit target is a significant part of the share price multiples we enjoy today. Like now when profits are under pressure, we take action quickly and aggressively. And by taking action quickly and aggressively, we not only meet our targets, we've also put business that reaches or exceeds our goals and deflect business that doesn't. You might remember, because you've been around for a while, over 7 years ago when I took over this role, I took the opportunity to publicly commit to some objectives that we've written about for years. And I just want to take a moment to reiterate one of those. It's outlined in our annual report in our policy section, but I think it's worth repeating.  For us, a 96 combined ratio is not a solve for variable in our business model equation, but rather a constant that provides direction to each product and marketing decision and a cultural shipping point that ensures 0 ambiguity as to how to act in certain situations. Set at a level we believe create a fair balance between attractive profitability and consumer competitiveness, it's deeply ingrained and central to our culture.  I can't really stress that enough. It's part of the fabric of our culture and really embedded in everything we do along with the other 4 core values. It's true our published accident year ratios are lower than the calendar year ratios and closer to our targets. However, that's the moment in time. And I really have said several times in prior calls that uncertainty is a new normal since the onset of the pandemic, and that remains true today.  So for us, growing fast in an uncertain future, before profit is addressed it's a recipe for sustained profit pain. Many insurance companies make this misstep, and we don't intend to repeat those mistakes. But let me go to growth because I think that's the story that we're not hearing enough as well.  I wanted to remind everyone of the significant growth we've had in the first half of 2023. In 6 months, we've added 2.2 million policies in force. And we've increased written premiums by over $5 billion, and that's the equivalent of adding a top 10 Personal Auto carrier. So I would say growth this year could be defined as spectacular.  Ambient shopping, and you brought that up, does remain elevated. Our agency channel is actually the best barometer for industry shopping levels because it's less affected by media expenditures. And that channel quotes were up about 16% in the quarter. If we had perfect knowledge about the future and knew that we, for sure, had adequate rates, undoubtedly, there's opportunity for significant growth today.  But that said, growth opportunities today do not preclude the possibility of growth opportunities tomorrow. You've probably watched in the past, and we've taken rates and other underwriting actions to focus on achieving our profitability goal. We've proven to be better positioned for strong growth in the following periods: 2022 was among the worst years for industry Personal Auto profitability and so far, 2023 has been worse.  While we can't know the future, current market conditions suggest there'll be opportunity to increase market share in the future. And then just let me wrap up by saying growth can't happen without growing surplus. Our capital position today is strong, and we believe we have plenty of capital to support the premium growth we expect.  We have a structured growth business that is largely self-funding internally through underwriting profits and investment returns. So to bring us back full circle, our profit core value is the key to sustained growth. I know that was a long answer, but I think it's really important to be super clear and unambiguous about how we think about the business. I hope that answered your question, and hopefully, others. Yes, I think you're spot on. We are trying to have more and more of the Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We love Sams as long as we can make our target profit margin, but we continue to increase our bundle. And as we think about both auto and property, those bundles are more important. So we've increased our Robinsons over time. And then, of course, we've talked about this in the past, and it's probably worth an update at some point in the next couple of quarters.  The soon-to-be Robinsons. So it could be a Diane that's buying a house, et cetera. So we'll continue to try to be a place for every cohort, but we have increased our Robinsons profile in the last several years. And of course, during times like this, Sams are going to shop more because they're very incented by price. Well, I think -- we don't talk about retention with each of the profiles of our consumers, the marketing tiers. But we do look over time. And historically, Robinsons have fared better. And we find that the more products you have, the stickier you're going to be. And Sams, especially if there's other characteristics to go, can -- last about the same months and haven't varied too much over the years. But although we don't share it, I would say Robinsons continue to be stickier. Well, good question, Tracy. You remember our 96 is an aggregate. So we look at it differently for new business, renewal business. We've taken to the assumptions of our PLE products, state, although it all goes up to 96, which I don't think will change. One, thing, we do look at a really granular level; and two, I think we want to watch this playthrough because some of these changes came about pretty quickly in the delays. And a lot of it is really the shop capacity. And as that starts to open up with the exception of what I talked about with labor rates and probably prices, I think we could be priced adequately and continue to keep our 96 calendar year and lifetime goal. That would be my approach. Well, we had a lot of rate increases come in, so that was one of them. And a lot of our property, if you take -- if you look at the property and the cat load on top of it or the -- I should say, the cats we've had, you can take that into account. But it is -- that 80% of that, I think you did the quarterly number, but 80% of that $1.1 billion on the year-to-date was auto, 50% was cars, about 35-ish percent was Florida, glass, PIP, BI. And then the rest was IBNR and BI across the country, but property did not -- did develop favorably. Gary, do you want to add anything? As long as we look at the data and feel good about where we're at with our combined ratio on overall calendar year and accident year, we will grow as fast as we can. So that has been our objective for a long time, 96, grow as fast as we can. We want to do that. We're a growth company. We feel great about it. But again, profits over growth. But as soon as we feel confident with the little stability and less uncertainty, we are very prepared to grow. Yes. Yes. We don't know how the next 6 months will go. We're going to do the best we can. But again, like you said, if something happens, that is above and beyond that would be different. But yes, we will continue to grow. And in 2024 would be a new year as long as we felt that we had the policies on the book that we believe are at or below our new and renewal targets. From Florida, you mean? Well, we clearly need to get a rate. So that's one part of the formula. We also have really had a lot of restrictions from an underwriting perspective. on new business. And so those are some other things that go into it. We have a line of sight, but again, we'll caveat that by all the comments regarding uncertainty that I've said before. I'll start, and then Gary can weigh in. About half of the BI was actuarial reserves, but it's pretty much in line with the industry. So we're not too concerned about it. A lot of them are soft tissue, attorney rep but not litigated. So they do take longer. But I feel like we're in a good position and understand where they're headed. And I think in a better position than we were even a year ago. Gary, do you want to add anything?"

I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be a moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60-minute schedule for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60-minute schedule for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\nSusan Griffith: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. One of the enduring lessons since the onset of the pandemic is the uncertainty of the future. Since March 2020, the world and our business have been pummeled by unforeseen events. In that vein is perhaps poetic that 3 years post pandemic, we continue to have to manage through the unexpected in our business. In the end, I'm confident that our resilience will see us through.  Through the first quarter, we're not on track to achieve our calendar year goal of a 96 combined ratio. Given our extensive history of meeting our stated goals, this has prompted many questions about how we got here and where we're going. As such, in lieu of a more traditional opening statement, I'll instead provide answers to some questions that have been asked by the investment analysts. My hope is that you will gain a clear understanding of how we are addressing the challenges as well as the urgency with which we are acting. The first question is, how are you reacting to being above your target of a 96 calendar year combined ratio. The answer to that is we will react to the same way we always have with speed and decisiveness. The 3 largest levers we have to manage our margin are to decrease our expense ratio, tighten our verification and underwriting scrutiny of new business and increased rates. I'll address these in that order. Our largest controllable variable expense is advertising spend, and we are taking action to reduce these costs, which we expect could both slow growth and help to reduce our expense ratio. Once we are confident that we can deliver our target calendar year profitability, we will consider resuming our spend. While we won't provide details on which segments of media we are reducing or how this may affect growth going forward, I will tell you that we've invested in bringing the same industry-leading science from the pricing side of our business to the acquisition side, and we'll continue to spend in the places that we believe have the greatest benefit to the business. Using non-rate actions such as tighter verification and underwriting standards and limiting bill plan options, will reduce our growth in the segments we believe we can't currently write at our target margins.  Finally, our largest and slowest moving lever is rates. In quarter 1, we took 4 points of rate in Personal Auto on an aggregate country-wide basis, and we are still earning in some of the prior year rate increases. We plan to take aggressive rate increases where needed across all lines through the balance of 2023 to ensure we're pricing to deliver our target profit margin. The next question, given the actions we will take to meet our profit target is, what will this do to growth? First and foremost, keep in mind that growth in the first quarter of 2023 was an all-time high for the company, and we are very proud of that. Secondly, we are still in a very hard market with lots of consumers quoting their insurance. We also continue to see ambient shopping. While policy growth may be slowed by our actions, we still anticipate there will continue to be robust demand for our products. Of course, the actions of our competitors also play a role in what growth will be. So I won't speculate on specific growth predictions. However, you can rest assured that we are focused on growing policies that we believe will meet or exceed our target margins. Lastly, we've received many questions like this one. Do you now believe your reserving is adequate? Or said another way, you said that you were confident that the biggest rate increases were behind you, what changed? The answer is fairly basic. We started seeing data come in over the last few months that was not in line with what we were anticipating, which caused us to increase reserves and react with rate increases.  In Personal Lines, our reserve strengthening happened largely in the short-tailed fixing vehicle coverages. In these coverages, we can recognize and react to new trends relatively quickly, and we feel good about our reserve levels today. That being said, reserves are estimates and change over time based on evolving trends. As for the effects of Florida House Bill 837. In March, we estimated the reserve changes we believe we needed to capture the effect of the legislation, including the flood of lawsuits triggered by the law change. The reserve increases we took in March represented our best estimate of what we believe would be the full effect of the lawsuits on loss costs for prebill accident periods. Going forward, we believe the legislation takes positive steps to help manage the cost of auto insurance for Florida consumers. However, the situation is evolving, and we will continue to assess and react to information as it develops. In Commercial Lines, again, we believe we are adequately reserved today and are monitoring trends in frequency and severity to ensure we remain adequately reserved. Of course, any assumption on reserve adequacy comes with a caveat that trends can change. If they do, we will react to them as appropriate. The follow-up to the reserving adequacy question is, how did you miss reserving trends in the recent past? And given that, how can you be confident in your current reserve adequacy? I'll address these questions individually. The business of insurance is predicting the future. We never know our full cost of goods sold until years after premiums are collected. As such, our reserves are, by nature, estimates of our exposures based on assumptions. We use historical data, extensive knowledge about our business and customers and advanced analytics to predict ultimate loss costs usually with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Predicting the future is hard, however, and we didn't fully predict trends that developed during the quarter. We saw higher-than-expected severity trends in previously closed claims in Personal Auto, primarily in fixing vehicle coverages. While I won't speculate on why these trends change, I can tell you that we reacted quickly and decisively to adjust our reserves for these short-tail coverages. I'm confident in the people and processes we have in place to ensure we're adequately reserved.  For the 5 years ending 2022, prior year reserve development averaged about 0.25 points unfavorable on our year-end combined ratio, which I believe supports the statement that we always strive to set reserves adequately. Hopefully, these questions and answers address some of the most sought-after explanations of the first quarter. Rest assured that no one is more acutely aware of the results of the first quarter than myself, my team and all the people at Progressive. I continue to be confident in the long-term direction we're headed, and I a little doubt will continue to do everything we can to achieve our goals. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions.\nA - Douglas Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: Thanks for the helpful prepared remarks. As a follow-up to the Florida comments, can you elaborate on the legislation? You said the situation is evolving. But you said -- you also said you feel that the legislation is positive. So now ultimately, sometimes past, has there been less claims in Florida in April due to the legislation. Do you feel like it has teeth and there could be kind of a payback for the charges that were taken to the influx of claims?\nSusan Griffith: Good question, Mike, thanks. So we think the long-term effects of the legislation as it's written today would be very positive for the consumers of Florida. In the meantime, we're very familiar with the plaintiff bar, and we don't know that they will not try to challenge those. So what we did in March was we took a look at the fact that more lawsuits were being filed. And every time we consider our cost we look at, is it estimable and probable. And that's why we strengthened the reserve for possible and likely lawsuits that are going to occur between the time that the governor talked about the legislative bill and the time that he signed it.  In fact, in March, there were 280,000 lawsuits filed in Florida, not ours, overall in Florida, civil lawsuits, which is up nearly 130%, the all-time high of May 2021. So significant lawsuits. So short term, we are going to prepare to obviously get through those long term, this will be good. So a couple of good things that came out of the House Bill 837. Comparative laws changed from pure to modify comparatives. So if you're greater than 50%, you don't collect. The statute limitations is from 4 years to 2 years. There's a safe harbor for bad faith, which is really important to us because it takes some time when you get into claim to actually gather the information to make to actually start to negotiate if there's a demand and probably most importantly, repealing one way attorney fees. There's a little bit more than that, but we think those are really good.  In the short term, though, we -- this could evolve, and we don't know if it will be challenged. And so we will just react accordingly as we have more information. But overall, we feel very good about the law changes, and we think it's really good more importantly for the consumers of Florida.\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. That's helpful. And my final follow-up, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but pivoting to Personal Lines growth, which has been excellent. I'm trying to juxtapose the comments you made -- what we're seeing is the new applications that appear to be record levels with kind of your comments about needing to take maybe some corrective actions. It sounds like you still feel like Progressive will be a meaningful market share CAGR. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Would that be ultimately, there's more shopping and on average, Progressive's rates are lower than most of your customers. So as long as the industry is taking a lot of rate, you still feel good about the absolute level of growth.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean I think at any time you reduce advertising, the likelihood of growth on subsiding a little bit is going to happen. We see that in our data. And we have seen our competitors take rate compared to us and even more so -- even more than us. So the hard market really has to do with our people shopping, and they are. So we do feel still bullish on our growth. Let me give you a couple of key stats because I didn't talk about those. I talked a little bit about the new apps, which were tremendous in the all-time history of the company. But let me give you a couple of other interesting stats that we feel really incredible about.  So this quarter, we grew policies in force $1.4 million. We grew premium $2.6 billion, which is approximately like 1 point of market share. If you look at even like a 12-month span, we've grown more than $5 billion. And if you think about that, that's the size of a top 10 carrier. So those are a couple I think, interesting an extraordinary tidbits that we feel good about. Also, when you look at growth, you're going to look at both unit growth and premium growth. So maybe unit growth subsides a little bit, we really don't know. We just know that sometimes when you reduce advertising, when you increase advertising, there's the inverse relationship. But there's also premium growth. So as we take more rate to get to our target profit margin, you're going to see some premium growth. And ultimately, our goal is that you'll also see our margins widen.\nJohn Sauerland: Mike, the one point I'd add on that is, we don't live in a vacuum, obviously. And our actions I would say, all else equal, will certainly adversely affect growth, less advertising dollars, higher rates for sure. But as we saw last year, as the competitive marketplace was in a bit of disarray even with our aggressive actions, we saw growth. So it will remain to be seen what our competitors do in this environment that we are currently experiencing and if they react aggressively as well, then obviously, our growth won't be as adversely affected.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I wanted to get some additional color on the magnitude of additional rates you guys are looking to take from here. In the 10-Q and in your comments, you mentioned being aggressive with rates, raising rates over the remainder of the year. So more specifically, like within Personal Auto, when you say aggressive rates, is that in the low single digits, in the high single digits? Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of rate increases you're now expecting to take?\nSusan Griffith: Sure. I assume that would come up when I didn't give a number. we're going to take as much rate as we need to try to get to our target profit margin. I believe what we've shown, not just over this inflationary period, but over decades with Progressive, that we execute on our ability to do that. We have a great pricing group, a great rate revision group. So we know we can do that. Now there's all the caveats of regulatory approval, what can happen with weather, which could increase or decrease our desire to have more rates. And of course, it's very specific state, channel product, et cetera. What I would say at this point in time, and again, all the caveats that this is really quite a dynamic time. We think we'll take in the neighborhood of around 10 more points this year to catch up and stay ahead of trend in private passenger auto. So low single digits. But again, that could be 8% to 12%. We don't know. Right now, that's our plan as of today. We're watching as things unfold.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then could you maybe break down your business for us, the portion you just said, right, 8% to 12% price needed, but the portion of the book that needs rate versus perhaps the portion that you're still looking to grow in? Is there a way to kind of give us a sense of which percentage, and I'm really concerned in talking about Personal Auto, would still perhaps be where you might be looking to grow versus the portion where you just think you need these aggressive level of rate?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. From an auto perspective, we always want to grow as fast as we can, but we are limited sometimes with the regulatory approvals. So obviously, there are places where we haven't got as much rate as we've needed, think the Coast, which we've talked about before, going to need more on those because we've been waiting for some rate increases in some of those states. Some are less where we feel like we're ahead of it. We don't really want to go into details, but suffice it to say, on a country-wide average, we think in the neighborhood about 10% additional this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of them here for you, Tricia. The first one, Tricia, I remember back to 2016 and all of the discussion about new business penalty as you're growing pretty rapidly. What's the impact of that new business penalty on your Personal Auto results today or in this quarter?\nSusan Griffith: Well, I think in this quarter, our media expense was up, so you're going to feel that especially on the direct side since we front-load those costs. So I think I said this in the last call. I sort of look at new business penalty as an investment in our future and having our future policyholders. But you did see a higher expense ratio, and we were -- we still had our pedal on for media spend in that first -- in the first quarter this year. So yes, expenses were higher.\nBrian Meredith: I was thinking more on loss ratio side actually, just because new business typically carries a higher loss ratio.\nSusan Griffith: Yes, yes, new business does carry a higher loss ratio. That was part of it as well, including a lot of things that happened in the first quarter, record level compared to the last 5 years with weather losses, et cetera. But yes, there is a penalty there as well anytime we have new business.\nBrian Meredith: Okay. And then my second question, I'm just curious, if I adjust for the reserving actions taken in Personal Auto in the first quarter, I come up that you're kind of like a 94 combined ratio, ex those reserving actions still below the 96. I guess my question is, is it why are you having to tap the brakes right now given that you're kind of at a 94 ex those , which I'm assuming you're expecting not to happen here going forward?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, it's that balance, Brian, of our calendar year commitment and our lifetime cohort commitment. And so we're always thinking about the future, we're always trying to balance it. And I would say we're not putting on the brakes. We're definitely going to reduce our media spend, but our intentions are that we still want to grow. I just wanted to say that normally, when we reduce media, it could have anticipated slow growth.  Now John just mentioned, too, a lot of it depends on what's happening with competitors. We're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping. We're seeing -- we still see a very hard market. So our intentions are to get to our calendar year 96 and literally, as soon as we can, if we get to that, depending again on weather, regulatory things, et cetera, we can very easily ramp up our media spend to grow. So it's really that balance of accident year, calendar year commitments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Tricia, you cited overall severity up about 10%. So I'm trying to unpack the pieces. You cited the repair category being the most severe. Could you specify a number around that? And the second part of it is, I noticed the Manheim Index sequentially up 8.6% in the first quarter. So that was a big move. How are you thinking about used car prices as the year moves forward?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, a really good question. There's a lot that goes into the severity of fixing cars. And so a couple of things. We have really -- and I think as an industry, struggled with shop capacity. So our ability to get cars in the throughput to get them out, which could, of course, have effect on length of time, rental, et cetera. Parts prices are up, just a little bit under 3%, and labor rates. So think of the unemployment rate and how there's a problem kind of hiring everywhere. Same thing with mechanical techs in the body shops. But those repair rates are up between 4.5% and 5%. So that's some contributions. And then really, the parts prices, the cost of those haven't really abated either. So what we're really working to do our President of Claims is working with our body shop partners to open up capacity and get those cars in and out. And of course, weather exacerbates that as well. So we still haven't seen -- the Manheim went down a little bit. But again, it pops up and the high over the last several years is extraordinary. So that's kind of the trends we're reacting to. Again, the good part about this is these are short tailed. So we can react to them really quickly, which we have. And then we can continue to watch trends to determine have we taken enough rates for what we need now, in the future.\nAndrew Kligerman: I see. And you've mentioned non-rate actions, particularly for Commercial. And I think you may have touched on it in Personal. But given the non-rate actions have kind of been a part of the practice for the last couple of years. Is there really much leverage there non-rate actions?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. Yes. I would say there's a lot of leverage, especially on the Commercial side. And I won't go into all of what we're working on with restrictions on new business, et cetera. But yes, we're able to pretty quickly put those into play to make sure that the new business we're bringing on reach our target profit margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: So first, I had a question on advertising. And if you can talk about or quantify how much you're pulling back on advertising? And is it in specific regions? Or are you doing it throughout the country?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. We won't share exactly where we're pulling back, just like we don't share our budget and actually where our budget goes to whether it's mass media or digital. But I will say when we pull back on advertising, we have an incredible media book, and they will -- media group, and they will look at the most inefficient media and pull back accordingly. So that's something that we can dial up or down depending on what's happening with our profit margins. So -- but we won't share that. We can more easily turn local off if we need to, if we can't get right, et cetera. So that's kind of the approach we take to our media. We're really flexible and nimble as we've shown in the past.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then on the -- can you talk about the pricing environment and how conducive is the regulatory environment for adjusting prices? Because I think as companies are raising in the 2021 period, there was a lot of pushback from regulators. Is that -- is the price -- the regulatory environment better for price increases now than it was before? Or do you still expect pushback from regulators and delays in the process of raising prices?\nSusan Griffith: I think most of the regulators really do see and are watching these trends and it's not Progressive alone. It's definitely the industry seeing these inflationary trends continue. And so for the majority, as we show the data, they understand what we need for prospective rates. There's always going to be some challenges and we continue to have challenges. Like I said, if you take the 2 states on each coast that we always have a challenge with. But you know what, we're working with the departments of insurance to show and share our data and the need for it because in the long run, what we want to have is competitive prices. That's what makes our industry great, and we want to have available and affordable coverage for people in every state. So availability is really important. We know that. And so we're going to continue to work with the regulators to get that, but there's always a couple of states that could be challenging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Scott: First one I had is just on frequency trends. And I think they've run reasonably favorable for you all over the last 12 months and just how they've contributed to loss trend. So I just wanted to see if there was any sort of evolving view there and how that will play out and what you saw in 1Q, if you have any update?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean frequency in Q1 was relatively flat. We haven't quite seen it come back necessarily to solidly pre-COVID. It's really hard to flesh out frequency trends because there's still so many macroeconomic things that go into, we kind of just try to react to it. And there's always a little bit of noise in one quarter. So we'll continue to watch how frequency goes. Obviously, we have a lot of data from miles driven, vehicle miles traveled from our UBI data, so we watch for that. But that's something that we watch and react to, and there's a lot of inputs and a lot that we don't control.\nAlexander Scott: Understood. Okay. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on bodily injury severity. If you have any update, if you learned anything through 1Q on that front. It sounds like the decisions you're making in terms of the ad spend and growth and so forth in rate or more property damage severity driven, but I just wanted to make sure that there wasn't more of a bodily injury component to this.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. Bodily injury has started to be relatively stable over the last several quarters. Some of the severity increases we saw in Q1 had to do with our large losses, what we call , which is soft tissue, attorney rep, non-lit and some closing of soft tissue. So we're able to discern that pretty deeply and watch for that. And of course, obviously, those trends can change as well. But it's been fairly stable. And I think attorney rep levels are being -- are stabilized a little bit more too. And of course, I'll go to Florida because that could -- Florida is a big state, one of our biggest states, so that could change as well depending on how many losses we ultimately get based on House Bill 837.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nJon Newsome: A little bit of a follow-up. I was a little surprised not to hear commentary on distracted driving and faster driving being kind of an issue with the reserve issues. And it seems like it's all sort of pieces actually fixing things and the process of the shopping. Is that part of the equation as well? Or has that sort of stabilizes well?\nSusan Griffith: Well, it's hard to discern distracted driving solely on its own because we look at so many different variables. And obviously, we have a lot of data from our usage-based insurance from our snapshot to kind of understand the different variables. And there's a relatedness to that. So if you think about distracted driving and how it could relate to hard break. So it's not -- so we don't look at distracted driving only. So we were just talking before the call on how many more accidents we see. What we can react to, though, is the data where we -- is exactly what we're seeing in terms of accidents, frequency, vehicle mile travel, the congestion. So we look at all of that to understand what's happening and react to that. But I wouldn't say I would have any really further commentary specifically on distracted driving.\nJon Newsome: And then quite separately, can you talk a little bit about the Commercial business. It looked like the big picture that maybe it was all the same trends affecting private passenger auto, but that necessarily hasn't been in the past. So is that the case or all these kind of comments about where the reserve issues are and where the severity is happening in the Commercial business as well? Or is there a difference that's notable between the 2 businesses from a trend perspective?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. So our Commercial Lines, especially when you look at the reserving, is mostly in our core auto and very -- they're seeing very similar trends. And the trucking segment, those are expensive to fix as well. And from the perspective of reserving, we're seeing a little bit more late reports in our reps. Our case reserves are just strengthening from the rep perspective, but pretty similar trends.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Tricia, just on roughly 10 points of rate that you need to take, I think that's in addition to the 4 points that you already took this year, but correct me if I'm wrong on that. Could you just talk about how much of that is -- you had mentioned a catch up versus just what's needed to keep pace with trend?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. It was additional to the rate that we took in quarter 1. I won't go into actually talking exactly about what's catched up, et cetera, because we also look at rates perspectively, but we believe at this point with what we're seeing that, that will get us both of those. It will get us to the point where we are at our target profit margin eventually, hopefully, and rate to come to stay ahead of trend specifically.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And then just it sounds like you guys are still intending to grow and still feel pretty good about growth despite the lower ad spend. Am I right to interpret that when you think about how the rate adequacy you're not that far off on your existing -- on the existing prices out there and so you feel good about that dynamic?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, I do feel good about growth. And someone asked a question about underwriting scrutiny, and that's where you can really make sure that you gather more data to be more confident that the new business you're bringing on reaches your target profit margin. So we do feel comfortable with the growth, with the caveats of making sure that we do some extra scrutiny just to make sure that new business for the future is profitable. Pat, do you have anything to add?\nPatrick Callahan: Yes, just a little other color commentary on Q1's growth. So half of the incredible new business growth we had was from conversion improvements. And in the agency channel, it's more like 3/4. So when you talk about how competitive our prices are on the street, that's a pretty good indication that even with some media pullback, we will continue to have strong competitive rates and with higher levels of ambient shopping, feel pretty good about continuing to grow the business.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. What I always love to, and we've talked about this the other day in one of my meetings, is every time a situation like this happened and this has been such an incredibly volatile 3 years. When you pull back on advertising or expenses, you always learn something. So we try to take advantage of these times as well to learn something about our advertising and efficiency, et cetera. So we continue to do that as well, just as another comment.\nJohn Sauerland: David, on your question on catch-up versus forward looking. Our pricing is always forward-looking. And as we mentioned and Tricia's introductory comments, we clearly were a little off in terms of severities for fixing cars coming into the year. And that obviously was dialed into our indications. We've seen additional data points, as she mentioned, and we are dialing that into our future trend selects. There was also a discussion around Manheim. Our projections around Manheim, if you look back, for it to come down more aggressively than it has. It has been -- car pricing, in general, has stayed higher than we had anticipated a while back. That all goes into our future trend selects when we are doing our pricing indications. We've obviously dialed those up recently, and that's where we've arrived at the conclusion that we need to get more aggressive on rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Since higher severity and auto physical damage was a key driver behind adverse development in the quarter, can you reconcile how you got comfortable lowering your view of auto physical damage loss trend this quarter to 15% versus 20% last year?\nSusan Griffith: Well, I can give you a color of why we believe there's higher severity this quarter. And there's always a lot of noise in the quarter, but much of what you're seeing with the higher versus collision has to do with some older claims that are now working its way through our inbound subrogation. So if you think about claims at the height of ACV, et cetera, we're working through those. So that would be my point about the property damage severity trend. I'm not sure if I answered your question or...\nTracy Benguigui: Yes. In your Q or your K, you break out all the components, the loss trend. So within severity, I just noticed in the Q, auto physical damage was up 15%. I look at the 10-K, it was 20% last year, but directionally, it looks like it's down, doesn't seem to reconcile with the comments made earlier on the call and adverse development taken in the quarter. So I just wanted to understand why you took down your view of loss trend within auto physical damage?\nJohn Sauerland: Maybe a clarification. It's not our view of loss trend there. That is a retrospective looking number. So that is simply saying physical damage severity this quarter versus last year first quarter, similarly, when you looked at last year's numbers. So it is a consecutive retrospective metric. Does that help?\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And so would 20% even be the right number to think about for last year, given all the adverse development you've taken in that accident year or it's not correlated to given what you just said?\nJohn Sauerland: So each quarter we're providing you versus the previous period change in severity there. So we normally provide you the quarter and the year-to-date. And so right now, we're up 15% versus previous quarter for property damage. So you mentioned physical damage. Property damages the third-party coverage for fixing cars.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: If we go back 2 years ago to this conference call after the 1Q '21 10-Q, you announced that you were taking rate. And when we saw May 2021 results, growth had just ground to a halt. You had very little regulatory approval at that point, very little premium written or earned at the new rates. And you were able to stop the growth almost immediately. What were some of the skills that you had that you were able to do that before you had even taken the rate? And what aren't you going to do this time compared to the urgency that you were able to stop the growth in 2021?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. We're going to use the similar levers, and that's why I tried to answer in my opening question-and-answer session. At that point, regulators -- we were ahead of the curve, ahead of the competition. So regulators were still, I think, worried about the effects of the people giving us back with the COVID, et cetera, which I'm very proud of all that we did with that, but very similar levers that we used last time. I think also what we're seeing now, though, is that it's a very hard market. So I think both Pat and John talked about the rate increases that our competitors are taking, which is still causing some shopping.  So even though we'll use similar levers, we've been able to grow, like I gave you some of the stats first quarter. And so we believe that, that may continue depending again on what competition does. I think regulators started seeing way more companies come in with very similar data, and they know that if they want to have available coverage for their constituents that we have to put this through the system. It's just -- it's the bottom line, what we're seeing from an inflationary trend.\nJoshua Shanker: All right. And then in the 10-Q, you mentioned that the current year impact of HB 837 was less than 100 basis points on the quarter. Can I extrapolate that it was 200 or 300 basis points for the month of March?\nSusan Griffith: Yes, you probably could. I haven't really done the math on that. But what we did is we looked at -- we looked at what we thought would be probable and estimable based on the thought of lawsuits that happened in a short period of time before the bill was signed. And again, that could evolve because some of those things may or may not actually happen. But yes, that math is probably pretty accurate. And again, that's something that will continue to evolve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: My first question, looking at just the tremendous growth we've seen quarter-to-date, can you maybe talk about the weighting of Sam's, Diane's, Wrights, Robinsons among those customers that were added? And even among new applications, like are those roughly -- is that distribution roughly in line with what you have in the in-force book?\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think we're out in the queue. Pat or John can weigh in on this. I think we grew in all segments. I think we've -- I think we've increased in Robinsons from an auto home bundle. Sam's are going to be more likely to continue to shop. So there's always the PLE part of that. But I think we grew against all segments.\nPatrick Callahan: Yes, that's right. From an app perspective, we saw positive growth in the quarter for new apps across all segments. And our fastest growth was really in the Wright and Robinsons and Diane's also grew. So Sam's grew just a little slower, but they grew as well. From a PIF perspective, we also saw positive growth across all segments during the quarter. So faster in the segments that are not Sam's, but...\nJohn Sauerland: And just for those unfamiliar with our nomenclature, Wrights are homeowners who don't bundle with us. So Robinsons as well known, I think, by this audience. Wrights are homeowners who have their auto insurance, perhaps some other products with this as well. And that's where we've actually grown the fastest. And in the agency channel, especially where we are limited to our -- what we think of as our manufacturer or underwritten property product, Progressive Home, we have been pulling back in a number of markets to revise our geographic footprint. And it's encouraging to see that we are still growing with home-owning households, even though in a lot of markets where we're restricting the property piece of that portfolio. So we're still growing in Robinsons as well as Pat pointed out. And Diane's are what we think of as renters who are stable in their insuring habits. So growing more in the more stable sectors and growing homeowners considerably even without the bundle, which is also encouraging to see.\nYaron Kinar: And then my next question, I guess, goes back to I think several other versions of this question that were asked on the call already. And I'm just looking at comments coming into my e-mail over the course of this call. It seems like there is still some lingering investor confusion around what I would say maybe is the sense of urgency and aggressiveness coming from you talking about kind of the need to take some corrective actions. And the year-to-date data that we're seeing, mainly 95-ish combined ratio when we take out some of the reserve adjustments that we assume will not go forward. So I was hoping to maybe take another stab at that will give you another opportunity to maybe clarify some of that confusion.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. It's really all about our calendar year goal. So -- we appreciate the fact that we will look at our long-term growth as long as well as our short-term growth. But we've had a very long stated goal for long-term holders, for our investment community that we will do everything we can to treat our calendar year 96. And we're not there. We're at 99. And so that's why we're taking aggressive actions. The great part is we have lots of levers that we can quickly move. And our nimbleness, specifically here Progressive will be the benefit. So if things turn around dramatically in the next 4 months, again, the caveats are regulatory approval, weather, inflationary trends, we'll be able to put on growth. But also -- and that's why I gave those stats at the beginning. The growth has been unbelievable, and we don't think it's going to come to a screeching halt. We know that there's a relationship between advertising and new business apps we're still feeling positive.  So I hope my letter, the queue and my comments didn't say this growth is going to come to a screeching halt. What I wanted to do is just say, hey, that can very well happen when we reduce advertising and always has in the past. To what degree is very dependent on all those things, including competition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: I noticed policy life expectancies trended positively in the quarter. Just hoping you could help us understand what goes into that metric? And how should we think about that trending now that you're raising prices again and have added a lot of new customers?\nSusan Griffith: Well, it traded positive on a trailing 3. It's still down on a trailing 12. We think trailing 3 is more indicative of what's happening. Again, that may and could change depending on the rate increases. That's usually what we see happen. The PLE is just our likelihood for our customer, the length of time our customers are likely to stay. So the trailing 3 is pretty -- is more recent activity. We'll have to continue to watch that trend to see if any of our rate actions affect that negatively.\nMichael Ward: And then on the investment portfolio. I was just hoping you could provide some color on the strategy in CMBS. I know there's new disclosure in the queue. Just specifically curious why you guys favor single properties, CMBS, especially office. I'm wondering if you could sort of comment on the sales that you mentioned in the Q thus far?\nSusan Griffith: Absolutely. I'll have Jon Bauer weigh in. But I will say from -- we added the chart in on the Q for CMBS this year. And I'll say that Jon was ahead of the curve in terms of starting to reduce our risk in CMBS over a year ago. But I'll let him walk through why he did that and where we're headed from here. Jon?\nJonathan Bauer: Yes. Thanks so much for the question, Michael. So just to take a step back, and then I'll try to hit it as specifically as possible. About first quarter 2022, when we looked at the portfolio, and we looked at the overall macro environment, we saw that the portfolio we came into early 2022, which didn't match our macro views going forward. So several actions that we look to take at that point.  So first of all, on the interest rate side, we sort of ended January around 3 and then 8s on our interest rate duration. We thought that was too high given the environment. So we allowed that to shift down throughout the year to about the $275 million by October and then look to move that back up again to 3. On the equity side, we thought, overall, given what the actions were likely to be that equities were likely to see more volatility than we have seen in the past and therefore, look to reduce our equity exposure pretty much cut in half to what we are right now. And then we looked across our non-sort of cash and treasury fixed income portfolio and said, if we hit a recession, where is it that we think that we would be most uncomfortable. And the 3 areas that we sort of identified to watch and that we wanted to hold taking any further credit risk was residential mortgage-backed securities, CLOs and commercial mortgage-backed securities. I would say, in the 12 months since then, as many of you witnessed, the housing market has probably performed better than many thought. And the same has been true within our residential mortgage-backed securities. So we even though that shrunk as a portion of our portfolio, we think the housing market is better than we thought.  In terms of CLOs, I would say it's still to be determined what the corporate default rate looks like going forward, but feel very comfortable with our position there, even though it's smaller versus last year. And then that takes us to commercial mortgage-backed securities. In that portfolio as opposed to just not adding and allowing the runoff to happen, we prospectively looked at the portfolio and said, if we were to hit a recession, which are the securities in here that we think in a severe recession could get hit. And with that, we looked over the last year to reduce out of those securities. And as you can see, year-on-year, CMBS represented about 13% of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter 2022, it represents less than 8% of the portfolio right now. So what encompasses that we felt like we wanted to give the disclosure.  On the office side, 2 major drivers of that portfolio. The first thing is trophy office. So these are offices that were built in the last 10 years or so, that our view was -- would have significant demand, especially as different companies look to shrink their footprint, but look to be in the best quality buildings. And then the second part of the portfolio is if it's not trophy office, we would want it at least 4 to 5 years past maturity to an incredibly strong investment-grade tenant.  And so that makes up the core of the portfolio with a single asset portfolio, it allows us to look and pick individual buildings that we would underwrite as opposed to a conduit type thing, where you have a lot of different type of quality of buildings that we think are a lot lesser than they are on the single asset side.  So with that, and as we mentioned, the disclosure, we have no delinquencies in the portfolio. We have about $350 million of maturities over the next year in the overall CMBS portfolio, and we expect them, even in this type of environment, all to be refinanced without a problem. I don't know if that answers your question, but please let me know if I could give you any more specifics.\nMichael Ward: Yes. No, that was tremendously helpful. Maybe just on what you shedded recently, recent quarters, did you trim California, Seattle?\nJonathan Bauer: Yes. So I would take it a lot more broadly than that. Again, for us, and I would -- since we have the opportunity to talk here, I would say this across our portfolio, not just in commercial real estate. What we are constantly doing is looking and saying, are we getting paid for the risk that we're taking in the security or that one? For CMBS in particular, it was the first thing going back to February, March of last year, is there any tenant rollover where we think this building could be vacant coming into their maturities. So get rid of that one. Is there any buildings where we don't think the owners are going to put the money into the building in order to get it to the quality, to lease up, get rid of that one. And so what that left us with broadly across the portfolio was trophy real estate and then ones that have really strong tenancy, 5 years or longer past the maturity.  So I wouldn't focus geography. By geography necessarily, I'm more on what's the quality of the building, what's the quality of the tenancy. And I think that's what left us with the portfolio with no delinquencies where we feel confident in the next 12 months of maturities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Yes. Just a couple here. So I guess the first question, on the 10 points of rate. So when we go back like a year ago, I think it was on this call, where you guys said you were done taking outsized rate increases. I guess since then, you guys never stopped taking rate increases. I think since then, you've gotten like 9 points in the aggregate, so I guess when I think about like this extra 10 points that you're saying you need over the next 3 quarters and thinking about the fact that you've actually taken almost that much like in the trailing 4 quarters, it really just doesn't seem like that much of a step-up versus what we're seeing. But yes, just your comments on whether or not I'm thinking about that correctly.\nSusan Griffith: Yes. I mean what we prefer to do is, obviously, we want to be ahead of the rates to achieve our target profit margins. We prefer to take small bites to the apple, which we did in first quarter, but then we saw the data change dramatically. And so for our future rate need, we believe at this point that around 10 rates is sort of the neighborhood of what we'll need on the private passenger auto side. So I think you're thinking about it. Okay. I mean what we said in the quarter is that we thought the largest rate increases were behind us, but this has been a really volatile time. And so we're just reacting to what we're seeing right now.\nJohn Sauerland: Right. I would just add that over...\nSusan Griffith: John wanted to add a comment.\nJohn Sauerland: I was just going to say, over time, we have been very well served, analyzing the data very expeditiously and taking action as we see changes. So as Tricia mentioned, if things don't play out in terms of loss trend as we are expecting, we can always pull back. We can always even take rates down. I would be surprised if we do that, but we can certainly pull back. But continually, we find we are way better off looking at the data every single month. And to the extent we think things have changed taking action expeditiously.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I've got a couple of questions on just whether or not there might be like some adverse selection going on. If you could just comment on like where you're seeing the loss trend, the issues in the book? Is it -- would you say it's disproportionately toward the new business that you put on? Or are you kind of talking about that broadly across the book?\nSusan Griffith: No. I mean I think where adverse selection comes into place specifically is for those companies that have industry-leading segmentation. And we believe we have that. We believe we have that with our variables, with our UBI, et cetera. So we actually feel good that we talked a little bit about the underlying loss cost. We feel pretty good about that. There's just some trends that we're seeing that we need to get ahead of. So our goal, of course, is to rate accurately and be aggressive in getting the right rate at the right time on the street. And if you do that and you have segmentation like we do, adverse selection should happen, but not to us.\nPatrick Callahan: Yes. The only thing I would add is -- the only thing I would add on the mix of business that we're getting in the quality is to the contrary, we feel very good about the quality of business we put on during fourth quarter and first quarter. We're constantly paranoid. We always watch and we look closely to ensure that the mix that's being shed by our competitors as they transfer market share to us, we watch closely, and we are seeing clean business. We're seeing homeowner business, as John mentioned, long prior insurance periods, multi-car. So it's exactly the business that we intend to grow with, and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing contrary to any adverse selection.\nDouglas Constantine: We've exhausted our scheduled time and so that concludes our event forum. I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "Mike, the one point I'd add on that is, we don't live in a vacuum, obviously. And our actions I would say, all else equal, will certainly adversely affect growth, less advertising dollars, higher rates for sure. But as we saw last year, as the competitive marketplace was in a bit of disarray even with our aggressive actions, we saw growth. So it will remain to be seen what our competitors do in this environment that we are currently experiencing and if they react aggressively as well, then obviously, our growth won't be as adversely affected. David, on your question on catch-up versus forward looking. Our pricing is always forward-looking. And as we mentioned and Tricia's introductory comments, we clearly were a little off in terms of severities for fixing cars coming into the year. And that obviously was dialed into our indications. We've seen additional data points, as she mentioned, and we are dialing that into our future trend selects. There was also a discussion around Manheim. Our projections around Manheim, if you look back, for it to come down more aggressively than it has. It has been -- car pricing, in general, has stayed higher than we had anticipated a while back. That all goes into our future trend selects when we are doing our pricing indications. We've obviously dialed those up recently, and that's where we've arrived at the conclusion that we need to get more aggressive on rate. Maybe a clarification. It's not our view of loss trend there. That is a retrospective looking number. So that is simply saying physical damage severity this quarter versus last year first quarter, similarly, when you looked at last year's numbers. So it is a consecutive retrospective metric. Does that help? So each quarter we're providing you versus the previous period change in severity there. So we normally provide you the quarter and the year-to-date. And so right now, we're up 15% versus previous quarter for property damage. So you mentioned physical damage. Property damages the third-party coverage for fixing cars. And just for those unfamiliar with our nomenclature, Wrights are homeowners who don't bundle with us. So Robinsons as well known, I think, by this audience. Wrights are homeowners who have their auto insurance, perhaps some other products with this as well. And that's where we've actually grown the fastest.

            "name": "Susan Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. One of the enduring lessons since the onset of the pandemic is the uncertainty of the future. Since March 2020, the world and our business have been pummeled by unforeseen events. In that vein is perhaps poetic that 3 years post pandemic, we continue to have to manage through the unexpected in our business. In the end, I'm confident that our resilience will see us through.  Through the first quarter, we're not on track to achieve our calendar year goal of a 96 combined ratio. Given our extensive history of meeting our stated goals, this has prompted many questions about how we got here and where we're going. As such, in lieu of a more traditional opening statement, I'll instead provide answers to some questions that have been asked by the investment analysts. My hope is that you will gain a clear understanding of how we are addressing the challenges as well as the urgency with which we are acting. The first question is, how are you reacting to being above your target of a 96 calendar year combined ratio. The answer to that is we will react to the same way we always have with speed and decisiveness. The 3 largest levers we have to manage our margin are to decrease our expense ratio, tighten our verification and underwriting scrutiny of new business and increased rates. I'll address these in that order. Our largest controllable variable expense is advertising spend, and we are taking action to reduce these costs, which we expect could both slow growth and help to reduce our expense ratio. Once we are confident that we can deliver our target calendar year profitability, we will consider resuming our spend. While we won't provide details on which segments of media we are reducing or how this may affect growth going forward, I will tell you that we've invested in bringing the same industry-leading science from the pricing side of our business to the acquisition side, and we'll continue to spend in the places that we believe have the greatest benefit to the business. Using non-rate actions such as tighter verification and underwriting standards and limiting bill plan options, will reduce our growth in the segments we believe we can't currently write at our target margins.  Finally, our largest and slowest moving lever is rates. In quarter 1, we took 4 points of rate in Personal Auto on an aggregate country-wide basis, and we are still earning in some of the prior year rate increases. We plan to take aggressive rate increases where needed across all lines through the balance of 2023 to ensure we're pricing to deliver our target profit margin. The next question, given the actions we will take to meet our profit target is, what will this do to growth? First and foremost, keep in mind that growth in the first quarter of 2023 was an all-time high for the company, and we are very proud of that. Secondly, we are still in a very hard market with lots of consumers quoting their insurance. We also continue to see ambient shopping. While policy growth may be slowed by our actions, we still anticipate there will continue to be robust demand for our products. Of course, the actions of our competitors also play a role in what growth will be. So I won't speculate on specific growth predictions. However, you can rest assured that we are focused on growing policies that we believe will meet or exceed our target margins. Lastly, we've received many questions like this one. Do you now believe your reserving is adequate? Or said another way, you said that you were confident that the biggest rate increases were behind you, what changed? The answer is fairly basic. We started seeing data come in over the last few months that was not in line with what we were anticipating, which caused us to increase reserves and react with rate increases.  In Personal Lines, our reserve strengthening happened largely in the short-tailed fixing vehicle coverages. In these coverages, we can recognize and react to new trends relatively quickly, and we feel good about our reserve levels today. That being said, reserves are estimates and change over time based on evolving trends. As for the effects of Florida House Bill 837. In March, we estimated the reserve changes we believe we needed to capture the effect of the legislation, including the flood of lawsuits triggered by the law change. The reserve increases we took in March represented our best estimate of what we believe would be the full effect of the lawsuits on loss costs for prebill accident periods. Going forward, we believe the legislation takes positive steps to help manage the cost of auto insurance for Florida consumers. However, the situation is evolving, and we will continue to assess and react to information as it develops. In Commercial Lines, again, we believe we are adequately reserved today and are monitoring trends in frequency and severity to ensure we remain adequately reserved. Of course, any assumption on reserve adequacy comes with a caveat that trends can change. If they do, we will react to them as appropriate. The follow-up to the reserving adequacy question is, how did you miss reserving trends in the recent past? And given that, how can you be confident in your current reserve adequacy? I'll address these questions individually. The business of insurance is predicting the future. We never know our full cost of goods sold until years after premiums are collected. As such, our reserves are, by nature, estimates of our exposures based on assumptions. We use historical data, extensive knowledge about our business and customers and advanced analytics to predict ultimate loss costs usually with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Predicting the future is hard, however, and we didn't fully predict trends that developed during the quarter. We saw higher-than-expected severity trends in previously closed claims in Personal Auto, primarily in fixing vehicle coverages. While I won't speculate on why these trends change, I can tell you that we reacted quickly and decisively to adjust our reserves for these short-tail coverages. I'm confident in the people and processes we have in place to ensure we're adequately reserved.  For the 5 years ending 2022, prior year reserve development averaged about 0.25 points unfavorable on our year-end combined ratio, which I believe supports the statement that we always strive to set reserves adequately. Hopefully, these questions and answers address some of the most sought-after explanations of the first quarter. Rest assured that no one is more acutely aware of the results of the first quarter than myself, my team and all the people at Progressive. I continue to be confident in the long-term direction we're headed, and I a little doubt will continue to do everything we can to achieve our goals. Thank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions. Good question, Mike, thanks. So we think the long-term effects of the legislation as it's written today would be very positive for the consumers of Florida. In the meantime, we're very familiar with the plaintiff bar, and we don't know that they will not try to challenge those. So what we did in March was we took a look at the fact that more lawsuits were being filed. And every time we consider our cost we look at, is it estimable and probable. And that's why we strengthened the reserve for possible and likely lawsuits that are going to occur between the time that the governor talked about the legislative bill and the time that he signed it.  In fact, in March, there were 280,000 lawsuits filed in Florida, not ours, overall in Florida, civil lawsuits, which is up nearly 130%, the all-time high of May 2021. So significant lawsuits. So short term, we are going to prepare to obviously get through those long term, this will be good. So a couple of good things that came out of the House Bill 837. Comparative laws changed from pure to modify comparatives. So if you're greater than 50%, you don't collect. The statute limitations is from 4 years to 2 years. There's a safe harbor for bad faith, which is really important to us because it takes some time when you get into claim to actually gather the information to make to actually start to negotiate if there's a demand and probably most importantly, repealing one way attorney fees. There's a little bit more than that, but we think those are really good.  In the short term, though, we -- this could evolve, and we don't know if it will be challenged. And so we will just react accordingly as we have more information. But overall, we feel very good about the law changes, and we think it's really good more importantly for the consumers of Florida. Yes. I mean I think at any time you reduce advertising, the likelihood of growth on subsiding a little bit is going to happen. We see that in our data. And we have seen our competitors take rate compared to us and even more so -- even more than us. So the hard market really has to do with our people shopping, and they are. So we do feel still bullish on our growth. Let me give you a couple of key stats because I didn't talk about those. I talked a little bit about the new apps, which were tremendous in the all-time history of the company. But let me give you a couple of other interesting stats that we feel really incredible about.  So this quarter, we grew policies in force $1.4 million. We grew premium $2.6 billion, which is approximately like 1 point of market share. If you look at even like a 12-month span, we've grown more than $5 billion. And if you think about that, that's the size of a top 10 carrier. So those are a couple I think, interesting an extraordinary tidbits that we feel good about. Also, when you look at growth, you're going to look at both unit growth and premium growth. So maybe unit growth subsides a little bit, we really don't know. We just know that sometimes when you reduce advertising, when you increase advertising, there's the inverse relationship. But there's also premium growth. So as we take more rate to get to our target profit margin, you're going to see some premium growth. And ultimately, our goal is that you'll also see our margins widen. Sure. I assume that would come up when I didn't give a number. we're going to take as much rate as we need to try to get to our target profit margin. I believe what we've shown, not just over this inflationary period, but over decades with Progressive, that we execute on our ability to do that. We have a great pricing group, a great rate revision group. So we know we can do that. Now there's all the caveats of regulatory approval, what can happen with weather, which could increase or decrease our desire to have more rates. And of course, it's very specific state, channel product, et cetera. What I would say at this point in time, and again, all the caveats that this is really quite a dynamic time. We think we'll take in the neighborhood of around 10 more points this year to catch up and stay ahead of trend in private passenger auto. So low single digits. But again, that could be 8% to 12%. We don't know. Right now, that's our plan as of today. We're watching as things unfold. Yes. From an auto perspective, we always want to grow as fast as we can, but we are limited sometimes with the regulatory approvals. So obviously, there are places where we haven't got as much rate as we've needed, think the Coast, which we've talked about before, going to need more on those because we've been waiting for some rate increases in some of those states. Some are less where we feel like we're ahead of it. We don't really want to go into details, but suffice it to say, on a country-wide average, we think in the neighborhood about 10% additional this year. Well, I think in this quarter, our media expense was up, so you're going to feel that especially on the direct side since we front-load those costs. So I think I said this in the last call. I sort of look at new business penalty as an investment in our future and having our future policyholders. But you did see a higher expense ratio, and we were -- we still had our pedal on for media spend in that first -- in the first quarter this year. So yes, expenses were higher. Yes, yes, new business does carry a higher loss ratio. That was part of it as well, including a lot of things that happened in the first quarter, record level compared to the last 5 years with weather losses, et cetera. But yes, there is a penalty there as well anytime we have new business. Yes, it's that balance, Brian, of our calendar year commitment and our lifetime cohort commitment. And so we're always thinking about the future, we're always trying to balance it. And I would say we're not putting on the brakes. We're definitely going to reduce our media spend, but our intentions are that we still want to grow. I just wanted to say that normally, when we reduce media, it could have anticipated slow growth.  Now John just mentioned, too, a lot of it depends on what's happening with competitors. We're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping. We're seeing -- we still see a very hard market. So our intentions are to get to our calendar year 96 and literally, as soon as we can, if we get to that, depending again on weather, regulatory things, et cetera, we can very easily ramp up our media spend to grow. So it's really that balance of accident year, calendar year commitments. Yes, a really good question. There's a lot that goes into the severity of fixing cars. And so a couple of things. We have really -- and I think as an industry, struggled with shop capacity. So our ability to get cars in the throughput to get them out, which could, of course, have effect on length of time, rental, et cetera. Parts prices are up, just a little bit under 3%, and labor rates. So think of the unemployment rate and how there's a problem kind of hiring everywhere. Same thing with mechanical techs in the body shops. But those repair rates are up between 4.5% and 5%. So that's some contributions. And then really, the parts prices, the cost of those haven't really abated either. So what we're really working to do our President of Claims is working with our body shop partners to open up capacity and get those cars in and out. And of course, weather exacerbates that as well. So we still haven't seen -- the Manheim went down a little bit. But again, it pops up and the high over the last several years is extraordinary. So that's kind of the trends we're reacting to. Again, the good part about this is these are short tailed. So we can react to them really quickly, which we have. And then we can continue to watch trends to determine have we taken enough rates for what we need now, in the future. Yes. Yes. I would say there's a lot of leverage, especially on the Commercial side. And I won't go into all of what we're working on with restrictions on new business, et cetera. But yes, we're able to pretty quickly put those into play to make sure that the new business we're bringing on reach our target profit margins. Yes. We won't share exactly where we're pulling back, just like we don't share our budget and actually where our budget goes to whether it's mass media or digital. But I will say when we pull back on advertising, we have an incredible media book, and they will -- media group, and they will look at the most inefficient media and pull back accordingly. So that's something that we can dial up or down depending on what's happening with our profit margins. So -- but we won't share that. We can more easily turn local off if we need to, if we can't get right, et cetera. So that's kind of the approach we take to our media. We're really flexible and nimble as we've shown in the past. I think most of the regulators really do see and are watching these trends and it's not Progressive alone. It's definitely the industry seeing these inflationary trends continue. And so for the majority, as we show the data, they understand what we need for prospective rates. There's always going to be some challenges and we continue to have challenges. Like I said, if you take the 2 states on each coast that we always have a challenge with. But you know what, we're working with the departments of insurance to show and share our data and the need for it because in the long run, what we want to have is competitive prices. That's what makes our industry great, and we want to have available and affordable coverage for people in every state. So availability is really important. We know that. And so we're going to continue to work with the regulators to get that, but there's always a couple of states that could be challenging. Yes. I mean frequency in Q1 was relatively flat. We haven't quite seen it come back necessarily to solidly pre-COVID. It's really hard to flesh out frequency trends because there's still so many macroeconomic things that go into, we kind of just try to react to it. And there's always a little bit of noise in one quarter. So we'll continue to watch how frequency goes. Obviously, we have a lot of data from miles driven, vehicle miles traveled from our UBI data, so we watch for that. But that's something that we watch and react to, and there's a lot of inputs and a lot that we don't control. Yes. Bodily injury has started to be relatively stable over the last several quarters. Some of the severity increases we saw in Q1 had to do with our large losses, what we call , which is soft tissue, attorney rep, non-lit and some closing of soft tissue. So we're able to discern that pretty deeply and watch for that. And of course, obviously, those trends can change as well. But it's been fairly stable. And I think attorney rep levels are being -- are stabilized a little bit more too. And of course, I'll go to Florida because that could -- Florida is a big state, one of our biggest states, so that could change as well depending on how many losses we ultimately get based on House Bill 837. Well, it's hard to discern distracted driving solely on its own because we look at so many different variables. And obviously, we have a lot of data from our usage-based insurance from our snapshot to kind of understand the different variables. And there's a relatedness to that. So if you think about distracted driving and how it could relate to hard break. So it's not -- so we don't look at distracted driving only. So we were just talking before the call on how many more accidents we see. What we can react to, though, is the data where we -- is exactly what we're seeing in terms of accidents, frequency, vehicle mile travel, the congestion. So we look at all of that to understand what's happening and react to that. But I wouldn't say I would have any really further commentary specifically on distracted driving. Yes. So our Commercial Lines, especially when you look at the reserving, is mostly in our core auto and very -- they're seeing very similar trends. And the trucking segment, those are expensive to fix as well. And from the perspective of reserving, we're seeing a little bit more late reports in our reps. Our case reserves are just strengthening from the rep perspective, but pretty similar trends. Yes. It was additional to the rate that we took in quarter 1. I won't go into actually talking exactly about what's catched up, et cetera, because we also look at rates perspectively, but we believe at this point with what we're seeing that, that will get us both of those. It will get us to the point where we are at our target profit margin eventually, hopefully, and rate to come to stay ahead of trend specifically. Yes, I do feel good about growth. And someone asked a question about underwriting scrutiny, and that's where you can really make sure that you gather more data to be more confident that the new business you're bringing on reaches your target profit margin. So we do feel comfortable with the growth, with the caveats of making sure that we do some extra scrutiny just to make sure that new business for the future is profitable. Pat, do you have anything to add? Yes. What I always love to, and we've talked about this the other day in one of my meetings, is every time a situation like this happened and this has been such an incredibly volatile 3 years. When you pull back on advertising or expenses, you always learn something. So we try to take advantage of these times as well to learn something about our advertising and efficiency, et cetera. So we continue to do that as well, just as another comment. Well, I can give you a color of why we believe there's higher severity this quarter. And there's always a lot of noise in the quarter, but much of what you're seeing with the higher versus collision has to do with some older claims that are now working its way through our inbound subrogation. So if you think about claims at the height of ACV, et cetera, we're working through those. So that would be my point about the property damage severity trend. I'm not sure if I answered your question or... Yes. We're going to use the similar levers, and that's why I tried to answer in my opening question-and-answer session. At that point, regulators -- we were ahead of the curve, ahead of the competition. So regulators were still, I think, worried about the effects of the people giving us back with the COVID, et cetera, which I'm very proud of all that we did with that, but very similar levers that we used last time. I think also what we're seeing now, though, is that it's a very hard market. So I think both Pat and John talked about the rate increases that our competitors are taking, which is still causing some shopping.  So even though we'll use similar levers, we've been able to grow, like I gave you some of the stats first quarter. And so we believe that, that may continue depending again on what competition does. I think regulators started seeing way more companies come in with very similar data, and they know that if they want to have available coverage for their constituents that we have to put this through the system. It's just -- it's the bottom line, what we're seeing from an inflationary trend. Yes, you probably could. I haven't really done the math on that. But what we did is we looked at -- we looked at what we thought would be probable and estimable based on the thought of lawsuits that happened in a short period of time before the bill was signed. And again, that could evolve because some of those things may or may not actually happen. But yes, that math is probably pretty accurate. And again, that's something that will continue to evolve. Yes. I think we're out in the queue. Pat or John can weigh in on this. I think we grew in all segments. I think we've -- I think we've increased in Robinsons from an auto home bundle. Sam's are going to be more likely to continue to shop. So there's always the PLE part of that. But I think we grew against all segments. Yes. It's really all about our calendar year goal. So -- we appreciate the fact that we will look at our long-term growth as long as well as our short-term growth. But we've had a very long stated goal for long-term holders, for our investment community that we will do everything we can to treat our calendar year 96. And we're not there. We're at 99. And so that's why we're taking aggressive actions. The great part is we have lots of levers that we can quickly move. And our nimbleness, specifically here Progressive will be the benefit. So if things turn around dramatically in the next 4 months, again, the caveats are regulatory approval, weather, inflationary trends, we'll be able to put on growth. But also -- and that's why I gave those stats at the beginning. The growth has been unbelievable, and we don't think it's going to come to a screeching halt. We know that there's a relationship between advertising and new business apps we're still feeling positive.  So I hope my letter, the queue and my comments didn't say this growth is going to come to a screeching halt. What I wanted to do is just say, hey, that can very well happen when we reduce advertising and always has in the past. To what degree is very dependent on all those things, including competition. Well, it traded positive on a trailing 3. It's still down on a trailing 12. We think trailing 3 is more indicative of what's happening. Again, that may and could change depending on the rate increases. That's usually what we see happen. The PLE is just our likelihood for our customer, the length of time our customers are likely to stay. So the trailing 3 is pretty -- is more recent activity. We'll have to continue to watch that trend to see if any of our rate actions affect that negatively. Absolutely. I'll have Jon Bauer weigh in. But I will say from -- we added the chart in on the Q for CMBS this year. And I'll say that Jon was ahead of the curve in terms of starting to reduce our risk in CMBS over a year ago. But I'll let him walk through why he did that and where we're headed from here. Jon? Yes. I mean what we prefer to do is, obviously, we want to be ahead of the rates to achieve our target profit margins. We prefer to take small bites to the apple, which we did in first quarter, but then we saw the data change dramatically. And so for our future rate need, we believe at this point that around 10 rates is sort of the neighborhood of what we'll need on the private passenger auto side. So I think you're thinking about it. Okay. I mean what we said in the quarter is that we thought the largest rate increases were behind us, but this has been a really volatile time. And so we're just reacting to what we're seeing right now. John wanted to add a comment. No. I mean I think where adverse selection comes into place specifically is for those companies that have industry-leading segmentation. And we believe we have that. We believe we have that with our variables, with our UBI, et cetera. So we actually feel good that we talked a little bit about the underlying loss cost. We feel pretty good about that. There's just some trends that we're seeing that we need to get ahead of. So our goal, of course, is to rate accurately and be aggressive in getting the right rate at the right time on the street. And if you do that and you have segmentation like we do, adverse selection should happen, but not to us."

        "content": "Doug Constantine: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for Progressive\u2019s First (sic) [Third] Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s event. The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company\u2019s website. Although our quarterly investor relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today\u2019s event for introductory comments by our CEO, and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions-and-answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today\u2019s event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, Safe Harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\nTricia Griffith: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to begin today by extending my sympathies to those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The scenes of destruction were truly heart-wrenching and the human toll of these storms was devastating. As the cleanup efforts continue, I\u2019m heartened to know that Progressive\u2019s excellent claim staff is standing by to assist our customers in their greatest time of need. In fact, I\u2019ve heard countless versions of stories like the one I\u2019m about to share with you. This is when our customers need us most, and when we shine the brightest. My name is Anne-Marie and my fiance is Timothy. We just lost our RV with this last Hurricane Helene. I\u2019ve been in Tampa for two months sitting by Timothy\u2019s bedside while he fought cancer. I\u2019m happy to say that he is in remission. I came back to Fort Myers Beach to meet with the adjuster, Ray. I would like to tell you about my encounter with this lovely gentleman. Ray was prompt, professional and showed compassion for my loss of our home. He is the perfect person to be assessing the damages of one\u2019s property. I cannot say enough positive things about Ray. He is one of a kind and it was a pleasure to meet under these horrible circumstances. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. To my clients\u2019 colleagues, you amaze me every day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you do each and every day. Turning towards results. The third quarter was one of our strongest in our history. Across our businesses, we added almost 1.6 million policies in force, the most we\u2019ve ever added in a quarter. This brings the total policies added this year to nearly 4.2 million, truly a remarkable feat. The magnitude of this growth during the year requires increases in sales, servicing and claim staffing, and our teams have met the challenge, enabling us to maximize growth while providing the quality experience our customers expect of us. Throughout the third quarter, we experienced very strong demand for our Personal Lines products across both channels. While direct channel new application growth responded almost immediately to our increase in media spend and the release of non-rate actions earlier in the year, as evidenced by the channel\u2019s stronger new business growth in Q2, the agency channel\u2019s growth potential wasn\u2019t fully realized until the last few weeks of the second quarter. The result is a third quarter where our growth machine was firing on all cylinders with clear results in both channels experiencing record levels of new applications. To-date, the level of ambient shopping and Personal Auto remains very high, ambient capitalized on that. In Q3 2024, we spent more on media than in any quarter in our history. The result was a higher number of direct channel prospects than any quarter in our history, surpassing Q2 2024, the previous record holder. Additionally, conversion is strong, suggesting that we are well-priced compared to the competition. Though the fourth quarter, especially November and December, are historically lower in sales volume, we believe that we can continue to position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of prospects from the marketplace. The record growth is even more impressive when you consider our profit margins. Our year-to-date combined ratio through Q3 was very strong. Though the cost of Hurricane Milton are not reflected in our Q3 numbers, 2024 is still shaping up to be one of the best non-pandemic years in our history. Growing at our pace with record profits is a testament to the investment we\u2019ve made in segmentation over the years and we\u2019re not standing still. Our newest product model, which continues to add further segmentation in our Personal Auto products, is available in states that represent about one-third of our net written premium. You\u2019ll recall that in 2022 and 2023, the Commercial Auto market was impacted by many of the same inflationary pressures as Personal Lines. In response to the rising loss costs, we took double-digit rate increases in 2023. In Q3 2024, we reported our third straight quarter of quarter-over-quarter improvement in our loss and LAE ratio for Commercial Lines. Our results in part from the rate we took in 2023, earning in, which is a slower process in Commercial Lines, since the majority of our policies are 12 months. Growth has been more difficult in that line as the softness in the truck market has offset solid growth in our other non-trucking business market targets. As our competitors catch up in rate, however, we are optimistic that we\u2019re well-positioned for more growth in the future. The third quarter results in Property were excellent at a 78.5 combined ratio, after almost 30 points of favorable development on storms from the first half of the year, and despite the 21 points of losses incurred by Hurricane Helene. However, two hurricanes striking Florida only a week apart underscores our need to risk adjust our Property business. Our efforts here are evident with Q3 PIF growth in what we consider to be less volatile weather-related states of 19%, compared to a decrease of 9% in the volatile weather states. Risk adjustment has been and will be a year\u2019s long effort, but we are making progress. As always, our goal is to have all of our reporting segments meet their profitability targets, and we continue to make headway in our Property business with improved segmentation in our 5.0 product model and adjustments to our underwriting appetite. Ultimately, when I look across our results today, I see a huge amount of opportunity. While we can\u2019t know exactly what the future holds or what the market will bring, I believe that we are in a good position to be flexible and to react to whatever comes our way. The actions we take today are what position us for what we achieve next year and I firmly believe that we are in a good position headed into 2025. While there will undoubtedly be challenges, I\u2019m already looking forward to what I anticipate will be a great fourth quarter and a strong 2025. Thank you again and I will now take your questions.\nDoug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today\u2019s event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJosh Shanker: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. If we think about -- and good morning. If we think about the idea of growing at a 96% combined ratio or better, as fast as Progressive can, is that a revenue premium number or is that a policy count number? I ask this because there are some who are considering Progressive very, very good margins, votes for price cuts in the near-term future, but would Progressive cut price if it did not come with commensurate improvements to the policy count growth?\nTricia Griffith: Good morning, Josh. That\u2019s a good question. We look at both when we talk about grow as fast as we can. Some of our internal measures, success rates are based on our average PIF growth. And we always talk about our preferred growth is our unit growth, because trends can ebb and flow as you see in the last several years. So that\u2019s our preferred method. Obviously, we want to stay ahead of trend and we know that retention is very helpful if we have stable rates. So we want to get as many new apps in the door as possible through obviously our increased media spend, but then we want to keep those and so I think it\u2019s a balance of everything. So premium, we always want to stay ahead of trend and make at least that $0.04 and unit growth, we want to grow as fast as we can as long as we can service our customers in the way they deserve. Does that answer your question?\nJosh Shanker: Are the margins -- yes. So, I guess, more important, are the margins today so tasty that Progressive has a view that they should be considering price cuts in the near-term future?\nTricia Griffith: Well, what the price cuts, we will watch trend carefully. So like we said in the Q, we did about nine states of some price cuts, but we also had states that went up a little bit. So I think what I\u2019ve talked about in the past is really we want to use -- in the current margins we have, we want to use that to propel growth. So that will be the continued sort of march towards using our media spend to continue to have that organic growth. But we will see states and channels and products where we have to increase rates a little bit as well. We go back to that small bites of the apple where we just want to stay ahead of it and have those rates stable, but we believe we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to grow.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you very much.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from a line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBob Huang: Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on that, but more on the competitive environment perspective. As we think about your ad spending and as we think about your advantages in pricing or competitiveness in pricing, but if competition were to intensify in 2025 and going forward, how effective do you feel the ad spending and then the pricing side will be? Like, should we expect that incremental ad spend, but the effectiveness of the ad spend maybe will come down a little bit? Like, curious your view on this.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean, I think, competitors have taken this time to get their rates on the street and we see people coming back a little bit, not as quickly as we did, obviously, on the media side. We\u2019ll always look at media from an efficiency perspective and we\u2019ll want, if our cost per sale is still favorable to our targeted acquisition costs, we\u2019ll continue to spend to make sure that we get more customers and convert more customers. I think, really how we feel right now with our current margins and where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re going to continue to push on media and push on growth and we just feel like we\u2019re really well positioned, because if, and we believe we\u2019re still in a hard market, people, consumers continue to shop, we\u2019re going to have those stable rates. And in addition, we\u2019ve been spending and it\u2019s a little bit further afield, but we\u2019ve been spending money on not just getting business in the door, but some delayed response ads. So I don\u2019t know if you notice, I\u2019m sure you do, either in my comments or my letters, I talk a lot about our culture and our people and who we are and I don\u2019t know that enough people, consumers and customers and our communities know sort of our purpose, that we exist to help people move forward and live fully. We\u2019ve recently put out some ads, we call our Purpose Anthem to talk about progress and progress isn\u2019t overnight. You should look up Purpose on a page of Progressive in Google and you\u2019ll kind of see all the things we\u2019re doing. And so you\u2019re going to be seeing some ads with that that are a little bit more of a delayed response, but a response we believe will be nicely balanced with sort of who we are as a company that you want to be involved with. So we\u2019re excited about our growth. We love competition. Yeah, I think competition will continue to have the right rates and show up in media, but we\u2019re prepared.\nJay VanAntwerp: You might also have some response to both those questions.\nBob Huang: Thank you. very helpful.\nJay VanAntwerp: The way we operationalize in the marketplace, our objectives there is for our product managers and they are managing at the state and product level and they are assessing the competitive landscape where we sit by segment, they understand elasticity by channel and by locale. And they\u2019re making the calls that level to decide what we should be doing with price. Obviously the 96% is the objective, but to the extent we can manage and grow a lot beneath that, the product managers are going to make those calls. So I think when you look at our performance over time, you see the aggregate of all those decisions at the local level. So I think that I understand the questions, but I think understanding how we operationalize that in the marketplace is really important to understand our model.\nBob Huang: Okay. Very much appreciate that. Thank you. My second question is on retention. So if we look at your 10-Q commentaries, your -- for Auto business -- Personal Auto business, the policy life expectancy has been relatively elongated over probably more than a year now, right? And then that\u2019s been stabilized. If I remember correctly, your pricing is relative to the expected life cycle of a policy. So if that life cycle were to stabilize going forward, should we expect that favorable contribution to combined ratio to be less pronounced going forward? In other words, is it right to assume that you\u2019ll probably need some marginal pricing as that life cycle kind of stabilize rather than continue to improve? Did I lose you guys?\nOperator: Excuse me, everyone. One moment as we reconnect the speakers.\nTricia Griffith: Okay. Thanks, Victoria. I apologize for that. I thought that was on your end, but it was on our end. And so if we have questions at the end of the hour, we\u2019ll certainly elongate the time. So Bob, you were asking your second question and I think it was about retention. I think I must have jinxed us because this weekend when I was preparing, I\u2019m like, this is one of the best quarters in the history of Progressive. This is going to be great, and then of course, our computer crashed. So apologies again.\nBob Huang: Yeah. Can you guys hear me?\nTricia Griffith: Yes.\nBob Huang: Can you guys hear me? Okay. Excellent. Yeah. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have even better quarters down the road. So, yeah, question on retention. Your policy life expectancy is kind of, was growing over the last few quarters and now it\u2019s normalizing. Would that have a headwind to your combined ratio as given that you\u2019re essentially pricing towards an expected life expectancy for every policy or you don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue?\nTricia Griffith: Well, yeah, I mean, I think retention is kind of our Holy Grail. So it\u2019s always an issue to grow our units. So the T12 has been pretty flat and that\u2019s really a lot to do with some of the actions that we\u2019ve taken across the board. T3 was down and that\u2019s a lot on the comparison of last year when it was up 35%. But yeah, we watch that closely. We don\u2019t want to spend all of the media money to have customers come in and then just leave. So our focus really is those stable rates and great service to continue to improve retention. Do you want to add anything, Pat or John?\nJay VanAntwerp: No. I think that\u2019s good. Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Bob. Sorry about that again.\nBob Huang: Thank you. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Yes. Good morning. My first question, Tricia, I think you did hit on a little bit in your prepared remarks, but it was just about just the Q4, right? I think typically sometimes there\u2019s slower growth because of the holidays and vacation. I\u2019m just trying, want to understand how you think about that dynamic playing out this year, just given continued elevated shopping, as well as your marketing spend and how we could think about PIF gains in the last quarter of the year?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. Yeah. We\u2019re going to continue our push throughout the end of 2024. And it\u2019s really, we want to get more than our fair share of the shoppers, even if shoppers are a little bit less in November and December based on the holidays. And really we don\u2019t want to, you could easily say, well, wouldn\u2019t you just pull back a little bit for expenses on media? But really you want to have that consistent media spend and how -- and be prepared for that response and that shopping that we believe and normally typically happens in that first quarter. So it\u2019s really about, relative to our peers, are we in a good position, a better position? We believe that we are.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, right? And obviously record growth here for Progressive this year, as you think about the environment, right? You guys are obviously taking less rate, industry, right? Perhaps a bit behind you guys. How do you think about 2025? I know there\u2019s a lot of different variables, but just from a growth perspective sitting here today, how do you think next year could play out?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. We feel really good and bullish about 2025. And you\u2019re going to look at some stats that we talked about in our Q. I mean, 117% new app growth on the direct side, 98% on the agency side. Those are massive amounts. And obviously the comps will be more difficult, but that doesn\u2019t mean on a relative basis, in a unit basis, we\u2019re not going to grow literally as fast as we can. And we feel so much better about our rates, especially on the private passenger auto part, commercial and product. We\u2019re still having rate earn in, but we feel bullish about our positioning as well and our de-risking on the Property side. We feel like we really look at our growth from our strategic pillars. So we\u2019ve got a great culture and great people. We are very adequately staffed, especially in our call center organizations for sales and service and our claims organization to take care of our customers. We reduce our expenses on the non-acquisition expense ratio, because we care deeply about those competitive rates. We continue our segmentation. So you\u2019ve got people and culture, you\u2019ve got competitive rates, you\u2019ve got our brand, which continues to evolve and you\u2019ve got our broad coverage. We\u2019re going to be where, when and how customers want to shop. With those four strategic pillars and where we\u2019re at from a pricing perspective and a marketing perspective, I think, we have a huge opportunity in 2025.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line\u2019s open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to, oops, sorry, thanks. I wanted to drill down on the frequency severity trends that you put on the queue, specifically the BI liability. It looks like, anything to make of, it looks like the severity kind of moved up a bit and frequency kind of didn\u2019t improve as much as 2Q. Anything to make of that? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. From a BI perspective, it\u2019s a little bit higher some of the other line coverage. Mostly that is in higher large losses and more soft tissue injuries where there are attorney-repped. So that ends up usually being more expensive. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re reading a lot on social inflation and we have seen across the industry some pretty elevated jury verdicts that we believe are pretty egregious. So we\u2019re always keeping our eye on that. And bodily injury trends are less of a step function than were what happened with like used car prices where there was just sort of a confluence of events in terms of shortages of chips and all the things that came into play when car prices were risen. When you look at the history of BI trend, it sort of continues to move up based on attorney representation, based on medical bills, et cetera. So we\u2019re not too concerned about one quarter and we feel like we have our arms around the BI trends.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then second question just on homeowners. Can you remind us where you are with I guess the PIF reductions and cat exposed dates?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. So we talked a little bit about our PIF growth. So we\u2019re up 19% in our growth states and down 9% in our volatile states. We continue to have a really robust derisking program. So you\u2019ve seen the rate come in. We had 16 points year-to-date, 20 on the trailing 12, 5 more points to earn in this year. And then we have other rates that are elevating. So that\u2019s the first one, get the right rates on the street. We talked a lot about segmentation and what we\u2019ve been working off, our 5.0 product. Segmentation is something that we believe we are industry leaders in and we need to be at least in auto for sure in Commercial Auto. And we will be there in Property as we continue to work on segmentation. We talked about exiting about 115,000 homes in Florida last year. That takes some time by the time you communicate it to insureds and you\u2019re able to do that. And of course there can be moratoriums after states. And we\u2019ve been exiting DP3 in many states. That\u2019s obviously, we have to have prior approval through our DOIs, but we have approval in about 22 states and are working with many more to exit that line of coverage. And then really it\u2019s about cost sharing. We don\u2019t want homeowners to be a maintenance program. So we have a mandatory wind and hail deductibles, and those are kind of being through the system. And then lastly, just conversations with our agents on putting high quality business and high quality bundled business, which is usually preferred in owner occupied homes on the Progressive balance sheet. So we got it -- it\u2019s a multi-tiered plan. We knew it would take a while. We signaled this a while ago, but I feel very good about where we\u2019re at. But clearly having two huge hurricanes less than a week apart really elevates what our plan has been for a while and what will be in the future.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I know you\u2019ve mentioned trying to leverage your agent compensation program to reward profitable business. Maybe you can spend a minute and just give us a snapshot if you\u2019ve changed how you\u2019re rewarding your agents and how they\u2019re helping you underwrite business, new business as it comes in the door.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I\u2019ll let Pat give more color than I will, but we\u2019re constantly evolving our agents and we have agents that are more specialized. It\u2019s preferred bundling. We have our platinum agents. We have agents that have typically been more on SAMs, maybe some mom and pops, but we constantly evolve our compensation to make sure that we put high quality business on the books, but also reward those agents for that business. Pat, do you want to give any more color on that?\nPatrick Callahan: Sure. We have an aligned national commission structure that we have in place for either our Property agents, so those with the full suite of products or those without access to our Property products. And those matrices are designed to reward higher quality business and greater volume of business. And over time, what we see is agents respond well to understanding what the targets are, understanding how the framework works and understanding how their behaviors and the actions allocating different business to Progressive can result in better compensation for their agencies. Now, Tricia mentioned on the quality side of things, as we pivot and start to invest more to turn the Property business around, there are tactics within the agency channel that will ensure that agents know they have to be bundling business with us, they have to write with our underwriting guidelines in mind and we measure that through underwriting cancel rates, and they have to produce a certain amount of volume to retain their Property appointment with us. And we think those three in combination with a very clear, transparent national compensation plan, agents understand what we\u2019re offering, how we fit in their agencies, and ultimately, how we can mutually benefit by producing high quality, profitable business.\nGregory Peters: Makes sense. For my follow-up question, in your letter, Tricia, you said you have nearly 4.2 million more policies in force than you did at the end of last year. In response to some of the questions in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you\u2019re fully staffed. Maybe you can give us a sense of how you\u2019re keeping fully staffed with such tremendous growth in a macro environment, it seems, full employment, and maybe segue, one of the things that we never get much information from you or many of your peers is how you\u2019re deploying technology and artificial intelligence, and maybe that\u2019s helping you with the growth in policy in force. So any commentary on that would be great.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. That\u2019s a really great question. So what we\u2019ve been doing, the only time that I can recall we had difficulty in hiring and retaining was sort of when the wage wars started right after the pandemic. So after that, we\u2019ve done a couple of things. We\u2019ve hired well in advance of need. So when you think about being a fully licensed sales rep in our call center or a fully trained claims rep out in the field, it takes some time. And so that\u2019s, well, it\u2019s maybe a more expensive venture at first blush. We think that pays for itself because we have high quality people handling your calls, handling your claims. And in fact, we were able to deploy between our own employees and independent appraisers to help us with the storms. 2,300 people sort of feed in the street, getting early contacts and early closures in our catastrophes, which is what our customers need us most. So we feel really good about that. From a technology and efficiency perspective, we are always talking about how do we become more efficient? One, to keep prices competitive, but two, can we take easier claims, easier calls out of the system and have humans actually handle the more complex calls? So we have overall what you can call it, AI, ChatGPT, large language miles. We\u2019ve been working on those for a long time to become more efficient. We\u2019ve had a chatbot in our call centers for over a decade because we found out we were getting repetitive calls that really didn\u2019t require human intervention and that took out about 15% of our calls. On the claim side, we have a lot of automation with our estimates. We have tagged millions and millions of pictures to be able to do that. And of course, we want to make sure that we do have human intervention to make sure we always pay the right amount and that we\u2019re accurate in that part of it. But we\u2019re very technology driven. Besides being efficient, we want to be innovative. And we want to continue to learn and make sure that we use the highly trained individuals that we have for the most complex parts of our business. So we use a lot of AI. Maybe that\u2019s something we can talk about at a later deep dive when we have some time in one of the quarters that we do that. But we feel like that\u2019s a key part overall in our efficiency, which is key to our growth.\nGregory Peters: Thank you for the detail.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from a line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So most of my questions were answered, but just -- it seems like many of your competitors are shifting their focus to growth as their margins have recovered. So just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in terms of competitor behavior on marketing spending and on pricing. And is it reasonable to assume that your growth over the next few quarters should slow down just as the market becomes more competitive?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I think, like I said before, our competitors, what I would say is, we got out ahead of the game. We saw what we needed. We knew that that would be frustrating because we had to raise rates so significantly to keep up with trend. We did that quickly. And our plan was that would allow us to be in a position to grow and it certainly has paid off. We are seeing -- and if you see any of the quarterly results, margins are so much better with our competition and so I would imagine that they will continue to grow. We\u2019ve seen some of our competitors, for sure, start to spend more on media. What -- for us, competition is good. And it really is about, like I said, having all those strategic players firing at the same time. So while I can\u2019t predict what our growth will be, we have models, obviously, internally that we work on. I believe we\u2019re in a really great position to wrap up 2024 and move into 2025. And I feel very confident that we will continue to gain traction. Of course, given all the unknowns that could happen with weather and what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay.\nPatrick Callahan: Yeah. The only thing that I would add is\u2026\nJimmy Bhullar: \u2026and then\u2026\nPatrick Callahan: \u2026 spending more.\nTricia Griffith: Hold on for a second, Jimmy. I think I wanted Pat to add on some color on that for you.\nPatrick Callahan: The only thing I would add is that segmentation matters. So spending more isn\u2019t necessarily going to drive the outcome folks desire. It\u2019s spending it smartly and understanding the lifetime value of the customer and the media that we use to reach those customers. So we think given our scale and given the analytics we have in place, we are creating segmentation in the media world like we have in the product segmentation space. And that segmentation enables us to understand where to spend more efficiently based on who we\u2019re able to acquire and it\u2019s not just about spending more overall, it\u2019s spending it in the right places. Additionally, I think when you see what we do on the product segmentation side, we do think that creating adverse selection for our competitors through matching rate to risk more precisely does inflate their trend different than ours over time and that synthetic trend we think requires them over time to potentially have to adjust rates differently than we have. So we\u2019re pretty confident that at this point. We are efficient in our spend. And as Tricia mentioned, we monitor it extremely closely and we\u2019ll adjust as needed over time, but we play our game and we managed our economics and they look good at this point.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thanks. And it seems like obviously there\u2019s been a lot of talk about Personal interest in Commercial Lines. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of long-term trends in Personal Auto as it relates to litigation, attorney rep rates and stuff?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. Attorney rep rates have risen over the years. Again, not as a function, they\u2019ve risen, you can probably tell just by advertising from that perspective. Medical trends, as you know, from just medical insurance have continued to go up. So it\u2019s continued to trend upward, we priced for that. And some of the social inflation, like I said, with some egregious verdicts in the industry are always troublesome because it ends up, consumers have to pay for that and so we always want to get our arms around. It\u2019s really about doing what we have done well for many, many years and that is making sure that our customers know we\u2019re there for them, that they can trust us to do the right thing by them and that I try to get out in front of the claim with contacts and resolution as quickly as possible or when it\u2019s a longer term claim to make sure that we communicate and respect their needs along the way. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing since we rolled out IR years and years ago or immediate response, I should say, years ago. Just get in front of the customers, make sure they know we\u2019re there and we want them to trust us and that we\u2019ll be fair.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on just the auto PIF growth and I\u2019m wondering if Hurricane Helene had a notable impact in Florida or the Carolinas on auto shopping and PIF gains at the end of September and if Milton -- Hurricane Milton, is causing any disruption on retention or shopping just given the impacts of that storm?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say anything. The PIF growth wouldn\u2019t come from that necessarily. Obviously, there\u2019ll be some total loss vehicles that when they replace, we hope they\u2019ll be Progressive. I think that, I had asked John Murphy, our President of Claims a while ago, if we were seeing issues with inventory for new cars, I thought that could be something that could be a headwind for consumers and they didn\u2019t see inventory issues. There\u2019s enough inventory, we believe, on the street to be able to take care of those customers. But the storm, although they were big, I don\u2019t think would move the needle on either of those.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nDavid Motemaden: And then on the cost per sale that you spoke about, I think, last quarter it was like 30% below your targeted acquisition ratio. I\u2019m wondering where that stood here in third quarter as some of the competition returns and maybe just also if you could just talk about if ambient shopping levels, sounds like they remain high, but did they -- have they fallen any at all here during the last three months? Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I\u2019m going to try to answer that. You were breaking up a little bit. I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s on our side. I would say we continue to see elevated shopping, continue to see a hard market and so we\u2019re going to leverage that. And again, I talked a little bit in an earlier answer on we\u2019ve got our sort of direct response, which we see right away with our highest NP6, which are new prospects, which of course, we equate to our, the apps that are such high growth on both the direct and agency side, but then also some delayed response. And so we believe ambient shopping is still up because even with the increased amount that we\u2019ve spent and we\u2019ll spend in quarter four on the delayed response ad, we\u2019re still seeing that shopping. So we feel good about that. I want to make sure I answered your question because you were breaking up a little bit. Does that answer your question?\nDavid Motemaden: Yeah. That does help on the ambient shopping. I had just asked on just how much below the targeted acquisition spend the cost per sale is. In third quarter, I think, it was 30% below in the first half of the year. Is that still pretty far below your target?\nTricia Griffith: All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s still below tax. So our CPS for quarter three is still below our target acquisition cost. And again, like Pat said, we continue, and I just had an incredible two-day media business review. We continue to understand exactly how to reach the consumers we want to reach and get more efficient with doing that all across the Board. I think normally we\u2019ll talk about mass media spend and that\u2019s a portion of our spend, but there\u2019s so many other ways that we are able to be on the short list for consumers who are shopping. So we feel good about where we\u2019re at right now with CPS below tax.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. Tricia, I was hoping you could comment a little bit about this really favorable frequency we\u2019ve been seeing for the last 12 months. Is this something you think is sustainable? Is it a function of the hard market and auto insurance? What is your perspective on it?\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Brian. For us, what we\u2019ve seen is really the biggest proportion of that is equated to our mix -- our preferred mix has increased, and so that\u2019s obviously a lower frequency. We\u2019re a little bit less negative than we were before, but still again, obviously negative 5. So we will continue to watch that as we grow and put more customers on the book. Obviously, we always want to make our target profit margins both on a calendar year and lifetime value.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. So mix. Got you. And then second question just quickly.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah.\nBrian Meredith: Where are new money yields relative to book yields right now in the investment portfolio? Is there still some uplift in book yields going forward, do you think?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I\u2019ll let Jon Bauer get on because he\u2019s always on these calls and never gets to talk. But yeah, we\u2019ve been happy that we\u2019ve been able to invest new money into higher yielding performance. And Jon, I\u2019ll let you go into some of the detail.\nJon Bauer: Yeah. Thanks very much. As you\u2019ve been seeing over the last, throughout the course of the last few years, but certainly over the last few months, there\u2019s been quite a lot of volatility in interest rates, especially as we headed towards the election and the Fed started cutting rates. For us, as you know, we have a relatively short duration portfolio, just a little bit over three years. And so the two things that are going to really adjust the new money yields versus the book yields would be the underlying level of interest rates, which has risen quite significantly since the end of the third quarter. And then as well as we allocate money into and out of cash and treasuries into other risk products. Right now we have a relatively conservative allocation. And so if we were to shift that, that would increase book yields over time. But obviously the underlying movement in interest rates as -- will likely increase prospective book yields if they were to maintain around this level. But I would just want to point out that for Progressive, the driving force in our investment strategy is a total rate of return strategy. So the book yield is an output of the decisions we make. But for us, we\u2019re really looking to drive the strongest total return over the longer term. Does that answer your question?\nBrian Meredith: Yeah. That does. That\u2019s terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is now open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Great. Thank you very much. So in the past, I know we\u2019ve talked about the ordered pairs where sometimes, I guess, Progressive will maintain excess profits if the growth trade-off isn\u2019t necessarily worth it. I was hoping you could give us some insight into how much of the Personal Line margin outperformance this year is sort of ordered pairs dependent and how much of it is just the fact that you\u2019ve been surprised by loss trends?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think, I\u2019ll let Pat weigh in a little bit more. But I think the margin comes from so many different things. So if -- are we efficient in our spend to get more customers? So I wouldn\u2019t say -- I wouldn\u2019t call it excess profits. I would say we look at every dollar premium and what outputs we think would happen based on our frequency and severity trends, what we think we could spend to get more customers, the new and renewal business. And we go to each state, each product, et cetera, roll it up, roll it down and come to that. And then if we\u2019re inefficient in our spend, then we\u2019ll either try to get more efficient or pull back. If our margins shrink, we\u2019ll pull back. We have a lot of different levers, but really it all goes under the umbrella of grow as fast as we can at or below our 96%. Pat, do you want to add anything?\nPatrick Callahan: Yeah. And I would say that the growth that we\u2019re seeing wasn\u2019t expected earlier in the year. So we knew we had shields up when we were slowing the business down to deliver 2023 calendar year profitability and as we\u2019ve reduced some of those verification tactics and gotten, frankly, more competitive with billing options, et cetera, we have seen, as you see in the reports, outsized growth. So I don\u2019t think we entered the year saying we think we can produce this level of profit and growth on a significantly extended period. So right now you see we\u2019ve taken rates down a small amount in a number of states. And as John mentioned, our product managers constantly evolve that competitive environment to see how much ambient shopping there is, how efficient our media spend is and as we come into kind of the slower shopping period of the year, we\u2019ll be monitoring our spend and our rate level to make sure we can grow as fast as our staffing levels and service levels enable us to. So we\u2019ve got some really high comps coming into next year and feel great about how we\u2019re closing out this year. But I don\u2019t -- I think the growth is the piece of the ordered pair that was outperforming this year and it wasn\u2019t certainly in our plan at the outset to be able to capture as much growth as we have. But with competitors raising rates and restricting access to new business, your media becomes really efficient when there\u2019s not a lot of people competing for the clicks or in market with competitive rates for the shoppers.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. What I would add on that as well is and we talked about this a little bit when we had our media deep dive a quarter or so ago. We are so flexible with our media spend. And the last couple of years, unfortunately we\u2019ve had to pull back because of margins. This year, Pat and his team have come to me to increase media on several occasions and being able to be that nimble to do that and not say, okay, we have a budget at the beginning of the year which we do, we set a budget for a year we think will happen. But having that flexibility and turning things on and off pretty quickly to sort of open up or close the spigot has been key this year to open up the spigot.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful very detailed. Thank you. Can you give us an insight into, I know there\u2019s obviously this ongoing regional mix shift in Property? What are the other steps that are appropriate to get that line targeted to mine ratios?\nTricia Griffith: Well, I think, it\u2019s definitely the rate increases we\u2019ve been taking. I think it\u2019s the geographic mix. It is absolutely the segmentation that will continue to deepen. It\u2019s the cost sharing with customers, like I said, with wind and hail deductibles. And it\u2019s our agency actions, making sure we have solid owner occupied homes on the book that are bundled. So it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s all the things that I talked about before and it\u2019s just one of those things that takes time and we watch it very closely. And we have a whole team of people that are constantly monitoring where we should be, where we should slow down. But those are -- it\u2019s just a plethora of things to get it right in and I have confidence that we will.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, Meyer.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Your line is now open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey. Great. Good morning. As a follow-up to, I think it was Brian\u2019s question about frequency, the curve being, your frequency is even better than its historic relationship to the industry. You talked about the mix towards preferred helping. I\u2019m just curious, is there a partial offset longer term? Should just the preferred customer have a different or higher severity inflation trend line than the average of the book?\nTricia Griffith: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything huge in that. I think the preferred customers could have more products. Obviously, it\u2019s a rate to risk that we\u2019re looking at. It could be stickier with other products that come with us. And really, frequency has been trending down for the last 50 years or 60 years. I\u2019m not sure what stable frequency means because it\u2019s been so oddly volatile over the last four years. But -- and also, we do want to write any business that we can. Sam Sands writes Robinsons [ph] as long as we reach our target profit margin. So we\u2019re fully open for business for any consumer as long as we can make that target profit margins. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And my follow-up is switching gears to the competitive environment. So if we think about your average peer, they sell a lot more home insurance than Progressive does and they bundle a lot of that with auto. And I know you guys are obviously increasing your share on home and bundles, but still, I think it\u2019s much smaller than your average competitor or some of your larger competitors. So I\u2019m curious, so given home insurance is still a hard market and will be for the foreseeable future, is that dynamic causing any of your peers the need to increase the bundle pricing more so than you all are, which is kind of helping you in the competitive environment for you all to gain customers? If that was my question, if you follow it.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I\u2019ll add in. I mean, I think it\u2019s hard because different competitors do it differently. Some are growing and have Property, but not on their own paper. Some of our competitors have sort of derisked before us and are in a position then to grow, but not necessarily in the places that have the volatile weather. And some are bundled, I mean, a lot, when you look at captive agencies are really sticky because they\u2019re bundled for a long time. That eventually, that\u2019s where we want to be able to be, whether the home is on our paper or on the sort of stable group of carriers we work with. We want to make sure that that broad coverage, just be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And that\u2019s why we developed, we obviously want to bundle more, but that bundle has to be profitable and -- but we want to make sure that we can, when people call in, give them what they need, whether it\u2019s on with our Home Quote Explorer, our Auto Quote Explorer, or our Business Quote Explorer. And sometimes, hopefully it\u2019s with us, but if not, we\u2019ll take care of them with customers or I should say businesses that we partner with. So the competitive environment we look to, but we really are playing our own game here, especially with Property as we evolve and mature. And you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t have the same probably percentage market share. Clearly we don\u2019t, but we want to take that slowly so that we make prudent decisions for the long-term of the firm.\nDoug Constantine: That appears to have been our final question and so that concludes our event. Again, we apologize for the technical difficulties. Victoria, I will hand the call back over to you for the closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation third quarter investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive\u2019s website for the next year. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin today by extending my sympathies to those affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The scenes of destruction were truly heart-wrenching and the human toll of these storms was devastating. As the cleanup efforts continue, I'm heartened to know that Progressive's excellent claim staff is standing by to assist our customers in their greatest time of need. In fact, I've heard countless versions of stories like the one I'm about to share with you. This is when our customers need us most, and when we shine the brightest. My name is Anne-Marie and my fiance is Timothy. We just lost our RV with this last Hurricane Helene. I've been in Tampa for two months sitting by Timothy's bedside while he fought cancer. I'm happy to say that he is in remission. I came back to Fort Myers Beach to meet with the adjuster, Ray. I would like to tell you about my encounter with this lovely gentleman. Ray was prompt, professional and showed compassion for my loss of our home. He is the perfect person to be assessing the damages of one's property. I cannot say enough positive things about Ray. He is one of a kind and it was a pleasure to meet under these horrible circumstances. That's what it's all about. To my clients' colleagues, you amaze me every day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you do each and every day. Turning towards results. The third quarter was one of our strongest in our history. Across our businesses, we added almost 1.6 million policies in force, the most we've ever added in a quarter. This brings the total policies added this year to nearly 4.2 million, truly a remarkable feat. The magnitude of this growth during the year requires increases in sales, servicing and claim staffing, and our teams have met the challenge, enabling us to maximize growth while providing the quality experience our customers expect of us. Throughout the third quarter, we experienced very strong demand for our Personal Lines products across both channels. While direct channel new application growth responded almost immediately to our increase in media spend and the release of non-rate actions earlier in the year, as evidenced by the channel's stronger new business growth in Q2, the agency channel's growth potential wasn't fully realized until the last few weeks of the second quarter. The result is a third quarter where our growth machine was firing on all cylinders with clear results in both channels experiencing record levels of new applications. To-date, the level of ambient shopping and Personal Auto remains very high, ambient capitalized on that. In Q3 2024, we spent more on media than in any quarter in our history. The result was a higher number of direct channel prospects than any quarter in our history, surpassing Q2 2024, the previous record holder. Additionally, conversion is strong, suggesting that we are well-priced compared to the competition. Though the fourth quarter, especially November and December, are historically lower in sales volume, we believe that we can continue to position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of prospects from the marketplace. The record growth is even more impressive when you consider our profit margins. Our year-to-date combined ratio through Q3 was very strong. Though the cost of Hurricane Milton are not reflected in our Q3 numbers, 2024 is still shaping up to be one of the best non-pandemic years in our history. Growing at our pace with record profits is a testament to the investment we've made in segmentation over the years and we're not standing still. Our newest product model, which continues to add further segmentation in our Personal Auto products, is available in states that represent about one-third of our net written premium. You'll recall that in 2022 and 2023, the Commercial Auto market was impacted by many of the same inflationary pressures as Personal Lines. In response to the rising loss costs, we took double-digit rate increases in 2023. In Q3 2024, we reported our third straight quarter of quarter-over-quarter improvement in our loss and LAE ratio for Commercial Lines. Our results in part from the rate we took in 2023, earning in, which is a slower process in Commercial Lines, since the majority of our policies are 12 months. Growth has been more difficult in that line as the softness in the truck market has offset solid growth in our other non-trucking business market targets. As our competitors catch up in rate, however, we are optimistic that we're well-positioned for more growth in the future. The third quarter results in Property were excellent at a 78.5 combined ratio, after almost 30 points of favorable development on storms from the first half of the year, and despite the 21 points of losses incurred by Hurricane Helene. However, two hurricanes striking Florida only a week apart underscores our need to risk adjust our Property business. Our efforts here are evident with Q3 PIF growth in what we consider to be less volatile weather-related states of 19%, compared to a decrease of 9% in the volatile weather states. Risk adjustment has been and will be a year's long effort, but we are making progress. As always, our goal is to have all of our reporting segments meet their profitability targets, and we continue to make headway in our Property business with improved segmentation in our 5.0 product model and adjustments to our underwriting appetite. Ultimately, when I look across our results today, I see a huge amount of opportunity. While we can't know exactly what the future holds or what the market will bring, I believe that we are in a good position to be flexible and to react to whatever comes our way. The actions we take today are what position us for what we achieve next year and I firmly believe that we are in a good position headed into 2025. While there will undoubtedly be challenges, I'm already looking forward to what I anticipate will be a great fourth quarter and a strong 2025. Thank you again and I will now take your questions. Good morning, Josh. That's a good question. We look at both when we talk about grow as fast as we can. Some of our internal measures, success rates are based on our average PIF growth. And we always talk about our preferred growth is our unit growth, because trends can ebb and flow as you see in the last several years. So that's our preferred method. Obviously, we want to stay ahead of trend and we know that retention is very helpful if we have stable rates. So we want to get as many new apps in the door as possible through obviously our increased media spend, but then we want to keep those and so I think it's a balance of everything. So premium, we always want to stay ahead of trend and make at least that $0.04 and unit growth, we want to grow as fast as we can as long as we can service our customers in the way they deserve. Does that answer your question? Well, what the price cuts, we will watch trend carefully. So like we said in the Q, we did about nine states of some price cuts, but we also had states that went up a little bit. So I think what I've talked about in the past is really we want to use -- in the current margins we have, we want to use that to propel growth. So that will be the continued sort of march towards using our media spend to continue to have that organic growth. But we will see states and channels and products where we have to increase rates a little bit as well. We go back to that small bites of the apple where we just want to stay ahead of it and have those rates stable, but we believe we're really well positioned to continue to grow. Thanks, Josh. Yeah. I mean, I think, competitors have taken this time to get their rates on the street and we see people coming back a little bit, not as quickly as we did, obviously, on the media side. We'll always look at media from an efficiency perspective and we'll want, if our cost per sale is still favorable to our targeted acquisition costs, we'll continue to spend to make sure that we get more customers and convert more customers. I think, really how we feel right now with our current margins and where we're at, we're going to continue to push on media and push on growth and we just feel like we're really well positioned, because if, and we believe we're still in a hard market, people, consumers continue to shop, we're going to have those stable rates. And in addition, we've been spending and it's a little bit further afield, but we've been spending money on not just getting business in the door, but some delayed response ads. So I don't know if you notice, I'm sure you do, either in my comments or my letters, I talk a lot about our culture and our people and who we are and I don't know that enough people, consumers and customers and our communities know sort of our purpose, that we exist to help people move forward and live fully. We've recently put out some ads, we call our Purpose Anthem to talk about progress and progress isn't overnight. You should look up Purpose on a page of Progressive in Google and you'll kind of see all the things we're doing. And so you're going to be seeing some ads with that that are a little bit more of a delayed response, but a response we believe will be nicely balanced with sort of who we are as a company that you want to be involved with. So we're excited about our growth. We love competition. Yeah, I think competition will continue to have the right rates and show up in media, but we're prepared. Okay. Thanks, Victoria. I apologize for that. I thought that was on your end, but it was on our end. And so if we have questions at the end of the hour, we'll certainly elongate the time. So Bob, you were asking your second question and I think it was about retention. I think I must have jinxed us because this weekend when I was preparing, I'm like, this is one of the best quarters in the history of Progressive. This is going to be great, and then of course, our computer crashed. So apologies again. Yes. Well, yeah, I mean, I think retention is kind of our Holy Grail. So it's always an issue to grow our units. So the T12 has been pretty flat and that's really a lot to do with some of the actions that we've taken across the board. T3 was down and that's a lot on the comparison of last year when it was up 35%. But yeah, we watch that closely. We don't want to spend all of the media money to have customers come in and then just leave. So our focus really is those stable rates and great service to continue to improve retention. Do you want to add anything, Pat or John? Thanks, Bob. Sorry about that again. Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. Yeah. We're going to continue our push throughout the end of 2024. And it's really, we want to get more than our fair share of the shoppers, even if shoppers are a little bit less in November and December based on the holidays. And really we don't want to, you could easily say, well, wouldn't you just pull back a little bit for expenses on media? But really you want to have that consistent media spend and how -- and be prepared for that response and that shopping that we believe and normally typically happens in that first quarter. So it's really about, relative to our peers, are we in a good position, a better position? We believe that we are. Yeah. We feel really good and bullish about 2025. And you're going to look at some stats that we talked about in our Q. I mean, 117% new app growth on the direct side, 98% on the agency side. Those are massive amounts. And obviously the comps will be more difficult, but that doesn't mean on a relative basis, in a unit basis, we're not going to grow literally as fast as we can. And we feel so much better about our rates, especially on the private passenger auto part, commercial and product. We're still having rate earn in, but we feel bullish about our positioning as well and our de-risking on the Property side. We feel like we really look at our growth from our strategic pillars. So we've got a great culture and great people. We are very adequately staffed, especially in our call center organizations for sales and service and our claims organization to take care of our customers. We reduce our expenses on the non-acquisition expense ratio, because we care deeply about those competitive rates. We continue our segmentation. So you've got people and culture, you've got competitive rates, you've got our brand, which continues to evolve and you've got our broad coverage. We're going to be where, when and how customers want to shop. With those four strategic pillars and where we're at from a pricing perspective and a marketing perspective, I think, we have a huge opportunity in 2025. Thanks, Elyse. Yeah. From a BI perspective, it's a little bit higher some of the other line coverage. Mostly that is in higher large losses and more soft tissue injuries where there are attorney-repped. So that ends up usually being more expensive. And I'm sure you're reading a lot on social inflation and we have seen across the industry some pretty elevated jury verdicts that we believe are pretty egregious. So we're always keeping our eye on that. And bodily injury trends are less of a step function than were what happened with like used car prices where there was just sort of a confluence of events in terms of shortages of chips and all the things that came into play when car prices were risen. When you look at the history of BI trend, it sort of continues to move up based on attorney representation, based on medical bills, et cetera. So we're not too concerned about one quarter and we feel like we have our arms around the BI trends. Yeah. So we talked a little bit about our PIF growth. So we're up 19% in our growth states and down 9% in our volatile states. We continue to have a really robust derisking program. So you've seen the rate come in. We had 16 points year-to-date, 20 on the trailing 12, 5 more points to earn in this year. And then we have other rates that are elevating. So that's the first one, get the right rates on the street. We talked a lot about segmentation and what we've been working off, our 5.0 product. Segmentation is something that we believe we are industry leaders in and we need to be at least in auto for sure in Commercial Auto. And we will be there in Property as we continue to work on segmentation. We talked about exiting about 115,000 homes in Florida last year. That takes some time by the time you communicate it to insureds and you're able to do that. And of course there can be moratoriums after states. And we've been exiting DP3 in many states. That's obviously, we have to have prior approval through our DOIs, but we have approval in about 22 states and are working with many more to exit that line of coverage. And then really it's about cost sharing. We don't want homeowners to be a maintenance program. So we have a mandatory wind and hail deductibles, and those are kind of being through the system. And then lastly, just conversations with our agents on putting high quality business and high quality bundled business, which is usually preferred in owner occupied homes on the Progressive balance sheet. So we got it -- it's a multi-tiered plan. We knew it would take a while. We signaled this a while ago, but I feel very good about where we're at. But clearly having two huge hurricanes less than a week apart really elevates what our plan has been for a while and what will be in the future. Thanks, Michael. Yeah. I'll let Pat give more color than I will, but we're constantly evolving our agents and we have agents that are more specialized. It's preferred bundling. We have our platinum agents. We have agents that have typically been more on SAMs, maybe some mom and pops, but we constantly evolve our compensation to make sure that we put high quality business on the books, but also reward those agents for that business. Pat, do you want to give any more color on that? Yeah. That's a really great question. So what we've been doing, the only time that I can recall we had difficulty in hiring and retaining was sort of when the wage wars started right after the pandemic. So after that, we've done a couple of things. We've hired well in advance of need. So when you think about being a fully licensed sales rep in our call center or a fully trained claims rep out in the field, it takes some time. And so that's, well, it's maybe a more expensive venture at first blush. We think that pays for itself because we have high quality people handling your calls, handling your claims. And in fact, we were able to deploy between our own employees and independent appraisers to help us with the storms. 2,300 people sort of feed in the street, getting early contacts and early closures in our catastrophes, which is what our customers need us most. So we feel really good about that. From a technology and efficiency perspective, we are always talking about how do we become more efficient? One, to keep prices competitive, but two, can we take easier claims, easier calls out of the system and have humans actually handle the more complex calls? So we have overall what you can call it, AI, ChatGPT, large language miles. We've been working on those for a long time to become more efficient. We've had a chatbot in our call centers for over a decade because we found out we were getting repetitive calls that really didn't require human intervention and that took out about 15% of our calls. On the claim side, we have a lot of automation with our estimates. We have tagged millions and millions of pictures to be able to do that. And of course, we want to make sure that we do have human intervention to make sure we always pay the right amount and that we're accurate in that part of it. But we're very technology driven. Besides being efficient, we want to be innovative. And we want to continue to learn and make sure that we use the highly trained individuals that we have for the most complex parts of our business. So we use a lot of AI. Maybe that's something we can talk about at a later deep dive when we have some time in one of the quarters that we do that. But we feel like that's a key part overall in our efficiency, which is key to our growth. Thank you. Yeah. I think, like I said before, our competitors, what I would say is, we got out ahead of the game. We saw what we needed. We knew that that would be frustrating because we had to raise rates so significantly to keep up with trend. We did that quickly. And our plan was that would allow us to be in a position to grow and it certainly has paid off. We are seeing -- and if you see any of the quarterly results, margins are so much better with our competition and so I would imagine that they will continue to grow. We've seen some of our competitors, for sure, start to spend more on media. What -- for us, competition is good. And it really is about, like I said, having all those strategic players firing at the same time. So while I can't predict what our growth will be, we have models, obviously, internally that we work on. I believe we're in a really great position to wrap up 2024 and move into 2025. And I feel very confident that we will continue to gain traction. Of course, given all the unknowns that could happen with weather and what we've seen over the last several years. Hold on for a second, Jimmy. I think I wanted Pat to add on some color on that for you. Yeah. Attorney rep rates have risen over the years. Again, not as a function, they've risen, you can probably tell just by advertising from that perspective. Medical trends, as you know, from just medical insurance have continued to go up. So it's continued to trend upward, we priced for that. And some of the social inflation, like I said, with some egregious verdicts in the industry are always troublesome because it ends up, consumers have to pay for that and so we always want to get our arms around. It's really about doing what we have done well for many, many years and that is making sure that our customers know we're there for them, that they can trust us to do the right thing by them and that I try to get out in front of the claim with contacts and resolution as quickly as possible or when it's a longer term claim to make sure that we communicate and respect their needs along the way. So that's what we've been doing since we rolled out IR years and years ago or immediate response, I should say, years ago. Just get in front of the customers, make sure they know we're there and we want them to trust us and that we'll be fair. Yes. I wouldn't say anything. The PIF growth wouldn't come from that necessarily. Obviously, there'll be some total loss vehicles that when they replace, we hope they'll be Progressive. I think that, I had asked John Murphy, our President of Claims a while ago, if we were seeing issues with inventory for new cars, I thought that could be something that could be a headwind for consumers and they didn't see inventory issues. There's enough inventory, we believe, on the street to be able to take care of those customers. But the storm, although they were big, I don't think would move the needle on either of those. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to try to answer that. You were breaking up a little bit. I'm going to assume that's on our side. I would say we continue to see elevated shopping, continue to see a hard market and so we're going to leverage that. And again, I talked a little bit in an earlier answer on we've got our sort of direct response, which we see right away with our highest NP6, which are new prospects, which of course, we equate to our, the apps that are such high growth on both the direct and agency side, but then also some delayed response. And so we believe ambient shopping is still up because even with the increased amount that we've spent and we'll spend in quarter four on the delayed response ad, we're still seeing that shopping. So we feel good about that. I want to make sure I answered your question because you were breaking up a little bit. Does that answer your question? All I'm saying is that it's still below tax. So our CPS for quarter three is still below our target acquisition cost. And again, like Pat said, we continue, and I just had an incredible two-day media business review. We continue to understand exactly how to reach the consumers we want to reach and get more efficient with doing that all across the Board. I think normally we'll talk about mass media spend and that's a portion of our spend, but there's so many other ways that we are able to be on the short list for consumers who are shopping. So we feel good about where we're at right now with CPS below tax. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. For us, what we've seen is really the biggest proportion of that is equated to our mix -- our preferred mix has increased, and so that's obviously a lower frequency. We're a little bit less negative than we were before, but still again, obviously negative 5. So we will continue to watch that as we grow and put more customers on the book. Obviously, we always want to make our target profit margins both on a calendar year and lifetime value. Yeah. Yeah. I'll let Jon Bauer get on because he's always on these calls and never gets to talk. But yeah, we've been happy that we've been able to invest new money into higher yielding performance. And Jon, I'll let you go into some of the detail. Well, I think, I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit more. But I think the margin comes from so many different things. So if -- are we efficient in our spend to get more customers? So I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't call it excess profits. I would say we look at every dollar premium and what outputs we think would happen based on our frequency and severity trends, what we think we could spend to get more customers, the new and renewal business. And we go to each state, each product, et cetera, roll it up, roll it down and come to that. And then if we're inefficient in our spend, then we'll either try to get more efficient or pull back. If our margins shrink, we'll pull back. We have a lot of different levers, but really it all goes under the umbrella of grow as fast as we can at or below our 96%. Pat, do you want to add anything? Yeah. What I would add on that as well is and we talked about this a little bit when we had our media deep dive a quarter or so ago. We are so flexible with our media spend. And the last couple of years, unfortunately we've had to pull back because of margins. This year, Pat and his team have come to me to increase media on several occasions and being able to be that nimble to do that and not say, okay, we have a budget at the beginning of the year which we do, we set a budget for a year we think will happen. But having that flexibility and turning things on and off pretty quickly to sort of open up or close the spigot has been key this year to open up the spigot. Well, I think, it's definitely the rate increases we've been taking. I think it's the geographic mix. It is absolutely the segmentation that will continue to deepen. It's the cost sharing with customers, like I said, with wind and hail deductibles. And it's our agency actions, making sure we have solid owner occupied homes on the book that are bundled. So it's not one thing, it's all the things that I talked about before and it's just one of those things that takes time and we watch it very closely. And we have a whole team of people that are constantly monitoring where we should be, where we should slow down. But those are -- it's just a plethora of things to get it right in and I have confidence that we will. Thank you, Meyer. I don't think there's anything huge in that. I think the preferred customers could have more products. Obviously, it's a rate to risk that we're looking at. It could be stickier with other products that come with us. And really, frequency has been trending down for the last 50 years or 60 years. I'm not sure what stable frequency means because it's been so oddly volatile over the last four years. But -- and also, we do want to write any business that we can. Sam Sands writes Robinsons [ph] as long as we reach our target profit margin. So we're fully open for business for any consumer as long as we can make that target profit margins. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. I'll add in. I mean, I think it's hard because different competitors do it differently. Some are growing and have Property, but not on their own paper. Some of our competitors have sort of derisked before us and are in a position then to grow, but not necessarily in the places that have the volatile weather. And some are bundled, I mean, a lot, when you look at captive agencies are really sticky because they're bundled for a long time. That eventually, that's where we want to be able to be, whether the home is on our paper or on the sort of stable group of carriers we work with. We want to make sure that that broad coverage, just be where, when, and how customers want to shop. And that's why we developed, we obviously want to bundle more, but that bundle has to be profitable and -- but we want to make sure that we can, when people call in, give them what they need, whether it's on with our Home Quote Explorer, our Auto Quote Explorer, or our Business Quote Explorer. And sometimes, hopefully it's with us, but if not, we'll take care of them with customers or I should say businesses that we partner with. So the competitive environment we look to, but we really are playing our own game here, especially with Property as we evolve and mature. And you're right, we don't have the same probably percentage market share. Clearly we don't, but we want to take that slowly so that we make prudent decisions for the long-term of the firm."

            "name": "Patrick Callahan",
            "content": "Sure. We have an aligned national commission structure that we have in place for either our Property agents, so those with the full suite of products or those without access to our Property products. And those matrices are designed to reward higher quality business and greater volume of business. And over time, what we see is agents respond well to understanding what the targets are, understanding how the framework works and understanding how their behaviors and the actions allocating different business to Progressive can result in better compensation for their agencies. Now, Tricia mentioned on the quality side of things, as we pivot and start to invest more to turn the Property business around, there are tactics within the agency channel that will ensure that agents know they have to be bundling business with us, they have to write with our underwriting guidelines in mind and we measure that through underwriting cancel rates, and they have to produce a certain amount of volume to retain their Property appointment with us. And we think those three in combination with a very clear, transparent national compensation plan, agents understand what we're offering, how we fit in their agencies, and ultimately, how we can mutually benefit by producing high quality, profitable business. Yeah. The only thing that I would add is... ... spending more. The only thing I would add is that segmentation matters. So spending more isn't necessarily going to drive the outcome folks desire. It's spending it smartly and understanding the lifetime value of the customer and the media that we use to reach those customers. So we think given our scale and given the analytics we have in place, we are creating segmentation in the media world like we have in the product segmentation space. And that segmentation enables us to understand where to spend more efficiently based on who we're able to acquire and it's not just about spending more overall, it's spending it in the right places. Additionally, I think when you see what we do on the product segmentation side, we do think that creating adverse selection for our competitors through matching rate to risk more precisely does inflate their trend different than ours over time and that synthetic trend we think requires them over time to potentially have to adjust rates differently than we have. So we're pretty confident that at this point. We are efficient in our spend. And as Tricia mentioned, we monitor it extremely closely and we'll adjust as needed over time, but we play our game and we managed our economics and they look good at this point. Yeah. And I would say that the growth that we're seeing wasn't expected earlier in the year. So we knew we had shields up when we were slowing the business down to deliver 2023 calendar year profitability and as we've reduced some of those verification tactics and gotten, frankly, more competitive with billing options, et cetera, we have seen, as you see in the reports, outsized growth. So I don't think we entered the year saying we think we can produce this level of profit and growth on a significantly extended period. So right now you see we've taken rates down a small amount in a number of states. And as John mentioned, our product managers constantly evolve that competitive environment to see how much ambient shopping there is, how efficient our media spend is and as we come into kind of the slower shopping period of the year, we'll be monitoring our spend and our rate level to make sure we can grow as fast as our staffing levels and service levels enable us to. So we've got some really high comps coming into next year and feel great about how we're closing out this year. But I don't -- I think the growth is the piece of the ordered pair that was outperforming this year and it wasn't certainly in our plan at the outset to be able to capture as much growth as we have. But with competitors raising rates and restricting access to new business, your media becomes really efficient when there's not a lot of people competing for the clicks or in market with competitive rates for the shoppers."

The way we operationalize in the marketplace, our objectives there is for our product managers and they are managing at the state and product level and they are assessing the competitive landscape where we sit by segment, they understand elasticity by channel and by locale. And they're making the calls that level to decide what we should be doing with price. Obviously the 96% is the objective, but to the extent we can manage and grow a lot beneath that, the product managers are going to make those calls. So I think when you look at our performance over time, you see the aggregate of all those decisions at the local level. So I think that I understand the questions, but I think understanding how we operationalize that in the marketplace is really important to understand our model. No. I think that's good. Thanks."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks very much. As you've been seeing over the last, throughout the course of the last few years, but certainly over the last few months, there's been quite a lot of volatility in interest rates, especially as we headed towards the election and the Fed started cutting rates. For us, as you know, we have a relatively short duration portfolio, just a little bit over three years. And so the two things that are going to really adjust the new money yields versus the book yields would be the underlying level of interest rates, which has risen quite significantly since the end of the third quarter. And then as well as we allocate money into and out of cash and treasuries into other risk products. Right now we have a relatively conservative allocation. And so if we were to shift that, that would increase book yields over time. But obviously the underlying movement in interest rates as -- will likely increase prospective book yields if they were to maintain around this level. But I would just want to point out that for Progressive, the driving force in our investment strategy is a total rate of return strategy. So the book yield is an output of the decisions we make. But for us, we're really looking to drive the strongest total return over the longer term. Does that answer your question?"

These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Pat?\nPat Callahan: Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Pat Callahan, Personal Lines, President, and I'm pleased to introduce the topic of today's presentation, direct acquisition. Our vision is to become consumers, agents and business owners, number one destination for insurance and other financial needs. To achieve that vision, we strive to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for their insurance and to optimize our experiences to meet the needs of individual consumers. A foundational element of this optimization is to understand the differences between our agency and direct channel customers. Agency customers often choose that channel, because they value the professional local counsel, ease of shopping, breadth and depth of product and carrier options available through independent agents. These customers often have more complex insurance needs. And as such, the expertise provided by an agent coupled with the personal relationship agents build with their customers gives the customer peace of mind. The direct channel customer frequently places higher value on the convenience and ease of access afforded through self-service 24/7 shopping and servicing. They often have less complex needs and feel comfortable making insurance decisions after educating themselves through the tools that we provide online, supplemented by the knowledge of our trained and licensed direct consultants. The customers, segmentation and economics of these two auto insurance distribution channels are fundamentally different, which is why we've developed, deployed and optimized distinct personal auto products for each channel. The result of these distinct products is not necessarily higher or lower rates in one channel versus the other, as we target similar combined ratios. But instead, delivers products that better aligns our rates with the different indemnity and expense characteristics of each channel. There are three primary distribution channels for U.S. auto insurance; captive agents, independent agents, and direct-to-consumer. We write through both independent agents where we're the market share leader and through direct where we're the number two writer, enjoying over 25% and growing market share. The independent agency and direct channels make up the majority of the U.S. personal auto insurance market and continue to grow faster than the captive market. The current hard market has distorted some long-term channel trends as certain large competitors in these channels either shrink significantly or grow rapidly amid large underwriting losses. These dynamics have presented an opportunity for us as prospects have been released to the market and rate increases from less well segmented carriers have driven competitors to be adversely selected. On the right side of the screen, you'll note just how critical our dual-channel strategy has been to achieving our continued market share growth. But today, we're going to spend time focusing on what drives our success in the direct channel. Insurance is a trust-based business and we build that trust and take share from competitors within the direct channel through the strength of our brand, the power of our segmentation, the breadth of our media presence, and the experiences we deliver to our customers. Our presentation will focus on two aspects of the direct channel; media and customer experience. We think about direct customer acquisition has a funnel with a virtuous cycle, similar to what we've previously shared from a product segmentation perspective. Media sits at the top of this funnel, where our online presence and award-winning advertising is deployed and optimized by our world-class in-house media team. Our advertising delivers billions of impressions every year, which in turn bring more than 100 million visitors to progressive.com annually. The experience on progressive.com turns those initial touches into tens of millions of quotes and ultimately, millions of sales annually. As we put more prospects through our funnel, we obtained the data to optimize the experience which in turn improves the media economics at the top of the funnel, which again, leads to further optimization. Our scale means this cycle is difficult for competitors to replicate, which has helped to continue to feed our market share growth. Today, our direct media business leader, Jay VanAntwerp, a 20-year progressive employee will provide insights on how we optimize our media spend and why investors should feel confident that when we invest a dollar in media, it's a dollar well spent. After Jay, Dave Krew, our acquisition experience business leader will join us. Dave has led our acquisition experience team for 12 of his 34-year progressive tenure. He will walk us through how progressive.com has evolved from a basic Web 1.0 site back in the 1990s to become the number one ranked insurance website today. And, how his team enables us to continue to increase the complexity of our rating and our products, while simultaneously improving yield through our acquisition funnel. Thanks again for joining us today, and I will now hand it over to Jay. Jay?\nJay VanAntwerp: Thanks Pat. Today, I want to begin by talking about our Media Group and why we believe it is a competitive advantage for Progressive that would be incredibly challenging for our competitors to replicate in the near to medium terms. One of the distinct things about Progressive is that we buy almost all of our media using an in-house team. The media channels we buy include mass media like TV and radio, programmatic display, paid social media, direct mail and paid search. Virtually any type of advertising or demand generation that is purchased, our media team buys. We believe that this makes us unique, not just in the insurance industry, but advertising industry overall. This is not a new development. The decision to buy media in-house was made almost at the very beginning of our efforts in the direct channel in the mid-1990s. At that time, our demand generation efforts were focused on television and direct mail. But since then, our Media Group has evolved with the media landscape. As digital channels like programmatic display and paid social media have become more prominent, our media team has given appropriate focus to those areas. And using Progressive's risk learn, grow philosophy, we develop viewpoints on how to buy those media types efficiently. So our current capabilities are the result of an evolution of over three decades. Given how long we have been doing this and how ingrained the Media Group is within the company, it would be very challenging to assemble a team from scratch that would be able to efficiently deploy spend in all media channels and at our current scale. What are some of the advantages that having an in-house team gives us? Our focus relative to an external agency is very important. We focus on one brand and one small set of products. This allows for a level specialization that an external agency would be challenged to match. We are able to leverage one of Progressive's core strengths, which is analytics. Progressive has a very strong history and track record of analytical innovation. We draw on those capabilities and building our analytical team. Another advantage our in-house team has over an external agency is product knowledge. Our analysts typically come from other areas of the company. They understand our product. They understand the dynamics of the auto insurance market. They're able to bring the insurance context to how they look at media in a way that no external agency would be able to replicate. If you combine the focus with the analytics, the result is custom models built specifically for Progressive using first-party data we would never make available to an external third-party. All of our models are proprietary, using our data to evaluate only our brand and the products that we sell as opposed to a one-size-fits-all model for multiple clients that you might get using an external agency. This has been incredibly impactful. We have leveraged our analytical horsepower and first-party data to dig into all of our spend and determine the relative efficiency and lifetime value of all the different media channels. This then gives us a guide for the optimal places to spend more when adding budget and when reducing the budget, so we can optimize for Progressive specific needs. Progressive is a leader in segmentation for auto insurance pricing, it is similarly powerful when we bring these skills to how we buy media. Another advantage is the ability to quickly flex the budget. Our budget is flexible within controls, which I will talk about later in the presentation. We are willing to increase the budget if there is efficient opportunity and available margin within our calendar year 1996 combined ratio target to fund the additional spend. Also, if there is a need to reduce the expense ratio in order to hit our target 1996, we can do that quickly as well. Our analytics show us how to optimize sales, both when adding and when cutting. Furthermore, we are able to flex our budget up and down extremely quickly. Another advantage is that we have aligned incentives. Like other progressive employees, our media teams on our gainshare annual bonus program. So they benefit from the success of Progressive in a way that a media agency that is compensated on commission wouldn't. A media agency is primarily incented to encourage clients to spend more on media in order to increase commissions. Our media team is focused on the core strategies of Progressive, primarily profitable growth. We also have lower overhead costs than an equivalent program that relies on external media agencies. So not only are we buying the media smarter, but we are also doing it at a lower cost. A 5% commission on $2 billion in spend which is about what we spent at our peak in 2020 would be $100 million. Our team is less than 100 people with total annual cost for this team this team considerably lower than $100 million. Finally, and really cannot be overstated. Our team has very strong relationships with in Progressive that no external agency would be able to develop. While we work closely with our marketing team in the way most agencies would. We also work directly with state product managers and general managers as well as many other areas of the business. We also have a very firm understanding of the business that allows us to credibly show how what we do in the Media Group benefits Progressive. As I talk more about some of the accomplishments of the last decade, I think it would be unlikely that an outside agency would have been able to make the case to be as aggressive as we were leading up to our peak spend in 2020 and could an outside agency move as quickly to make cuts as we did in 2023. To summarize, we feel that our Media Group and the capabilities that we have built over 30 years have contributed greatly to Progressive success. I will talk specifically about the last decade and how we have been able to support Progressive's goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a '96. Before talking about progressive specific spend over the last decade, it is worth providing context about insurance industry ad spend over the last 30 years because it has shifted significantly over time. Progressive Direct and other directors became more aggressive in the mid-1990s, with the emergence of the direct-to-consumer business model for auto insurance. Which spurred strong growth in insurance and advertising spend. From 1996 to 2003, and there was 10% compound annual growth in Media spend. This is a high rate of growth, and yet that rate of growth increased about 50% from 2003 to 2011, with the compound annual growth rate rising to 15%. Between 2011 and 2017, industry ad spend slowed to only 2%, largely driven by agency distributed companies whose economic models didn't allow them to keep pace with the direct-to-consumer companies who continue to have double-digit growth rates during this time period. Starting in 2017, growth in advertising ramped up again from 2017 to 2021, the industry compound annual growth increased five times from the previous period to 10%. We will talk about some of the dynamics happening at that time that may have spurred the next round of growth. But there is a strong argument to be made that Progressive was the catalyst as we started spending more at this time and competitors followed suit. As we know, overall industry profitability issues in 2022 and 2023 led to a contraction in ad spend as the compound annual growth rate for those two years was negative 20%. That was the overall industry landscape. Now, let's talk about Progressive specifically. Prior to 2017, Progressive's media spend was under $700 million and we are consistently around 10% of total industry spend. In 2015 and 2016, we really hit our stride in using analytics to generate insights for how to buy media more efficiently. We were able to come up with a common metric between all media types that allowed us to better evaluate where our spend was efficient and where it wasn't. Also during this time, we were coming out of a hard market. Similar to today, we reacted in advance of the industry and aggressively raised rates, such that our loss ratios were trending below our '96 combined ratio target. As such, we had available margin to fund a higher level of spend as a percentage of premium, while keeping our combined ratio below '96. Starting in 2017 and continuing for the next three years, we were able to operationalize the advances in media efficiency, which allowed us to spend significantly more while still maintaining our target economics with the increased spend funded by available margin. We went from $650 million in spend in 2016 to almost $2 billion in 2020, a tripling in just four years. You will remember from earlier slides, that during that four-year period, there was also an increase in industry spend, which I hypothesized was spurred by our increase in spend. When we started to spend more, competitors noticed and also began spending more. This resulted in that period of growth from 2017 to 2021 for the industry. While our competitors did spend more during that time, we increased our media spend much faster than the industry. Resulting in an increase in our percentage of total industry spend from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2020. To summarize, we tripled our spend in four years and almost doubled our share of the industry spend. When our losses are higher than target, we look to cut expenses with the goal of meeting our '96 combined ratio target until we have adequate rate. One of the largest and most flexible ways we can control our combined ratio is through the media budget. As severity trends rapidly steepened starting in 2021. We cut the Progressive media budget three years in a row from 2021 through 2023. Prior to this period, going back 30 years, we had never cut the budget two years in a row. So this was an unprecedented time as was the increasing size of the cuts. We went from almost $2 billion of media spend in 2020 to about $1.3 billion in 2023. These cuts happened at a time when the overall industry was cutting as well. So even with the significant cuts, the statutory data shows that we were the biggest vendor in industry in 2022 and 2023. And our share of the overall spend within the industry was almost flat. Going from 20% of spend in 2020 to 19% in 2023. All of these dynamics would have been impossible to manage without the capabilities of our in-house team. Our insights, analytics and relationships with the business allowed us to make the case for the increase in spend up to 2020 and then quickly cut significant amounts particularly in 2023 to support the overall company goal of hitting a '96. I've talked about the efficiency of our spend, but have not necessarily defined what that means. We do have a number of controls on our spend. The primary one is that our cost per sale has to be at or below our target acquisition cost. If that is the case, then we would say that the spend is beneficial. Cost per sale is our total acquisition costs divided by direct sales. Tamini is the largest part of our total acquisition costs. Other costs include the expenses related to running our call centers, development of our creative, maintaining and improving our online quote experience, the compensation of our marketing and media groups, among other things. Targeted acquisition cost is how much we charge customers for acquisition expenses over the life of their policy plus margin adequacy. It's the amount we price into the policy for acquisition. This amount is adjusted up or down based on where our margin is relative to targets. We need to make sure that the sales we are bringing in are at or below the acquisition expenses we price into our policies. That's the primary control in our spend, but there are others. Another constraint is that the direct auto lifetime combined ratio has to be at or below 96, meaning we have to be confident that that the new business we are writing in a state is going to meet our profitability target over the life of the policy. As we talked about in our second quarter 2023 Investor Relations call, direct channel policy acquisition costs are expensed in the first term of the policy and every subsequent term of the policy is collecting the premium necessary to cover the initial acquisition expense. If the acquisition expense is too high, such that the premium collected over the average lifetime does not cover initial acquisition expense, indemnity expense and other expenses, we shouldn't be spending money to acquire those policies. We need to be able to service our customers well. This is primarily for claims. There are times when the growth in the state is greater than our claims staffing can keep up with. So we will turn media off in order to slow demand and allow our staffing to catch up. Another constraint is our focus on achieving an aggregate company-wide calendar year combined ratio at or below a 96. We will not spend additional media dollars if our calendar year 96 target is under threat. Even if there may be opportunities for efficient media spend. And the final control on our spend is an efficient incremental cost per sale. That is a relatively new constraint. Incremental cost per sale is our measure of whether our spend is bringing in a quote or a sale that is over and above the ambient shopping rate. We are able to are able to measure that at a pretty granular level. And we are able to use that metric to evaluate efficiency within a channel as well as between channels. This chart shows the relativity of actual cost per sale versus the target acquisition cost. We want this metric to be at or below zero. At zero, it would mean that our actual acquisition cost is equal to our target acquisition cost. You can see that even during the run-up in spend from 2016 to 2020, that we kept cost per sale below the target in some years by as much as 15%. Even as we deployed three times the level of spend, we brought in enough sales to hit our target economics and for that extra spend to be completely paid for with the premium that was generated. 2023 was certainly an outlier given the size of the cuts. When we cut spend, we cut the least efficient areas first. After the cuts in 2023, we were left with only the most efficient spend as well as a relatively high level of ambient shopping due to the hard market. So cost per sale was significantly below the target acquisition cost in 2023. Even with a significant rise in spend 2024, the ratio has increased, but is still well below our targets. This means that so far in 2024, we are adding policies very efficiently. And this is true for two reasons. First, year-to-date, many of our competitors have remained at depressed levels of media spend. This means that we are able to get a large amount of media impressions for less. Additionally, when those impressions turn into quotes, we're converting them at a good pace, suggesting cost competitiveness. Another view of efficiency is to look at the upfront acquisition expenses as a percentage of the lifetime earned premium that is expected from the sales. From 2016 to 2020, our acquisition expenses as a percentage of premium went up, but stayed in the 7% to 7.5% range. As with the cost per sale versus target acquisition cost, this metric did fall as we made cuts in 2023 and is up in in 2024 as we've increased spend. Again, this suggests that 2024, even as we have significantly increased our media spend, we're still bringing in prospects at very high efficiency. We have shown cost per sale versus target acquisition cost in order to illustrate that even with the run-up in spend, we hit our target economics. This chart illustrates the benefit that we got from increased spend a little more clearly. This chart shows an index of media spend anchored to 2015 as a 1.0 on the horizontal axis and an index of direct auto sales anchored to 2015 on the vertical axis. Each dot represents a different year.You can see that even with the increase in spend, we were able to increase sales commensurately. As with the other charts, 2023 is an outlier. In previous calls, we were often asked about ambient shopping and how we gauge it. The 2023 number is a clear indication of the elevated amount of ambient shopping last year. Despite spending below 2019 levels, we sold more direct new policies than in any year in our history. This is because rates were rising across the industry, prompting customers to shop at and eventually purchase from Progressive. We have talked about how the budget cuts were a key tactic in helping Progressive hit the 1996 [ph] combined ratio in 2023. This chart shows acquisition expenses as a percentage of direct auto earned premium. You can see the increase in acquisition expense as a percentage of earned premium going from under 9% in in 2016 to almost 13% 2020. I had mentioned before that one of the keys to our ability to increase the spend the way that we did was available margin to be able to pay for the extra spend, while still hitting profit targets. As we reduce spend starting in 2021, the acquisition expense ratio dropped from 13% to just over 6% in 2023. This cut reduced the company-wide combined ratio by about 2.8 points in 2023 and was a big factor in our ability to exceed our 1996 calendar year target. Year-to-date 2024 we have increased spend, so now our acquisition expense ratio is back to about 10%. Note that the 2024 ratio on the chart is a year-to-date number. The first quarter acquisition expense ratio was below that of the second quarter. As margins continue to be strong, we will look for opportunities to grow the business as much as possible. While we only get statutory spend data annually, we do have some ways to gauge Progressive spend in relation to the rest of the industry during the year. There are a number of third-parties that provide a measure of what individual competitors are spending in select media channels. This chart shows an index created using iSpot data as a proxy for year-to-date TV spend and SensorTower's Pathmatics data as a proxy for year-to-date programmatic display and paid social media spend. We have set the Progressive spend at a 1.0 index and show the next four largest spenders in the insurance industry. You can see that based on this data, Progressive Media spending is considerably higher than others. Though this is only a partial picture of all the advertising done in the industry, it does provide a useful data point suggesting Progressive is outspending competitors by a significant margin. That increased spend is paying off as we are delivering the necessary sales to pay for that spend. This chart of spend versus sales is the same as the one I just showed, but each dot represents only the first half of year. You can see that 2024 is above the historic trend line with record spend and record sales. This chart suggests we are getting a strong return on our media spend to date. In conclusion, Progressive's in-house media team is a unique competitive advantage that has driven significant value for Progressive since the inception of the direct business. In the last decade, the media team has been instrumental in increasing media spend efficiently, which has resulted in greater market share. This team also plays a huge role in managing to our 1996 combined ratio through expense management and cutting spend to support the goal of a company-wide 1996 combined ratio. Today, the team is laser focused on profitable growth and is deploying record spend amounts in the first half of 2024, and this has produced the largest first half direct sales volume in our history. While we focus on the relationship between sales and media spend as a measure of efficiency, it is important to point out that many other areas of the company work in conjunction with our media team to deliver sales. Everything from the award-winning creative produced by our marketing team to industry-leading product and pricing make our jobs easier. Another key area is the team that received the online and we generate at the top of the funnel and converts it into quotes and sales. That team is the direct acquisition experience team, which has ownership of progressive.com and the online quote funnel. In the same way that the media team has evolved over decades, the acquisition experience team has been a competitive advantage for Progressive since we sold our first policy online over 25 years ago. My colleague, Dave Krew, leads that group and is going to speak to their part in the funnel. Dave?\nDave Krew: Thanks, Jay. Once Jay and his team get prospects to engage with Progressive, the direct acquisition experience team works to turn digital touches into productive experiences for the consumer and then profit for Progressive. My team is focused on progressive.com and our personal lines auto and recreation aligns direct sales funnels. There are parallel roles that focus on property and commercial lines applying similar concepts. Our goal is to deliver incremental lifetime underwriting profit each year by optimizing our digital experiences and periodically delivering breakthrough step functions in the evolving digital education, quote and purchase process. The term lifetime underwriting profit or LUP for short refers to the sum of expected profit dollars generated from the incremental sales we produce. I'll touch more on why that's important later. To do what we do requires very close collaboration with adjacent organizations; IT, product, CRM and marketing in particular. It also requires a diverse set of subject matter experts on our central team. We work to connect the dots between deep insurance knowledge, the digital agency mindset, data analytics, data science and process management. Another way to say this is a real balance of right and left brain disciplines come together. And in my opinion, that's where the value has had. Like the media team, we've been at this for several decades. Let's start with the origin story. There have been a number of digital first in our history. We are online in 1995 and started quoting and selling online soon thereafter. We started planning for scale, had segmented operational data and tracked results all before the turn of the century and 15-plus years prior to the coining of the term insurtech. Taking the time line a bit further and deeper, as I said, we were online in 1995. We first showed comparison rates online in 1996, sold our first fully digital auto policy in 1997 and expanded our online footprint from auto to recreational lines in 1999. As we grew, we set out to innovate in the user experience space with several end market innovations, such as Name Your Price. We also invested in our mobile quoting capabilities. Starting in 2017, we began to leverage advanced technologies to personalized user experience and increased funnel throughput. We also continued investing in other value-adding educational content and a chatbot. Which leads us to today selling millions of policies untouched by human hands each year plus a substantial number of digital-assisted sales that quote online and purchase over the phone. While over half of those digital sales happen on mobile devices. Here's a look at today's digital funnel. There are over 100 million visits to progressive.com annually. These leads to tens of millions of quote starts and ultimately, millions of digital sales. The screen shots on the right of the slide are representative way points as a prospect navigates from our homepage into an auto quote in this case, and ultimately a purchase. A 1% movement in throughput generally contributes sales lift that equates to tens of millions profit dollars. To that end, we invest significant talent and resources in the user experience, technology and optimization. These incremental sales are high margin given the media team already got the prospects in door. To be clear, we often count sales for ease of communication, but the underlying analysis of Lyft generally contemplates contribution of lifetime underwriting profit or LUP as noted earlier, given all the policies are not the same and trade-offs can present themselves. Optimizing motorcycle versus auto lift in a multiproduct experience is one example of such a LUP based tradeoff. I'll now transition from our digital history and scale to some of the how of what we do. Our digital experience is in effect, the front end of our highly segmented product. Our product continues to evolve and move faster, which is a very good thing but using the metaphor on the slide requires our digital customer acquisition train to stay sync with an accelerating product train. Our product requires a complex interview for infrequent transaction with many options. We have decades of experience delivering an accurate online quote and optimizing the user experience simultaneously. Along the way, we've evolved a set of tactics and principles that help us make informed trade-offs. We often run pilots ahead of product changes to assess the best way to gather a given rating input. And by best, we mean most accurate and easiest for the consumer. We've also evolved a living analytic framework to assess and target abandoned points as our user experience and product evolve together. As stated a bit earlier, there is much value to be had at the interface of deep insurance knowledge and deep user experience knowledge. To be clear, the fastest quote is not our goal. Optimal use of the consumer's time is. An instant or quick quote generally implies assumptions in downstream rework. Not to say we don't experiment, in fact, we have a motorcycle quick quote pilot in market in several states as we speak, as well as embedded rates with automotive and financial partners. But the science needs to include rate accuracy in a total end-to-end look at the customer experience from quote to purchase to onboarding. Regarding that science, our scale affords lots of data to optimize new experiences via A/B testing. As part of that testing, we look for sales and LUP [ph] lift, as one might expect, and also come full circle to look at the impact of user experience on product mix. How you ask and display the question can matter. To conclude this slide, keeping up with a fast-moving product, while simultaneously improving user experience and sales throughput necessitates that we have deep connections and frequent collaboration with our product and IT partners. Another way to state our objective function is to stay on and ultimately stretch the efficient frontier of customer ease and segmentation fidelity. As the final topic in our acquisition experience section, I'll touch on our approach to personalization and the digital funnel. We know that delivering the right content to the right consumer in the right context drive substantial value. As I pointed out before, we have been delivering personalized content to enhance customer experience and drive increased sales associated LUP since 2017 We've built a number of points of user experience personalization throughout our digital funnel. Personalization use cases have led to cumulative benefits in the hundreds of millions of dollars proven via A/B tests in the marketplace. Before breaking down our approach to real-time digital personalization on the next slide, I'll also mention another point of advanced technology deployment. Since 2018, our quoting and progressive.com chatbots have delivered millions of conversations and replaced millions of dollars of human support cost. While I won't get into detail on the specifics since this is a fast-moving space that provides real competitive advantage, I'll break down our approach. Delivering personalization at scale in a digital sales funnel in real time requires a set of balanced capabilities. We continue to evolve our capability set along four dimensions. Every year, we work to make sure we advance along each of four key elements, represented on what we call the personalization wheel. While not in a particular order, I'll start with context data. We continue to evolve the data we can access in a real-time digital funnel to drive decisions. We take great care around annuity and privacy as we use the data to drive better user experience. Working clockwise on the wheel, we come to content. Delivering the right content to the right consumer in right context is at the heart of our digital personalization work. We constantly work to add new use cases to our road maps, think stars on the prior slide. A close connection with the marketing team is important here. Next is Decision Science. We continue to add new models and evolve existing ones. Context data is the input, a content decision is the output. Last and absolutely not least, is the delivery system. We need an infrastructure that delivers the content decision and the content itself in milliseconds where the value of optimized content is lost. We also need a nimble environment for our data scientists and engineers to test and evolve new models. We have a strong partnership with our IT team to ensure we leverage and influence the latest enterprise-wide developments, while meeting more current in-market objectives. We work advance on all four of these dimensions each year as a means to drive a road map of short, medium and longer-term end-market tests and ultimately, sales and LUP lift. That was a very brief overview of our direct acquisition experience world. To summarize, we've been at digital sales funnel growth and optimization for a very long time. We have a lot of data that we learn from and advance in progressive fashion. A tight coupling with product is not only necessary, but we believe a source of significant advantage that Insurtech startups will likely never have. We continue to advance our personalization capability set in this space. And last but not least, we've been evolving at the junction of insurance and technology for decades to help fuel the direct customer acquisition virtuous cycle.\nDoug Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Jay VanAntwerp and Dave Krew, who are available to answer questions about the presentation. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. Marvin will...\nOperator: Our firs question comes from the line of Bob Jian Huang of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBob Jian Huang : Hey, good morning. I'm trying -- so first question is, I'm trying to tie out several quarter worth of presentations here. So first of all, you're signing up probably, call it, 2 million new auto policies this year-to-date so far. And even if I assume there's no additional new auto policies that is still a record. So if we think about from that perspective and typically, first year, because of acquisition costs is because of estimates, your -- that policy cohorts combined ratio should be elevated. And if we go out into 2025 and beyond, despite the fact having already a very efficient acquisition cost, shouldn't your -- that policy cohorts combined ratio to be relatively low. So consequently, give you a lot of more flexibility on the combined ratio side to acquire additional customers. Is that the right way to think about this? If not, like how should I think about just essentially the artificially low combined ratio now? And then how far is that going to evolve going forward?\nTricia Griffith : Thanks, Bob. And yes, you're exactly right, with 2 million additional auto policies and 2.6 million additional policies overall for the company, there's so many inputs that go into a combined ratio that it's hard to discern exactly how the future will go. But here's what I would say. We're very efficient, and there's been a lot of ambient shopping, as you've seen in our presentations and I've written about we've talked about. And so we're able to have our cost per sell well below our targeted acquisition cost. Now the fact is we want even more growth. So we want to grow from a premium perspective, but I've talked a lot about my preferred -- our preferred method of growth is a unit of growth. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're sitting in really great position. So we will spend more if we think we can continue to grow policies units because, frankly, our premium kind of goes up and down, as you've seen in the last four years based on our trends. It's been a high inflationary trend that's abating, which is great for our customers. So while I'm not going to be able signal what our combined ratio will be, know that we're going to spend as much as we can from a media perspective if we think we can get it in an efficient cost with, again, calendar year and lifetime 1916, we're going to continue to drive down non-acquisition expense ratios, we\u2019re going to continue to work on our accuracy and efficiency as well as customer service and work environment, our claims organization, which we have seen just a lot of really great momentum as we've gotten staffed and more tenure in there, and we're going to continue to evolve our brand. So if you look at that, I can't tell you in your model what to put in for our combined ratio, but know that we're looking at all levers at all times, but we feel like we are finally in a really good position to be able to do what we've always said we wanted to do and take small bites of the apple and continue to grow. And whether that's small bite a little bit upward a little bit downward, really be in a position to grow and take even more market share than we've taken in the first half of this year.\nBob Jian Huang: Great. Really appreciate that answer. Thank you. My second question revolves around investment income and the way competitive environment is evolving. So, obviously, last few years, a lot of insurers we're subsidizing their underwriting with investment income to offset the inflationary environment. As we think about the growth prospects going forward and interest rate volatility going forward, if interest rates were to come down, if equity market remains volatile, does that help you on the broader competitive environment given that some of your key competitors tend to guide as far as an ROE rather than an underwriting combined ratio. Is there a way to think about that from a broader dynamic investment -- as that broader competitive dynamics?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. We really try to separate the operational with our capital management. So, obviously, our net investment income has improved because we've had some bonds maturing, we have a lot of money from the operations, so we can put that into bonds with higher yields. But really our job, at the Progressive Capital Management, we actually just got back from a business review last week is to protect balance sheet. We're going to continue to grow as fast as we can. We're not going to change the dynamics of our overall original [ph] objectives that we've had since 1971 probably before that, but that is to grow as fast as we can at a 1996 combined ratio, or making at least $0.04 of underwriting profit, but making sure that we take care of our customers. So we look at the competition and competitors have just different models. We're going to continue to have the motto we have had for a long time because we think it's a winning one.\nBob Jian Huang: Great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, just given the ramp-up in ad spend that we've seen this year, are you guys doing this with the expectation that the year-over-year PIF gains that you guys see in the second half of the year will accelerate versus the first half of the year. When we think about relative to that $1.9 million that we've seen added through June?\nTricia Griffith: We sure hope so, Elyse. We're going to continue that. I would say if you -- if there's ever a signal of our confidence in our rates, it's based on what we're spending on our media. So you'll see that we're pretty confident what a difference a year makes. But our intentions are to continue on this path and really leverage where we're at from a competitive perspective, both a media and brand perspective, competitive prices, and we're going to hopefully continue that throughout 2024 and beyond.\nElyse Greenspan: And then maybe my second question is a follow-up on that, right? When you guys in the slides talking about competitors returning advertising. Do you have -- how do you view the efficient, I guess, advertising opportunities today relative to the past year?\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I think we're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping and there are some people, there's some -- some of our competitors that are still getting a fair amount of rate, which will continue to have shopping as we talked about, both with our of prospects and conversion. So, we feel really great about where at different companies, of course, measure it differently. And I think really the secret sauce is what Dave and Jay talked about. And that is something that we've worked on not for a year, not for two years, for decades and is built upon each other, and then, of course, working with our product group, our claims group, our marketing group that's really the special secret sauce. So, now, we feel really great about the efficiency. And we feel, like I said, even more importantly, great about having the right rates on the street. Now, again, that -- I can change a little bit here and there, but it's been such a pendulum swing in the last four years, giving $1 billion back to customers and lowering rates during the pandemic and then, of course, the inflation. It's really nice to what we see at this point in time just some stability, which our customers deserve and just tweaking it up and down a little bit, and that's really where the fun begins where we really can get competitive on our advertising, our media and, of course, taking care of our customers.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nMike Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Take a step back for the first question, a little higher level, Trish. I guess -- looking at the consumer landscape that's clearly changing, the younger generation, more online, more media, more social media things like that. I guess as you think about how that continues to change, how do you see the overall size of the DTC channel relative to the overall personal market? What percent do you think that's going to be in maybe five, 10 years down the road? And part of that I ask is we're seeing clearly more competitors try to cut into this, whether it's small new entrants or even some pretty big traditional agency competitors of yours that are trying to switch over to direct. And so if you can comment on how difficult you think that is to get into this market, given you guys have been quite successful for decades? Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Yes, I mean I think that the generation, I think I've shared with you before, I have six children that everyone wants to buy online, that makes more sense. It's easy. I remember when we first started prog.com, it was called something else is called Auto Pro. No one thought anyone would ever buy auto insurance online, and we made a bet. And it's difficult. And it was an uphill battle. It was an expensive battle, it took us 10 years before we made money. As if you go back into this presentation, you look at what Dave Krew said, we were in SureTec before that it was never coined a name. So, I think we feel pretty proud that we're going to continue to innovate. That's so important in our DNA. So, we're going to continue with the integrated marketing campaigns. I think for us, it's really about choice for consumers. So, I am still an agency customer. It works for me, it doesn't work for my children. So, I think to answer your question, it's hard to get into, but even as we watch the competition, it really boils down to competitors and all of us making sure that we have the right choices for our consumers. And that's really where we want to be. And we believe that we can compete really effectively in both the direct and agency channel, and we have been.\nMike Phillips: Okay. Thank you. This is a little more specific to your recent Q. You mentioned a lot about growth in renters. And I guess I'm curious, is there anything concerted effort on your part that's caused that? Or where is that coming from? And are there growth opportunities in your auto that come from that growth in renters? And are there things in the renters customer base that you can learn that would make the auto growth a little bit more profitable? Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean I think renters is oftentimes required, we have an easy, really quote flow for renters. We do like to have the auto renters bundled. We also know that renters can often turn into homeowners. And of course, we have to make sure that those homes are ones that fit our risk profile as we move forward and de-risk that book a little bit. But yeah, any time we see that bundle happen, whether it's auto and renters and then any other product you add that also causes stickiness, and that's really where the rubber meets the road is making sure that consumers we have what they need and when we do, they stay for a long time. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. So for the first question, I'm going to focus on Jay's staffing comment. And Jay, during your portion of the presentation, I think you mentioned that there are times when your staffing in certain geographies aren't up to the speed of growth and so you dialed back advertising -- so I guess just some questions around that. How many times has this happened? Has there been specific geographies where this has been a challenge and maybe on a broader base just about some of your higher strategies to offset what you're reporting substantial growth in presumably a tight labor market?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. A great question, Greg. Let me take that one. It rarely happens, but we watch it closely, mainly because we talk about growing as fast as we can at or below a '96 if we can take care of our customers. I recall one time I'll get the year wrong but it was early 2000s. We were growing a lot. And I remember specifically, we had to tell the state of Texas that we had to slow down. So we had to slow down growth there. So, that obviously is embedded in me. I wasn't even in the role. But having been in the claims role, you work closely, and I know our claims President works closely with Pat and his group to say, okay, here's where we're adequately staffed. And also the great part about now having the ability to have some hybrid work is you can shift work to different states. So you can -- if we are a little bit behind in staffing in one state, we could -- and a little bit above in the other, we can train those people to work that state if we need to. All we're saying and all Jay saying is that if we need to shut off media at a local basis like we did in the last couple of years when we didn't have the right rates on the street, we can do that or if aren't staffed appropriately. Now, right after the pandemic going into 2022, I would say, we had way more turnover than we would normally like in both claims in CRM, we're in a completely different spot right now. In fact, are hiring ahead of need and feel really good and I talked a little bit about making sure that we -- with new reps that we are really accurate and we pay the fair amount and that we're efficient. So that's really where we're going to be able to turn that on now because we feel really great about our staffing tenure, the quality and our accuracy.\nGregory Peters: Okay. I guess for my follow-up question, I'm going to pivot. And as part of the advertising presentation and advertising expense, presentation, you really didn't talk about multilingual strategies, and we don't really see it in the PowerPoint presentation yet the Hispanic community is a growing percentage of the population inside the United States. So I'm just curious if you could spend a minute and talk about how you're approaching your digital advertising and all the other advertising levers and targeting multilingual cohorts of the population.\nTricia Griffith: That is a great question, and we've been working on that for some time. We had a little setback with some litigations in law, law in Colorado. I won't go into the details because it's out there. But it really caused us to pause because it's really difficult for us when we want to do national advertising to control who's seeing in any given state. So we paused on that. Now we have done a couple ads, one in particular, really sweet one. If you go through it, it's a deer talking to the dove and a dad talking to the new driver. And there's some nods obviously, to Latin X [ph], which we think is important. And I totally agree with you. So we have a strategy and a whole team working on our multilingual, a sort of ability to grow. We can grow both in the agency channel, and we have a huge group of what we call Sagora reps [ph] here that handle our Spanish-speaking customers. We believe that this is a big opportunity. Again, we had to pause a little bit because of something that happened in Colorado, but we talk about this a lot. In fact, we're getting an update in one of my upcoming direct report meetings on where we're going with our multilingual strategy.\nGregory Peters: Thank you for the answers.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you, Gregory.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I was listening to Jay's presentation and he said that you made a big bet in advertising. And of course, the industry followed you. And then Tricia, you said that people doubted people would buy auto insurance online, but of course, that they did. I was wondering what was the catalyst change all that, and I want to apply that to homeowners. When do you think there will be a catalyst that people really buy homeowners online, how big do you think the online homeowners' direct-to-consumer market can get -- and maybe do you think we're on the cusp of that change?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. That's several questions. I'll go back to begin with. I think we'll always continue to try to grow in all channels. So we'll use that innovation. I think Jay's big bet on advertising. We had -- we sort of took a decomp and looked at where we were at a long time like go back to like the mid-2000s. And we advertised, we did it well. We had a brand but not solidified. And I think we were able to make a big bet when we had a brand that people recognize that respected, they talked about choice that talked about savings and I actually remember it pretty well because it was not long after I came into this job, I came in mid-2016, we bumped up against the 96 in my first quarter, and shortly thereafter, and I meet with the acquisition teams all the time. Jay and his team came with an approach, and it was brilliant, and I supported it. In fact, Jay often comes to me or through Pat and to me to say we need spend more here, and here's why. And honestly, their group is so spot on. I've never said no. And of course, they've given us a gift of pulling back when we've needed to. So on the direct homeowner side, we're about -- I think about 25% of our business comes into the direct side. So, but think that's Progressive Home and another stable group of carriers. We're going to continue to expand that because we do think people want to buy online. I don't know what the pivot point will be where it's 50-50, like it is in auto, but we're going to continue to invest in that that because we think it's important. And because a home is so much more volatile. And if you get to a density situation can be problematic during storms, we'll continue to work with really solid partners to make sure it benefits them and us as a win for all companies.\nJosh Shanker: And then looking little more on the rate and homeowners. If you look at some of your competitors provide renewal pricing data in that their rate increases are much higher than yours, of course. Some of your pricing is related to your growing faster in non-coastal non-cat states, which is causing your numbers to be lower due to diversification geography. But still, your numbers seem to be lower. Is homeowners nationally being priced adequately not so progressive, but the industry in general? Is the industry overpricing too much, do you think creating an opportunity for Progressive take share here? Or does Progressive -- also need to take some action here to get current with what others are doing?\nTricia Griffith: Well, some of that -- some of those rates you're looking at, like we talked about our growth in renters, which is really much smaller average written premium. We took about 4% in the quarter. And year-to-date, it will be about 10% on a trailing 12% about, 17%. So we've taken quite a lot of a lot of rate, and we've had other non-rate actions that we've taken to derisk our books. I think first things first, we're going to focus on de-risking the book, doing what we've said. We have the 115,000 non-renewals in Florida that we knew were unprofitable. We worked with Florida to have options for those consumers. We're going to continue for us to work on improved segmentation. We have eight states on our new 5.0 product. Get as good at our pricing and our segmentation and really at that surgical level as we have in auto, and that takes some time. We've been working diligently on it. I said in my letter, we're going to be even more aggressive. I think at that point, when the dust clears, we'll be able to take more market share. In the meantime, we are continuing to grow in what we perceive as more nonvolatile states. Weather is always the factor that we have to take into account all the time. But right now, our focus is derisking a property. And then as we feel like we're in a good position, and we do have the right rates. We'll grow in the areas where we think it's most important to grow for the whole health of portfolio.\nJosh Shanker: Very helpful answers.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open..\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. First question just on cost per sale. I'm just curious, as peers have continued to improve their margins year-to-date. Are you expecting increased competition on the cost per sale in the back half of year? And also curious how you anticipate the election will impact costs for advertising?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. To answer the last part, I have no idea. The first part, we might feel some pressure on cost per sale, but it is so much below TAC that we feel really good about the efficiency.\nRobert Cox: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just maybe going to the 10-Q, some of the business mix shift impacting accident frequency. When you think about pricing going forward, how much of this favorable frequency environment are you considering as sustainable versus weather related or other nonrecurring benefits?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. So if you look at our frequency being down about 8%, the majority of that is really \u2013 it's always hard to discern exactly. I would say, the two factors right now for us is our preferred mix and some of the non-rate actions. So we've unwound or continue to unwind the non-reactions. The preferred business, our motto has always been that we want Sam, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We want every customer as long as we can make a lifetime in a calendar year, 1996 combined ratio. So we made to pressure on that. But again, it's really hard to discern and really put together exactly what makes frequency. We watch it closely. As well as we do, obviously, frequency and then react to that accordingly. But like I've said, I feel like we're in such a better position in terms of stability around those trends. And if we can now start to do what we do best, and that is thoroughly look at every product, every state, new and renewal and take a little bit up, a little bit down, a little bit up, a little bit down, make those rates stable for our consumers. That's really the winning proposition for us.\nRobert Cox: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. It\u2019s Jen [ph] on for Meyer. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the rates in the shareholder letter, you mentioned taking some small rate cut for eight states. Just curious on what your thinking behind it? And how should we think about rates going forward?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. So we always -- like I said, we're kind of back to things that are a little bit normal. So if you think about on the auto side, combined ratio right around 88%. That doesn't mean that every states at 88%, that every DMA is at 88%, some are above, some are below. So you can imagine that if we're well-below our 88%, which is below our 1996 actual goal that we're going to take the opportunity to reduce those rates a little bit to bring in new business, along with our media spend and are unwinding of non-rate actions. Remember, too, when we think about that, and it's kind of what I said before, we want to make sure that we're taking those small nibbles, small bites. So even though we reduced rates, by a small amount, 8%. We increased rates in 13%, a small amount, which is just such different game than we've had to play in the last several years. And so that's where we'll think of rate cuts. We'll think of if, in fact, we're making wide margins and we believe it will benefit us for growth and benefit our consumers to have stable rates. We'll use that as one lever to continue new business growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. My second question is on the conversion rate. So in your presentation, you mentioned expanding significantly more than competitors. Conversion rate has come down due to the schedule shopping behavior. How is Progressive from thinking about dealing with the conversion rate?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. So we -- I think the question was about conversion rate. And obviously, we want to be on the short list for consumers and then ultimately convert that. So our prospects are high now because we're out there. And so you're going to see -- that's kind of the wide part of the tunnel, the funnel. And then if you go down, our conversion isn't as high because of the numbers. So we can't necessarily control that, but we think -- there's a lot of shopping out there. A lot of people just kind of making sure they shop because rates have been so volatile. But we will continue to work on making sure that our conversion rate is in line with what we think it should be on all products in all states.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Good morning. So most of my questions were answered, but I was wondering if you could talk about what you're see in terms of competitor behavior on pricing and marketing spend how it varies by channel -- because it seems like the mutuals as the group haven't been as proactive in raising prices, but just wondering if you could talk about the various channels and what you're seeing?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean, the channels are different because like we talked about today that was really focused on direct, which is more of a fixed spend. And then the spend on the agency side is more variable depending on new and renewal and then, of course, what's happening in the industry in terms of commission amounts. I think we have seen our competitors, I would say, acting rationally. And I think there's been a lot of rate in the system, still a lot of rate coming into the system. I can see it becoming more competitive. And if that's the case, I think you'll likely see more spending. And so that's -- to me, that's the rational case. So whether your goal is 96% or 95% or 105%, I think at some point, you need to be mean to be rational and price your right to risk. And I believe we're seeing that. And we all have our own models, obviously, I am biased and believe that our model is the best because it's that balance of growth and profitability and competitive prices and most importantly, our people and culture. So I think this should be an interesting couple of years, but I do see some rational movement from -- across a lot of our competitors.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then your margins have obviously been pretty good for the last several quarters, but most of your peers' margins are improving as well. So wondering if you see an environment where in a few quarters, you start to see regulatory pushback on prices since they have gone up a lot or just the excess profit you're earning get eroded because of an uptick in composition on prices?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean, I don't -- again, I don't want the pendulum to swing the other way because they're still about 10% states or premium that we don't actually have the right rates on the street from our perspective in terms of where we want to be. So we will, like I said, and as you read, we did reduce rates in 8 states, and we'll continue to watch that. We want to make a '96. I want to -- we want to grow. We want to grow unit growth. And that's why we're doing what we have said we've always done, and that is advertise more, make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us most, as you see some of the volatile weather happening. And I think regulators, we work with them and the relationships are really important to make sure that there's two things that we have adequate rates on the street, competitive prices. So, if we lower rates, I think people will follow as well because everyone has to have competitive prices. It's so easy to shop. And easy to leave your carrier if you want to. So, it's really important to have competitive prices, and so much goes into that, whether it's segmentation or our claims efficiency, et cetera. So, I think that's what we have to look at. I think in addition that we know that our customers do want stable rates. And we're going to continue to work on that and work with our industry. I just don't -- our industry commissioners. I just don't want to swing the other way because this has been stable for just a couple of quarters. And while I don't think we're going to have anything unforeseen happen, I've probably said that a few times in the last couple of years where things have been unforeseen have happened. So, we will continue to let this play out, do the right thing, and we'll always try to be competitive in order to grow our units, which is the most important measure of growth to us.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward of Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering, we noticed that your mobile app takeup seems to be pretty high for auto policies in general, at least relative to your competitors. So, just wondering if you have any insight as to why that might be -- it doesn't seem like it's just telematics, but are you incentivizing maybe the use of digital ID cards and paperless or is it something else?\nTricia Griffith: I think that\u2019s sort of with the question in terms of the evolution of technology. So, we have a lot of our new apps come in through mobile. And I think if you come in, your likelihood of you want to stay there. And so we continue to invest in making our mobile app more friendly, access to things like you said, the ID card and making payments and just making it easier. So, we've invested a lot in the last more than a decade on the mobile app, and we'll continue to do so. And when you think about one of our strategic pillars as broad coverage, that's one coverage where people go in on the app. And when I go in on an app, I want to stay there and be able to do everything. So, that is service, that's buy, that\u2019s -- get the information I need. So, I think you're right that it's continued, and I think it's based on our investments and people that want to do business in that way.\nMichael Ward: Okay. And then just expanding on the comments about direct home sales. Wondering if you can kind of elaborate on that in the context of the acceleration in Robinson growth indirect trying to square those two. I guess, are Robinson customer wins taking place more online or more over the phone? And how should we think about your Robinson share expansion going forward?\nTricia Griffith: Yes. Well, our Robinson growth is taking place across the board. I would say, higher in the agency because that's really where we needed to have a homeowners product to be able to access those auto customers in the independent agent channel. What I would say is, so we started what we call HomeQuote Explorer many, many years ago. And it was really based on having a stable group of carriers in addition to us, where if we didn't want to write a risk, we could give it to another carrier or another carrier. And so we're going to continue to evolve that. And we have that really across the board. That has been how we like -- how we like to look at what the customers need. And when we think of broad coverage, we have HomeQuote Explorer, which is the direct home, which we want more and more Robinsons there, but they don't necessarily have to be Robinsons. On the commercial side, we have BusinessQuote Explorer, again, where you can buy our commercial auto, but then maybe a general liability policy from another carrier. And then we have AutoQuote Explorer, where we're doing the same thing. It's really about making sure it's ease of use for our customers. And they've come to us through the acquisition -- the media spend that we look at. So they come to us. And if we can't seal the deal, why wouldn't we help them seal the deal with somebody else who wants that risk. So I think it will continue to grow. Again, first things first in our desire to derisk our product portfolio. But I'm proud that we have invested in HomeQuote Explorer and think that will be a long-term solution for us on the direct side.\nMichael Ward: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Good morning. Tricia, I was wondering if you could just talk about how much of a lag or if there is a lag between when you ramp ad spend. And when you start to see higher sales? I know that March was the highest ad spend month in your history that obviously increased from there. In the second quarter, -- so I'm just wondering -- and it also looks like that happened in June as well where there was another tick up. Is there any sort of lag between when you hit the ad spend and when you start to see the PIF come through?\nTricia Griffith: I would say there's a little bit of lag, but we measure that pretty closely when we have any media spend in terms of our -- the prospects coming in. And then, of course, then we'll measure the prospects that turn into sales. I mean there's a little lag. We also -- we were never totally closed in our advertising. So there's a kind of constantly making sure that we're top of mind for consumers to be on that short list to even shop. So I'd say there's some lag, but I don't think there's anything discernible.\nDavid Motemaden: Understood. Thanks. That's helpful. And then last quarter, I think it was in the 10-Q. It sounded like there were 10 points of rate that we're still to earn in throughout the course of 2024. I'm wondering where that stands now and how we should think of that as just additional rate earning in above trend that you can then spend on advertising.\nTricia Griffith: So you're talking specifically about auto or overall?\nDavid Motemaden: Yes, auto.\nTricia Griffith: Yes. On the auto, we've taken so much rates over the years. We have -- we took a little bit for the quarter two, 2% year-to-date. We have a little bit more to earned in, Earn in, maybe 2-ish for the rest of the year. We feel really good about our rates. And in fact, that's why we're able to take a little bit of movement in those eight states where we reduced rates a little bit. But as you think about -- if you go back, it was painful. 2022, we took 13.5%, 2023, we took nearly 19%. So -- the cumulative rates, and of course, they earn in more quickly than home have been a lot. And so we feel really good about having it be a little bit less during this year in terms of our competitiveness.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks. Good morning. So, obviously, all three months, April, May and June looked really good from the PIF standpoint. But I guess, seasonally, if we look historically, those actually have not been a big PIF margin. I'm just curious -- would you say that the result was in spite of seasonal headwinds that are still in place? Or is the whole seasonality component of trying to analyze things kind of a moot point just given the changing dynamics?\nTricia Griffith: Now I don't want to say it's a moot point. I think it was a blend of having the right rates on the street, being able to pull back on non-rate items that we put into place when we were trying to stop growth, and our increase in media spend as well as us being very adequately staffed to handle everything. So I think it was a lot of dynamics, sort of, the perfect storm in a good way to position us in that way. So I think it's just a bunch of things that came together with a lot hard work with a lot of teams to make sure that we had -- that we were able to capitalize and maximize our PIF growth.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I guess just on the advertising, I mean, you mentioned 2023, you pulled back a ton, you still spent over $1 billion, I would guess that ad spend is not just a function of not just designed to add new business and most probably also play some kind of retention role. I don't know if there's any way to quantify if there's a base amount you have to advertise, or this increasing advertising spend more. Does that help your attention as well? But I'm just curious how you guys think about that or if there is any way to quantify that impact?\nTricia Griffith: Yeah. I mean I think, obviously, the best thing for retention is to have stable rates. But you can't even -- if you don't have a brand out there, it's hard to be on the short list of people that think about companies go to buy and that have especially because our brand, I think, is well thought of. We have many different campaigns that hit different people differently. We try to break through with our humor. We try to make sure that customer\u2019s see adds the right amount of time, not too little, not too much to make sure we're on that. I think we have been in the last several years doing some tests from a retention, or just understanding addressable markets. We talked a little bit about the multilingual campaign. So we do spend some money on making sure that we have campaigns out there, whether digital or mass media, or people do see us in terms of what our purpose is, and that is to move forward and live fully. That's what we want our customers and our employees and communities to do so. It is really about attracting and then when they come here, we want to retain them with stable prices, great service and all the products they need.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nTricia Griffith: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski of BMO. Your line is now open.\nMichael Zaremski: Thanks. Good morning. First question, I guess, a follow-up to Rob Cox's, you asked about the sustainability of frequency trends that are favorable, and you kind of unpacked a couple of items on mix and non-rate actions. What about on the severity side? I know you ever looks very favorable, especially relative to some of the pure data. I know your -- you had easy comps, I guess, you can say also last year. But how are you thinking about any of the sustainability or mix factors on severity these days?\nTricia Griffith : I think the mix factor can take into place some of it, but some of the severity had gone up so much during the pandemic in subsequent years in terms of think used car prices. And those are still up, but they're stable relative to pre-pandemic. So that's where you're seeing some of the stability in terms of BI [ph] had an uptick in attorney rep in a larger loss in litigation. So I think the things are stabilizing. It's hard to say what will happen, but we've had several lines of data where we do see some stability in that, which gives us a little bit of confidence as we move forward. .\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. So nothing you're calling out kind of on your mix that should make it more running at a lower rate than it has in the past, okay?\nTricia Griffith : Yes. No, mostly just getting hopefully to a more stable place.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. And just lastly, my -- my follow-up is on the Jay's part of the presentation on direct-to-consumer. And just by the way, I remember being at your live Investor Day in Ohio, probably a decade plus ago when you asked the audience how many times you think we look at our smartphones. And I was -- I always think about that as I look at my phone, and we all look at our phone way too much these days. So you guys were ahead of the trend. But -- but just I guess, Jay mentioned there was a -- it seems like you mentioned a catalyst for more spend that you improved your data back in the 2016 to 2017 time frame, I believe. I don't know if is that something worth elaborating on and if you feel that there's been a -- you're even improving more so today than in the past? Or was that kind of a big -- you mentioned that. So I was curious if that kind of a -- if there's something special happen then? Thanks.\nTricia Griffith : No. I mean I think a lot of things have happened since and that was sort of a pivotal time where we decided that we were going to go ahead as we looked backwards spend more closely to our targeted acquisition cost to understand what that would mean to growth. I will say since then, having worked closely with this group, \"Oh my gosh, the amount of data and how surgical they understand our customers and understand who sees what, when, what that means, how we should price for Sam and Omaha versus a Diane in Missouri is incredible. So it hasn't stopped, and it actually builds off of each other. So it's sort of like our product model. It's not like, \"Oh, Jay's group learns this and then it's -- the next thing they learn. It's like multiplicative. And so I would say, if you have asked me in 2017, I would have said this group is incredible. The group now, which is the same and more people are even better. So what we are learning and what we are understanding from just a granular level is truly amazing. I think that's one of many of our secret sauces. So as we wrap this up, do want to thank Dave and Jay and their incredible teams for the nimbleness when we've hit up against our target. They've never complained about pulling back. And my hope is this year that -- never say no to their additional spend to grow, and they can spend as much as they can to make sure we grow the entire firm. So thank you, great questions today. I appreciate everyone coming to our to our event.\nDoug Constantine: That appears to been our final question. So that concludes our event. Martin, I'll hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.\nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation Fourth [ph] Quarter Investor Event. Information about a replay of the event will be available in the Investor Relations section of Progressive website for next year. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tricia Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And yes, you're exactly right, with 2 million additional auto policies and 2.6 million additional policies overall for the company, there's so many inputs that go into a combined ratio that it's hard to discern exactly how the future will go. But here's what I would say. We're very efficient, and there's been a lot of ambient shopping, as you've seen in our presentations and I've written about we've talked about. And so we're able to have our cost per sell well below our targeted acquisition cost. Now the fact is we want even more growth. So we want to grow from a premium perspective, but I've talked a lot about my preferred -- our preferred method of growth is a unit of growth. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're sitting in really great position. So we will spend more if we think we can continue to grow policies units because, frankly, our premium kind of goes up and down, as you've seen in the last four years based on our trends. It's been a high inflationary trend that's abating, which is great for our customers. So while I'm not going to be able signal what our combined ratio will be, know that we're going to spend as much as we can from a media perspective if we think we can get it in an efficient cost with, again, calendar year and lifetime 1916, we're going to continue to drive down non-acquisition expense ratios, we're going to continue to work on our accuracy and efficiency as well as customer service and work environment, our claims organization, which we have seen just a lot of really great momentum as we've gotten staffed and more tenure in there, and we're going to continue to evolve our brand. So if you look at that, I can't tell you in your model what to put in for our combined ratio, but know that we're looking at all levers at all times, but we feel like we are finally in a really good position to be able to do what we've always said we wanted to do and take small bites of the apple and continue to grow. And whether that's small bite a little bit upward a little bit downward, really be in a position to grow and take even more market share than we've taken in the first half of this year. Yeah. We really try to separate the operational with our capital management. So, obviously, our net investment income has improved because we've had some bonds maturing, we have a lot of money from the operations, so we can put that into bonds with higher yields. But really our job, at the Progressive Capital Management, we actually just got back from a business review last week is to protect balance sheet. We're going to continue to grow as fast as we can. We're not going to change the dynamics of our overall original [ph] objectives that we've had since 1971 probably before that, but that is to grow as fast as we can at a 1996 combined ratio, or making at least $0.04 of underwriting profit, but making sure that we take care of our customers. So we look at the competition and competitors have just different models. We're going to continue to have the motto we have had for a long time because we think it's a winning one. Thanks Bob. We sure hope so, Elyse. We're going to continue that. I would say if you -- if there's ever a signal of our confidence in our rates, it's based on what we're spending on our media. So you'll see that we're pretty confident what a difference a year makes. But our intentions are to continue on this path and really leverage where we're at from a competitive perspective, both a media and brand perspective, competitive prices, and we're going to hopefully continue that throughout 2024 and beyond. Yes, I think we're still seeing a lot of ambient shopping and there are some people, there's some -- some of our competitors that are still getting a fair amount of rate, which will continue to have shopping as we talked about, both with our of prospects and conversion. So, we feel really great about where at different companies, of course, measure it differently. And I think really the secret sauce is what Dave and Jay talked about. And that is something that we've worked on not for a year, not for two years, for decades and is built upon each other, and then, of course, working with our product group, our claims group, our marketing group that's really the special secret sauce. So, now, we feel really great about the efficiency. And we feel, like I said, even more importantly, great about having the right rates on the street. Now, again, that -- I can change a little bit here and there, but it's been such a pendulum swing in the last four years, giving $1 billion back to customers and lowering rates during the pandemic and then, of course, the inflation. It's really nice to what we see at this point in time just some stability, which our customers deserve and just tweaking it up and down a little bit, and that's really where the fun begins where we really can get competitive on our advertising, our media and, of course, taking care of our customers. Thanks Elyse. Yes, I mean I think that the generation, I think I've shared with you before, I have six children that everyone wants to buy online, that makes more sense. It's easy. I remember when we first started prog.com, it was called something else is called Auto Pro. No one thought anyone would ever buy auto insurance online, and we made a bet. And it's difficult. And it was an uphill battle. It was an expensive battle, it took us 10 years before we made money. As if you go back into this presentation, you look at what Dave Krew said, we were in SureTec before that it was never coined a name. So, I think we feel pretty proud that we're going to continue to innovate. That's so important in our DNA. So, we're going to continue with the integrated marketing campaigns. I think for us, it's really about choice for consumers. So, I am still an agency customer. It works for me, it doesn't work for my children. So, I think to answer your question, it's hard to get into, but even as we watch the competition, it really boils down to competitors and all of us making sure that we have the right choices for our consumers. And that's really where we want to be. And we believe that we can compete really effectively in both the direct and agency channel, and we have been. Yeah. I mean I think renters is oftentimes required, we have an easy, really quote flow for renters. We do like to have the auto renters bundled. We also know that renters can often turn into homeowners. And of course, we have to make sure that those homes are ones that fit our risk profile as we move forward and de-risk that book a little bit. But yeah, any time we see that bundle happen, whether it's auto and renters and then any other product you add that also causes stickiness, and that's really where the rubber meets the road is making sure that consumers we have what they need and when we do, they stay for a long time. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. A great question, Greg. Let me take that one. It rarely happens, but we watch it closely, mainly because we talk about growing as fast as we can at or below a '96 if we can take care of our customers. I recall one time I'll get the year wrong but it was early 2000s. We were growing a lot. And I remember specifically, we had to tell the state of Texas that we had to slow down. So we had to slow down growth there. So, that obviously is embedded in me. I wasn't even in the role. But having been in the claims role, you work closely, and I know our claims President works closely with Pat and his group to say, okay, here's where we're adequately staffed. And also the great part about now having the ability to have some hybrid work is you can shift work to different states. So you can -- if we are a little bit behind in staffing in one state, we could -- and a little bit above in the other, we can train those people to work that state if we need to. All we're saying and all Jay saying is that if we need to shut off media at a local basis like we did in the last couple of years when we didn't have the right rates on the street, we can do that or if aren't staffed appropriately. Now, right after the pandemic going into 2022, I would say, we had way more turnover than we would normally like in both claims in CRM, we're in a completely different spot right now. In fact, are hiring ahead of need and feel really good and I talked a little bit about making sure that we -- with new reps that we are really accurate and we pay the fair amount and that we're efficient. So that's really where we're going to be able to turn that on now because we feel really great about our staffing tenure, the quality and our accuracy. That is a great question, and we've been working on that for some time. We had a little setback with some litigations in law, law in Colorado. I won't go into the details because it's out there. But it really caused us to pause because it's really difficult for us when we want to do national advertising to control who's seeing in any given state. So we paused on that. Now we have done a couple ads, one in particular, really sweet one. If you go through it, it's a deer talking to the dove and a dad talking to the new driver. And there's some nods obviously, to Latin X [ph], which we think is important. And I totally agree with you. So we have a strategy and a whole team working on our multilingual, a sort of ability to grow. We can grow both in the agency channel, and we have a huge group of what we call Sagora reps [ph] here that handle our Spanish-speaking customers. We believe that this is a big opportunity. Again, we had to pause a little bit because of something that happened in Colorado, but we talk about this a lot. In fact, we're getting an update in one of my upcoming direct report meetings on where we're going with our multilingual strategy. Thank you, Gregory. Yes. That's several questions. I'll go back to begin with. I think we'll always continue to try to grow in all channels. So we'll use that innovation. I think Jay's big bet on advertising. We had -- we sort of took a decomp and looked at where we were at a long time like go back to like the mid-2000s. And we advertised, we did it well. We had a brand but not solidified. And I think we were able to make a big bet when we had a brand that people recognize that respected, they talked about choice that talked about savings and I actually remember it pretty well because it was not long after I came into this job, I came in mid-2016, we bumped up against the 96 in my first quarter, and shortly thereafter, and I meet with the acquisition teams all the time. Jay and his team came with an approach, and it was brilliant, and I supported it. In fact, Jay often comes to me or through Pat and to me to say we need spend more here, and here's why. And honestly, their group is so spot on. I've never said no. And of course, they've given us a gift of pulling back when we've needed to. So on the direct homeowner side, we're about -- I think about 25% of our business comes into the direct side. So, but think that's Progressive Home and another stable group of carriers. We're going to continue to expand that because we do think people want to buy online. I don't know what the pivot point will be where it's 50-50, like it is in auto, but we're going to continue to invest in that that because we think it's important. And because a home is so much more volatile. And if you get to a density situation can be problematic during storms, we'll continue to work with really solid partners to make sure it benefits them and us as a win for all companies. Well, some of that -- some of those rates you're looking at, like we talked about our growth in renters, which is really much smaller average written premium. We took about 4% in the quarter. And year-to-date, it will be about 10% on a trailing 12% about, 17%. So we've taken quite a lot of a lot of rate, and we've had other non-rate actions that we've taken to derisk our books. I think first things first, we're going to focus on de-risking the book, doing what we've said. We have the 115,000 non-renewals in Florida that we knew were unprofitable. We worked with Florida to have options for those consumers. We're going to continue for us to work on improved segmentation. We have eight states on our new 5.0 product. Get as good at our pricing and our segmentation and really at that surgical level as we have in auto, and that takes some time. We've been working diligently on it. I said in my letter, we're going to be even more aggressive. I think at that point, when the dust clears, we'll be able to take more market share. In the meantime, we are continuing to grow in what we perceive as more nonvolatile states. Weather is always the factor that we have to take into account all the time. But right now, our focus is derisking a property. And then as we feel like we're in a good position, and we do have the right rates. We'll grow in the areas where we think it's most important to grow for the whole health of portfolio. Thank you. Yeah. To answer the last part, I have no idea. The first part, we might feel some pressure on cost per sale, but it is so much below TAC that we feel really good about the efficiency. Yeah. So if you look at our frequency being down about 8%, the majority of that is really \u2013 it's always hard to discern exactly. I would say, the two factors right now for us is our preferred mix and some of the non-rate actions. So we've unwound or continue to unwind the non-reactions. The preferred business, our motto has always been that we want Sam, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. We want every customer as long as we can make a lifetime in a calendar year, 1996 combined ratio. So we made to pressure on that. But again, it's really hard to discern and really put together exactly what makes frequency. We watch it closely. As well as we do, obviously, frequency and then react to that accordingly. But like I've said, I feel like we're in such a better position in terms of stability around those trends. And if we can now start to do what we do best, and that is thoroughly look at every product, every state, new and renewal and take a little bit up, a little bit down, a little bit up, a little bit down, make those rates stable for our consumers. That's really the winning proposition for us. Thanks. Yeah. So we always -- like I said, we're kind of back to things that are a little bit normal. So if you think about on the auto side, combined ratio right around 88%. That doesn't mean that every states at 88%, that every DMA is at 88%, some are above, some are below. So you can imagine that if we're well-below our 88%, which is below our 1996 actual goal that we're going to take the opportunity to reduce those rates a little bit to bring in new business, along with our media spend and are unwinding of non-rate actions. Remember, too, when we think about that, and it's kind of what I said before, we want to make sure that we're taking those small nibbles, small bites. So even though we reduced rates, by a small amount, 8%. We increased rates in 13%, a small amount, which is just such different game than we've had to play in the last several years. And so that's where we'll think of rate cuts. We'll think of if, in fact, we're making wide margins and we believe it will benefit us for growth and benefit our consumers to have stable rates. We'll use that as one lever to continue new business growth. Yeah. So we -- I think the question was about conversion rate. And obviously, we want to be on the short list for consumers and then ultimately convert that. So our prospects are high now because we're out there. And so you're going to see -- that's kind of the wide part of the tunnel, the funnel. And then if you go down, our conversion isn't as high because of the numbers. So we can't necessarily control that, but we think -- there's a lot of shopping out there. A lot of people just kind of making sure they shop because rates have been so volatile. But we will continue to work on making sure that our conversion rate is in line with what we think it should be on all products in all states. Yeah. I mean, the channels are different because like we talked about today that was really focused on direct, which is more of a fixed spend. And then the spend on the agency side is more variable depending on new and renewal and then, of course, what's happening in the industry in terms of commission amounts. I think we have seen our competitors, I would say, acting rationally. And I think there's been a lot of rate in the system, still a lot of rate coming into the system. I can see it becoming more competitive. And if that's the case, I think you'll likely see more spending. And so that's -- to me, that's the rational case. So whether your goal is 96% or 95% or 105%, I think at some point, you need to be mean to be rational and price your right to risk. And I believe we're seeing that. And we all have our own models, obviously, I am biased and believe that our model is the best because it's that balance of growth and profitability and competitive prices and most importantly, our people and culture. So I think this should be an interesting couple of years, but I do see some rational movement from -- across a lot of our competitors. Yeah. I mean, I don't -- again, I don't want the pendulum to swing the other way because they're still about 10% states or premium that we don't actually have the right rates on the street from our perspective in terms of where we want to be. So we will, like I said, and as you read, we did reduce rates in 8 states, and we'll continue to watch that. We want to make a '96. I want to -- we want to grow. We want to grow unit growth. And that's why we're doing what we have said we've always done, and that is advertise more, make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us most, as you see some of the volatile weather happening. And I think regulators, we work with them and the relationships are really important to make sure that there's two things that we have adequate rates on the street, competitive prices. So, if we lower rates, I think people will follow as well because everyone has to have competitive prices. It's so easy to shop. And easy to leave your carrier if you want to. So, it's really important to have competitive prices, and so much goes into that, whether it's segmentation or our claims efficiency, et cetera. So, I think that's what we have to look at. I think in addition that we know that our customers do want stable rates. And we're going to continue to work on that and work with our industry. I just don't -- our industry commissioners. I just don't want to swing the other way because this has been stable for just a couple of quarters. And while I don't think we're going to have anything unforeseen happen, I've probably said that a few times in the last couple of years where things have been unforeseen have happened. So, we will continue to let this play out, do the right thing, and we'll always try to be competitive in order to grow our units, which is the most important measure of growth to us. I think that's sort of with the question in terms of the evolution of technology. So, we have a lot of our new apps come in through mobile. And I think if you come in, your likelihood of you want to stay there. And so we continue to invest in making our mobile app more friendly, access to things like you said, the ID card and making payments and just making it easier. So, we've invested a lot in the last more than a decade on the mobile app, and we'll continue to do so. And when you think about one of our strategic pillars as broad coverage, that's one coverage where people go in on the app. And when I go in on an app, I want to stay there and be able to do everything. So, that is service, that's buy, that's -- get the information I need. So, I think you're right that it's continued, and I think it's based on our investments and people that want to do business in that way. Yes. Well, our Robinson growth is taking place across the board. I would say, higher in the agency because that's really where we needed to have a homeowners product to be able to access those auto customers in the independent agent channel. What I would say is, so we started what we call HomeQuote Explorer many, many years ago. And it was really based on having a stable group of carriers in addition to us, where if we didn't want to write a risk, we could give it to another carrier or another carrier. And so we're going to continue to evolve that. And we have that really across the board. That has been how we like -- how we like to look at what the customers need. And when we think of broad coverage, we have HomeQuote Explorer, which is the direct home, which we want more and more Robinsons there, but they don't necessarily have to be Robinsons. On the commercial side, we have BusinessQuote Explorer, again, where you can buy our commercial auto, but then maybe a general liability policy from another carrier. And then we have AutoQuote Explorer, where we're doing the same thing. It's really about making sure it's ease of use for our customers. And they've come to us through the acquisition -- the media spend that we look at. So they come to us. And if we can't seal the deal, why wouldn't we help them seal the deal with somebody else who wants that risk. So I think it will continue to grow. Again, first things first in our desire to derisk our product portfolio. But I'm proud that we have invested in HomeQuote Explorer and think that will be a long-term solution for us on the direct side. I would say there's a little bit of lag, but we measure that pretty closely when we have any media spend in terms of our -- the prospects coming in. And then, of course, then we'll measure the prospects that turn into sales. I mean there's a little lag. We also -- we were never totally closed in our advertising. So there's a kind of constantly making sure that we're top of mind for consumers to be on that short list to even shop. So I'd say there's some lag, but I don't think there's anything discernible. So you're talking specifically about auto or overall? Yes. On the auto, we've taken so much rates over the years. We have -- we took a little bit for the quarter two, 2% year-to-date. We have a little bit more to earned in, Earn in, maybe 2-ish for the rest of the year. We feel really good about our rates. And in fact, that's why we're able to take a little bit of movement in those eight states where we reduced rates a little bit. But as you think about -- if you go back, it was painful. 2022, we took 13.5%, 2023, we took nearly 19%. So -- the cumulative rates, and of course, they earn in more quickly than home have been a lot. And so we feel really good about having it be a little bit less during this year in terms of our competitiveness. Thank you. Now I don't want to say it's a moot point. I think it was a blend of having the right rates on the street, being able to pull back on non-rate items that we put into place when we were trying to stop growth, and our increase in media spend as well as us being very adequately staffed to handle everything. So I think it was a lot of dynamics, sort of, the perfect storm in a good way to position us in that way. So I think it's just a bunch of things that came together with a lot hard work with a lot of teams to make sure that we had -- that we were able to capitalize and maximize our PIF growth. Yeah. I mean I think, obviously, the best thing for retention is to have stable rates. But you can't even -- if you don't have a brand out there, it's hard to be on the short list of people that think about companies go to buy and that have especially because our brand, I think, is well thought of. We have many different campaigns that hit different people differently. We try to break through with our humor. We try to make sure that customer's see adds the right amount of time, not too little, not too much to make sure we're on that. I think we have been in the last several years doing some tests from a retention, or just understanding addressable markets. We talked a little bit about the multilingual campaign. So we do spend some money on making sure that we have campaigns out there, whether digital or mass media, or people do see us in terms of what our purpose is, and that is to move forward and live fully. That's what we want our customers and our employees and communities to do so. It is really about attracting and then when they come here, we want to retain them with stable prices, great service and all the products they need. Thanks, Ryan. I think the mix factor can take into place some of it, but some of the severity had gone up so much during the pandemic in subsequent years in terms of think used car prices. And those are still up, but they're stable relative to pre-pandemic. So that's where you're seeing some of the stability in terms of BI [ph] had an uptick in attorney rep in a larger loss in litigation. So I think the things are stabilizing. It's hard to say what will happen, but we've had several lines of data where we do see some stability in that, which gives us a little bit of confidence as we move forward. . Yes. No, mostly just getting hopefully to a more stable place. No. I mean I think a lot of things have happened since and that was sort of a pivotal time where we decided that we were going to go ahead as we looked backwards spend more closely to our targeted acquisition cost to understand what that would mean to growth. I will say since then, having worked closely with this group, \"Oh my gosh, the amount of data and how surgical they understand our customers and understand who sees what, when, what that means, how we should price for Sam and Omaha versus a Diane in Missouri is incredible. So it hasn't stopped, and it actually builds off of each other. So it's sort of like our product model. It's not like, \"Oh, Jay's group learns this and then it's -- the next thing they learn. It's like multiplicative. And so I would say, if you have asked me in 2017, I would have said this group is incredible. The group now, which is the same and more people are even better. So what we are learning and what we are understanding from just a granular level is truly amazing. I think that's one of many of our secret sauces. So as we wrap this up, do want to thank Dave and Jay and their incredible teams for the nimbleness when we've hit up against our target. They've never complained about pulling back. And my hope is this year that -- never say no to their additional spend to grow, and they can spend as much as they can to make sure we grow the entire firm. So thank you, great questions today. I appreciate everyone coming to our to our event."

            "content": "Thanks, Jay. Once Jay and his team get prospects to engage with Progressive, the direct acquisition experience team works to turn digital touches into productive experiences for the consumer and then profit for Progressive. My team is focused on progressive.com and our personal lines auto and recreation aligns direct sales funnels. There are parallel roles that focus on property and commercial lines applying similar concepts. Our goal is to deliver incremental lifetime underwriting profit each year by optimizing our digital experiences and periodically delivering breakthrough step functions in the evolving digital education, quote and purchase process. The term lifetime underwriting profit or LUP for short refers to the sum of expected profit dollars generated from the incremental sales we produce. I'll touch more on why that's important later. To do what we do requires very close collaboration with adjacent organizations; IT, product, CRM and marketing in particular. It also requires a diverse set of subject matter experts on our central team. We work to connect the dots between deep insurance knowledge, the digital agency mindset, data analytics, data science and process management. Another way to say this is a real balance of right and left brain disciplines come together. And in my opinion, that's where the value has had. Like the media team, we've been at this for several decades. Let's start with the origin story. There have been a number of digital first in our history. We are online in 1995 and started quoting and selling online soon thereafter. We started planning for scale, had segmented operational data and tracked results all before the turn of the century and 15-plus years prior to the coining of the term insurtech. Taking the time line a bit further and deeper, as I said, we were online in 1995. We first showed comparison rates online in 1996, sold our first fully digital auto policy in 1997 and expanded our online footprint from auto to recreational lines in 1999. As we grew, we set out to innovate in the user experience space with several end market innovations, such as Name Your Price. We also invested in our mobile quoting capabilities. Starting in 2017, we began to leverage advanced technologies to personalized user experience and increased funnel throughput. We also continued investing in other value-adding educational content and a chatbot. Which leads us to today selling millions of policies untouched by human hands each year plus a substantial number of digital-assisted sales that quote online and purchase over the phone. While over half of those digital sales happen on mobile devices. Here's a look at today's digital funnel. There are over 100 million visits to progressive.com annually. These leads to tens of millions of quote starts and ultimately, millions of digital sales. The screen shots on the right of the slide are representative way points as a prospect navigates from our homepage into an auto quote in this case, and ultimately a purchase. A 1% movement in throughput generally contributes sales lift that equates to tens of millions profit dollars. To that end, we invest significant talent and resources in the user experience, technology and optimization. These incremental sales are high margin given the media team already got the prospects in door. To be clear, we often count sales for ease of communication, but the underlying analysis of Lyft generally contemplates contribution of lifetime underwriting profit or LUP as noted earlier, given all the policies are not the same and trade-offs can present themselves. Optimizing motorcycle versus auto lift in a multiproduct experience is one example of such a LUP based tradeoff. I'll now transition from our digital history and scale to some of the how of what we do. Our digital experience is in effect, the front end of our highly segmented product. Our product continues to evolve and move faster, which is a very good thing but using the metaphor on the slide requires our digital customer acquisition train to stay sync with an accelerating product train. Our product requires a complex interview for infrequent transaction with many options. We have decades of experience delivering an accurate online quote and optimizing the user experience simultaneously. Along the way, we've evolved a set of tactics and principles that help us make informed trade-offs. We often run pilots ahead of product changes to assess the best way to gather a given rating input. And by best, we mean most accurate and easiest for the consumer. We've also evolved a living analytic framework to assess and target abandoned points as our user experience and product evolve together. As stated a bit earlier, there is much value to be had at the interface of deep insurance knowledge and deep user experience knowledge. To be clear, the fastest quote is not our goal. Optimal use of the consumer's time is. An instant or quick quote generally implies assumptions in downstream rework. Not to say we don't experiment, in fact, we have a motorcycle quick quote pilot in market in several states as we speak, as well as embedded rates with automotive and financial partners. But the science needs to include rate accuracy in a total end-to-end look at the customer experience from quote to purchase to onboarding. Regarding that science, our scale affords lots of data to optimize new experiences via A/B testing. As part of that testing, we look for sales and LUP [ph] lift, as one might expect, and also come full circle to look at the impact of user experience on product mix. How you ask and display the question can matter. To conclude this slide, keeping up with a fast-moving product, while simultaneously improving user experience and sales throughput necessitates that we have deep connections and frequent collaboration with our product and IT partners. Another way to state our objective function is to stay on and ultimately stretch the efficient frontier of customer ease and segmentation fidelity. As the final topic in our acquisition experience section, I'll touch on our approach to personalization and the digital funnel. We know that delivering the right content to the right consumer in the right context drive substantial value. As I pointed out before, we have been delivering personalized content to enhance customer experience and drive increased sales associated LUP since 2017 We've built a number of points of user experience personalization throughout our digital funnel. Personalization use cases have led to cumulative benefits in the hundreds of millions of dollars proven via A/B tests in the marketplace. Before breaking down our approach to real-time digital personalization on the next slide, I'll also mention another point of advanced technology deployment. Since 2018, our quoting and progressive.com chatbots have delivered millions of conversations and replaced millions of dollars of human support cost. While I won't get into detail on the specifics since this is a fast-moving space that provides real competitive advantage, I'll break down our approach. Delivering personalization at scale in a digital sales funnel in real time requires a set of balanced capabilities. We continue to evolve our capability set along four dimensions. Every year, we work to make sure we advance along each of four key elements, represented on what we call the personalization wheel. While not in a particular order, I'll start with context data. We continue to evolve the data we can access in a real-time digital funnel to drive decisions. We take great care around annuity and privacy as we use the data to drive better user experience. Working clockwise on the wheel, we come to content. Delivering the right content to the right consumer in right context is at the heart of our digital personalization work. We constantly work to add new use cases to our road maps, think stars on the prior slide. A close connection with the marketing team is important here. Next is Decision Science. We continue to add new models and evolve existing ones. Context data is the input, a content decision is the output. Last and absolutely not least, is the delivery system. We need an infrastructure that delivers the content decision and the content itself in milliseconds where the value of optimized content is lost. We also need a nimble environment for our data scientists and engineers to test and evolve new models. We have a strong partnership with our IT team to ensure we leverage and influence the latest enterprise-wide developments, while meeting more current in-market objectives. We work advance on all four of these dimensions each year as a means to drive a road map of short, medium and longer-term end-market tests and ultimately, sales and LUP lift. That was a very brief overview of our direct acquisition experience world. To summarize, we've been at digital sales funnel growth and optimization for a very long time. We have a lot of data that we learn from and advance in progressive fashion. A tight coupling with product is not only necessary, but we believe a source of significant advantage that Insurtech startups will likely never have. We continue to advance our personalization capability set in this space. And last but not least, we've been evolving at the junction of insurance and technology for decades to help fuel the direct customer acquisition virtuous cycle."

            "name": "Pat Callahan",
            "content": "Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Pat Callahan, Personal Lines, President, and I'm pleased to introduce the topic of today's presentation, direct acquisition. Our vision is to become consumers, agents and business owners, number one destination for insurance and other financial needs. To achieve that vision, we strive to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for their insurance and to optimize our experiences to meet the needs of individual consumers. A foundational element of this optimization is to understand the differences between our agency and direct channel customers. Agency customers often choose that channel, because they value the professional local counsel, ease of shopping, breadth and depth of product and carrier options available through independent agents. These customers often have more complex insurance needs. And as such, the expertise provided by an agent coupled with the personal relationship agents build with their customers gives the customer peace of mind. The direct channel customer frequently places higher value on the convenience and ease of access afforded through self-service 24/7 shopping and servicing. They often have less complex needs and feel comfortable making insurance decisions after educating themselves through the tools that we provide online, supplemented by the knowledge of our trained and licensed direct consultants. The customers, segmentation and economics of these two auto insurance distribution channels are fundamentally different, which is why we've developed, deployed and optimized distinct personal auto products for each channel. The result of these distinct products is not necessarily higher or lower rates in one channel versus the other, as we target similar combined ratios. But instead, delivers products that better aligns our rates with the different indemnity and expense characteristics of each channel. There are three primary distribution channels for U.S. auto insurance; captive agents, independent agents, and direct-to-consumer. We write through both independent agents where we're the market share leader and through direct where we're the number two writer, enjoying over 25% and growing market share. The independent agency and direct channels make up the majority of the U.S. personal auto insurance market and continue to grow faster than the captive market. The current hard market has distorted some long-term channel trends as certain large competitors in these channels either shrink significantly or grow rapidly amid large underwriting losses. These dynamics have presented an opportunity for us as prospects have been released to the market and rate increases from less well segmented carriers have driven competitors to be adversely selected. On the right side of the screen, you'll note just how critical our dual-channel strategy has been to achieving our continued market share growth. But today, we're going to spend time focusing on what drives our success in the direct channel. Insurance is a trust-based business and we build that trust and take share from competitors within the direct channel through the strength of our brand, the power of our segmentation, the breadth of our media presence, and the experiences we deliver to our customers. Our presentation will focus on two aspects of the direct channel; media and customer experience. We think about direct customer acquisition has a funnel with a virtuous cycle, similar to what we've previously shared from a product segmentation perspective. Media sits at the top of this funnel, where our online presence and award-winning advertising is deployed and optimized by our world-class in-house media team. Our advertising delivers billions of impressions every year, which in turn bring more than 100 million visitors to progressive.com annually. The experience on progressive.com turns those initial touches into tens of millions of quotes and ultimately, millions of sales annually. As we put more prospects through our funnel, we obtained the data to optimize the experience which in turn improves the media economics at the top of the funnel, which again, leads to further optimization. Our scale means this cycle is difficult for competitors to replicate, which has helped to continue to feed our market share growth. Today, our direct media business leader, Jay VanAntwerp, a 20-year progressive employee will provide insights on how we optimize our media spend and why investors should feel confident that when we invest a dollar in media, it's a dollar well spent. After Jay, Dave Krew, our acquisition experience business leader will join us. Dave has led our acquisition experience team for 12 of his 34-year progressive tenure. He will walk us through how progressive.com has evolved from a basic Web 1.0 site back in the 1990s to become the number one ranked insurance website today. And, how his team enables us to continue to increase the complexity of our rating and our products, while simultaneously improving yield through our acquisition funnel. Thanks again for joining us today, and I will now hand it over to Jay. Jay?"

            "name": "Jay VanAntwerp",
            "content": "Thanks Pat. Today, I want to begin by talking about our Media Group and why we believe it is a competitive advantage for Progressive that would be incredibly challenging for our competitors to replicate in the near to medium terms. One of the distinct things about Progressive is that we buy almost all of our media using an in-house team. The media channels we buy include mass media like TV and radio, programmatic display, paid social media, direct mail and paid search. Virtually any type of advertising or demand generation that is purchased, our media team buys. We believe that this makes us unique, not just in the insurance industry, but advertising industry overall. This is not a new development. The decision to buy media in-house was made almost at the very beginning of our efforts in the direct channel in the mid-1990s. At that time, our demand generation efforts were focused on television and direct mail. But since then, our Media Group has evolved with the media landscape. As digital channels like programmatic display and paid social media have become more prominent, our media team has given appropriate focus to those areas. And using Progressive's risk learn, grow philosophy, we develop viewpoints on how to buy those media types efficiently. So our current capabilities are the result of an evolution of over three decades. Given how long we have been doing this and how ingrained the Media Group is within the company, it would be very challenging to assemble a team from scratch that would be able to efficiently deploy spend in all media channels and at our current scale. What are some of the advantages that having an in-house team gives us? Our focus relative to an external agency is very important. We focus on one brand and one small set of products. This allows for a level specialization that an external agency would be challenged to match. We are able to leverage one of Progressive's core strengths, which is analytics. Progressive has a very strong history and track record of analytical innovation. We draw on those capabilities and building our analytical team. Another advantage our in-house team has over an external agency is product knowledge. Our analysts typically come from other areas of the company. They understand our product. They understand the dynamics of the auto insurance market. They're able to bring the insurance context to how they look at media in a way that no external agency would be able to replicate. If you combine the focus with the analytics, the result is custom models built specifically for Progressive using first-party data we would never make available to an external third-party. All of our models are proprietary, using our data to evaluate only our brand and the products that we sell as opposed to a one-size-fits-all model for multiple clients that you might get using an external agency. This has been incredibly impactful. We have leveraged our analytical horsepower and first-party data to dig into all of our spend and determine the relative efficiency and lifetime value of all the different media channels. This then gives us a guide for the optimal places to spend more when adding budget and when reducing the budget, so we can optimize for Progressive specific needs. Progressive is a leader in segmentation for auto insurance pricing, it is similarly powerful when we bring these skills to how we buy media. Another advantage is the ability to quickly flex the budget. Our budget is flexible within controls, which I will talk about later in the presentation. We are willing to increase the budget if there is efficient opportunity and available margin within our calendar year 1996 combined ratio target to fund the additional spend. Also, if there is a need to reduce the expense ratio in order to hit our target 1996, we can do that quickly as well. Our analytics show us how to optimize sales, both when adding and when cutting. Furthermore, we are able to flex our budget up and down extremely quickly. Another advantage is that we have aligned incentives. Like other progressive employees, our media teams on our gainshare annual bonus program. So they benefit from the success of Progressive in a way that a media agency that is compensated on commission wouldn't. A media agency is primarily incented to encourage clients to spend more on media in order to increase commissions. Our media team is focused on the core strategies of Progressive, primarily profitable growth. We also have lower overhead costs than an equivalent program that relies on external media agencies. So not only are we buying the media smarter, but we are also doing it at a lower cost. A 5% commission on $2 billion in spend which is about what we spent at our peak in 2020 would be $100 million. Our team is less than 100 people with total annual cost for this team this team considerably lower than $100 million. Finally, and really cannot be overstated. Our team has very strong relationships with in Progressive that no external agency would be able to develop. While we work closely with our marketing team in the way most agencies would. We also work directly with state product managers and general managers as well as many other areas of the business. We also have a very firm understanding of the business that allows us to credibly show how what we do in the Media Group benefits Progressive. As I talk more about some of the accomplishments of the last decade, I think it would be unlikely that an outside agency would have been able to make the case to be as aggressive as we were leading up to our peak spend in 2020 and could an outside agency move as quickly to make cuts as we did in 2023. To summarize, we feel that our Media Group and the capabilities that we have built over 30 years have contributed greatly to Progressive success. I will talk specifically about the last decade and how we have been able to support Progressive's goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a '96. Before talking about progressive specific spend over the last decade, it is worth providing context about insurance industry ad spend over the last 30 years because it has shifted significantly over time. Progressive Direct and other directors became more aggressive in the mid-1990s, with the emergence of the direct-to-consumer business model for auto insurance. Which spurred strong growth in insurance and advertising spend. From 1996 to 2003, and there was 10% compound annual growth in Media spend. This is a high rate of growth, and yet that rate of growth increased about 50% from 2003 to 2011, with the compound annual growth rate rising to 15%. Between 2011 and 2017, industry ad spend slowed to only 2%, largely driven by agency distributed companies whose economic models didn't allow them to keep pace with the direct-to-consumer companies who continue to have double-digit growth rates during this time period. Starting in 2017, growth in advertising ramped up again from 2017 to 2021, the industry compound annual growth increased five times from the previous period to 10%. We will talk about some of the dynamics happening at that time that may have spurred the next round of growth. But there is a strong argument to be made that Progressive was the catalyst as we started spending more at this time and competitors followed suit. As we know, overall industry profitability issues in 2022 and 2023 led to a contraction in ad spend as the compound annual growth rate for those two years was negative 20%. That was the overall industry landscape. Now, let's talk about Progressive specifically. Prior to 2017, Progressive's media spend was under $700 million and we are consistently around 10% of total industry spend. In 2015 and 2016, we really hit our stride in using analytics to generate insights for how to buy media more efficiently. We were able to come up with a common metric between all media types that allowed us to better evaluate where our spend was efficient and where it wasn't. Also during this time, we were coming out of a hard market. Similar to today, we reacted in advance of the industry and aggressively raised rates, such that our loss ratios were trending below our '96 combined ratio target. As such, we had available margin to fund a higher level of spend as a percentage of premium, while keeping our combined ratio below '96. Starting in 2017 and continuing for the next three years, we were able to operationalize the advances in media efficiency, which allowed us to spend significantly more while still maintaining our target economics with the increased spend funded by available margin. We went from $650 million in spend in 2016 to almost $2 billion in 2020, a tripling in just four years. You will remember from earlier slides, that during that four-year period, there was also an increase in industry spend, which I hypothesized was spurred by our increase in spend. When we started to spend more, competitors noticed and also began spending more. This resulted in that period of growth from 2017 to 2021 for the industry. While our competitors did spend more during that time, we increased our media spend much faster than the industry. Resulting in an increase in our percentage of total industry spend from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2020. To summarize, we tripled our spend in four years and almost doubled our share of the industry spend. When our losses are higher than target, we look to cut expenses with the goal of meeting our '96 combined ratio target until we have adequate rate. One of the largest and most flexible ways we can control our combined ratio is through the media budget. As severity trends rapidly steepened starting in 2021. We cut the Progressive media budget three years in a row from 2021 through 2023. Prior to this period, going back 30 years, we had never cut the budget two years in a row. So this was an unprecedented time as was the increasing size of the cuts. We went from almost $2 billion of media spend in 2020 to about $1.3 billion in 2023. These cuts happened at a time when the overall industry was cutting as well. So even with the significant cuts, the statutory data shows that we were the biggest vendor in industry in 2022 and 2023. And our share of the overall spend within the industry was almost flat. Going from 20% of spend in 2020 to 19% in 2023. All of these dynamics would have been impossible to manage without the capabilities of our in-house team. Our insights, analytics and relationships with the business allowed us to make the case for the increase in spend up to 2020 and then quickly cut significant amounts particularly in 2023 to support the overall company goal of hitting a '96. I've talked about the efficiency of our spend, but have not necessarily defined what that means. We do have a number of controls on our spend. The primary one is that our cost per sale has to be at or below our target acquisition cost. If that is the case, then we would say that the spend is beneficial. Cost per sale is our total acquisition costs divided by direct sales. Tamini is the largest part of our total acquisition costs. Other costs include the expenses related to running our call centers, development of our creative, maintaining and improving our online quote experience, the compensation of our marketing and media groups, among other things. Targeted acquisition cost is how much we charge customers for acquisition expenses over the life of their policy plus margin adequacy. It's the amount we price into the policy for acquisition. This amount is adjusted up or down based on where our margin is relative to targets. We need to make sure that the sales we are bringing in are at or below the acquisition expenses we price into our policies. That's the primary control in our spend, but there are others. Another constraint is that the direct auto lifetime combined ratio has to be at or below 96, meaning we have to be confident that that the new business we are writing in a state is going to meet our profitability target over the life of the policy. As we talked about in our second quarter 2023 Investor Relations call, direct channel policy acquisition costs are expensed in the first term of the policy and every subsequent term of the policy is collecting the premium necessary to cover the initial acquisition expense. If the acquisition expense is too high, such that the premium collected over the average lifetime does not cover initial acquisition expense, indemnity expense and other expenses, we shouldn't be spending money to acquire those policies. We need to be able to service our customers well. This is primarily for claims. There are times when the growth in the state is greater than our claims staffing can keep up with. So we will turn media off in order to slow demand and allow our staffing to catch up. Another constraint is our focus on achieving an aggregate company-wide calendar year combined ratio at or below a 96. We will not spend additional media dollars if our calendar year 96 target is under threat. Even if there may be opportunities for efficient media spend. And the final control on our spend is an efficient incremental cost per sale. That is a relatively new constraint. Incremental cost per sale is our measure of whether our spend is bringing in a quote or a sale that is over and above the ambient shopping rate. We are able to are able to measure that at a pretty granular level. And we are able to use that metric to evaluate efficiency within a channel as well as between channels. This chart shows the relativity of actual cost per sale versus the target acquisition cost. We want this metric to be at or below zero. At zero, it would mean that our actual acquisition cost is equal to our target acquisition cost. You can see that even during the run-up in spend from 2016 to 2020, that we kept cost per sale below the target in some years by as much as 15%. Even as we deployed three times the level of spend, we brought in enough sales to hit our target economics and for that extra spend to be completely paid for with the premium that was generated. 2023 was certainly an outlier given the size of the cuts. When we cut spend, we cut the least efficient areas first. After the cuts in 2023, we were left with only the most efficient spend as well as a relatively high level of ambient shopping due to the hard market. So cost per sale was significantly below the target acquisition cost in 2023. Even with a significant rise in spend 2024, the ratio has increased, but is still well below our targets. This means that so far in 2024, we are adding policies very efficiently. And this is true for two reasons. First, year-to-date, many of our competitors have remained at depressed levels of media spend. This means that we are able to get a large amount of media impressions for less. Additionally, when those impressions turn into quotes, we're converting them at a good pace, suggesting cost competitiveness. Another view of efficiency is to look at the upfront acquisition expenses as a percentage of the lifetime earned premium that is expected from the sales. From 2016 to 2020, our acquisition expenses as a percentage of premium went up, but stayed in the 7% to 7.5% range. As with the cost per sale versus target acquisition cost, this metric did fall as we made cuts in 2023 and is up in in 2024 as we've increased spend. Again, this suggests that 2024, even as we have significantly increased our media spend, we're still bringing in prospects at very high efficiency. We have shown cost per sale versus target acquisition cost in order to illustrate that even with the run-up in spend, we hit our target economics. This chart illustrates the benefit that we got from increased spend a little more clearly. This chart shows an index of media spend anchored to 2015 as a 1.0 on the horizontal axis and an index of direct auto sales anchored to 2015 on the vertical axis. Each dot represents a different year.You can see that even with the increase in spend, we were able to increase sales commensurately. As with the other charts, 2023 is an outlier. In previous calls, we were often asked about ambient shopping and how we gauge it. The 2023 number is a clear indication of the elevated amount of ambient shopping last year. Despite spending below 2019 levels, we sold more direct new policies than in any year in our history. This is because rates were rising across the industry, prompting customers to shop at and eventually purchase from Progressive. We have talked about how the budget cuts were a key tactic in helping Progressive hit the 1996 [ph] combined ratio in 2023. This chart shows acquisition expenses as a percentage of direct auto earned premium. You can see the increase in acquisition expense as a percentage of earned premium going from under 9% in in 2016 to almost 13% 2020. I had mentioned before that one of the keys to our ability to increase the spend the way that we did was available margin to be able to pay for the extra spend, while still hitting profit targets. As we reduce spend starting in 2021, the acquisition expense ratio dropped from 13% to just over 6% in 2023. This cut reduced the company-wide combined ratio by about 2.8 points in 2023 and was a big factor in our ability to exceed our 1996 calendar year target. Year-to-date 2024 we have increased spend, so now our acquisition expense ratio is back to about 10%. Note that the 2024 ratio on the chart is a year-to-date number. The first quarter acquisition expense ratio was below that of the second quarter. As margins continue to be strong, we will look for opportunities to grow the business as much as possible. While we only get statutory spend data annually, we do have some ways to gauge Progressive spend in relation to the rest of the industry during the year. There are a number of third-parties that provide a measure of what individual competitors are spending in select media channels. This chart shows an index created using iSpot data as a proxy for year-to-date TV spend and SensorTower's Pathmatics data as a proxy for year-to-date programmatic display and paid social media spend. We have set the Progressive spend at a 1.0 index and show the next four largest spenders in the insurance industry. You can see that based on this data, Progressive Media spending is considerably higher than others. Though this is only a partial picture of all the advertising done in the industry, it does provide a useful data point suggesting Progressive is outspending competitors by a significant margin. That increased spend is paying off as we are delivering the necessary sales to pay for that spend. This chart of spend versus sales is the same as the one I just showed, but each dot represents only the first half of year. You can see that 2024 is above the historic trend line with record spend and record sales. This chart suggests we are getting a strong return on our media spend to date. In conclusion, Progressive's in-house media team is a unique competitive advantage that has driven significant value for Progressive since the inception of the direct business. In the last decade, the media team has been instrumental in increasing media spend efficiently, which has resulted in greater market share. This team also plays a huge role in managing to our 1996 combined ratio through expense management and cutting spend to support the goal of a company-wide 1996 combined ratio. Today, the team is laser focused on profitable growth and is deploying record spend amounts in the first half of 2024, and this has produced the largest first half direct sales volume in our history. While we focus on the relationship between sales and media spend as a measure of efficiency, it is important to point out that many other areas of the company work in conjunction with our media team to deliver sales. Everything from the award-winning creative produced by our marketing team to industry-leading product and pricing make our jobs easier. Another key area is the team that received the online and we generate at the top of the funnel and converts it into quotes and sales. That team is the direct acquisition experience team, which has ownership of progressive.com and the online quote funnel. In the same way that the media team has evolved over decades, the acquisition experience team has been a competitive advantage for Progressive since we sold our first policy online over 25 years ago. My colleague, Dave Krew, leads that group and is going to speak to their part in the funnel. Dave?"

I'm Douglas Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.\n The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.\n Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded.\n Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event.\n Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2024. And you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.\n These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will pick us off of introductory comments. Tricia? \nSusan Griffith: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In many ways, this first quarter has felt like we have turned a page. Since mid-2021, inflationary pressure and its subsequent effect on our profit margins has been a predominant factor in our strategic decision-making. Even in the second half of 2023, when we started to see indications that severity trends were stabilizing, more rate was earning in and accident year loss ratios approached our target. We continue to flex in order to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio goal.\n In our August Investor Relations call, I was asked if we should put aside our 96 target and instead capitalize on the perceived growth opportunity at the time. In my answer, I cited our core values and the belief that our strategy to put profit before growth would prove to be a winning formula. As we look back to the second half of 2023 and the stellar results of the first quarter 2024, we feel stronger than ever that sticking to the core values that has served us well for so long was absolutely the right call. By adhering to who we are, it looks like we have turned that page and we're now seeing the benefits of the tough decisions and hard work over the last several years since inflation took off. Our first quarter of 2024 has really set the stage for us to capitalize on both growth and profitability. During the quarter, net premiums written grew 18%, and we produced a solid combined ratio of 86.1%.\n Our profitability was made possible from rate continuing to earn in from the rate revisions we took in the last year, seasonably favorable frequency. Mix changes in our book from the non-rate actions we implemented over the last 2 years continued improvements in segmentation and less prior year loss reserve development, among other factors. In Personal Auto, our calendar year margins mean we've been able to shift more focus into growth with incredible results. In the first quarter, we added over 900,000 policies in force, one of the best quarters in our history and second only to the first quarter of 2023. We did this on the back of strong retention on our renewals and new application growth that is ramping up as we increase our media spend and pull back on some of our non-rate actions.\n During the first quarter, media spend was down 7% versus the first quarter 2023, and new auto applications were down 9% compared to a record growth in the first quarter last year. The [ year to ] year gap in both spend and sales declined as the quarter progressed. When comparing March 2024 to March 2023, ad spend was up and new auto applications were nearly flat. We continue to see opportunity for growth as the market is still very tight. We have non-rate actions we are unwinding and still have a few states where we are working to get rate revisions approved.\n As we look forward to the rest of 2024, we will continue to seek to strike the right balance between efficient marketing spend, our calendar year profit targets and maximizing our growth. In Commercial Lines, the first quarter saw better results as compared to 2023. Our core commercial business continues to run well with almost 10 points of rates still to earn in from revisions in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, 90% of our policies in commercial lines are on 12-month terms, so it takes much longer for rates to earn in as compared to personal auto. The trucking insurance market continues to be soft due to macroeconomic factors. And as a result, we are experiencing year-over-year decline in policies in force in our for-hire transportation and specialty business market targets. \n While our other 3 BMTs are growing year-over-year from both a unit and premium perspective, in property, we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophe prone states, growing states that have less volatile weather profiles and improve the underwriting and segmentation of our products. Policies in force in volatile states decreased about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter 2024 and grew about 20% in the nonvolatile state. We now have 5 states on our 5.0 product model, which improves segmentation throughout the product. While results are unpredictable, we shouldn't look too deeply into the results of a single quarter as the uncertainty in the last several years has shown us, it's difficult to predict where the future is heading.\n Given what we know now, however, we're encouraged about the future. Inflationary trends are showing indications of stabilizing, and we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on a marketplace that is still reeling from the profit challenges of the last 2 years. It's comforting to be able to report that we're pivoting to a more normalized operation where, in most states, we can take small bites of the apple when it comes to rate and can focus on growth and increasing our market share. While challenges undoubtedly lay ahead, we're confident in where we stand today and look forward to maximizing our potential in the future.\n Thank you again for joining us, and I'll now take your questions. \nDouglas Constantine: This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question. \nOperator: The first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. \nJian Huang: First question is regarding retention. On your 10-Q, you talked about improved retention, both in personal lines and property business. given that you're unlikely to be the only company that is positioned for growth as we head into 2024, curious to your view on retention going forward in terms of the broader market competitive dynamics, do you see people potentially coming in challenging your market share position just going forward? And then broadly speaking, just retention in general. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. Bob, I think you know our retention is sort of our [ holy grail ] we continue to feel good about our trailing 12. Our 3 months is flat. We're going to focus now, like we said, like I just said in the opening comments on having more stable rates because that's really what consumers want. So will they go to shop, if the rate is better, then their option is to leave. We've got to make sure we have competitive rates. So as we think about growth, we just think about new business. We think about renewal business, we think about our service and growing PIF, the units of both new and renewals. So we'll continue to focus on that, focus on having more stable rates and continuing to be ahead of the competition. \nJian Huang: Okay. My follow-up is on the -- your distribution channel, and this is a little bit more hypothetical. Your direct channel, obviously have a little bit less of an underwriting margin versus your agency. As you continue to push for growth going forward, is it fair to assume that that's going to have somewhat of a headwind challenge to your overall combined ratio given your direct channel continue to be sort of a focus on the growth side? Should we expect our current underwriting margin to normalize a bit with the combination of focus on growth, your distribution channel mix and things of that nature for the personal line -- personal model? \nSusan Griffith: We're going to focus on growth in both channels. But of course, you will see the trend in the expense ratio, specifically on the direct side as we start to increase media. If you look -- if you look at January, it was around 15 points. February was 17.5, March was in the 18 area. That was -- I was putting more and more pressure as the quarter developed on the media spend. Now when we look at we look at non-acquisition expense ratios and then as much as we can spend in media as long as it's efficient. So when we look at overall combined ratios, we're going to look at, obviously, at the type of business we're bringing on. We have a preference to bring on bundled business. And we believe we have the best segmentation model in the industry.\n So that's a big part of the understanding rate to risk. So all those flow together. But we're excited and really thrilled to be able to continue -- to continue on our growth method because even the last years, with all the headwinds and all the uncertainty we've still been able to grow, but to be able to grow at these margins is really exciting. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. \nMichael Zaremski: Question on Personal Auto. Historically, not every year, but historically a disproportionate amount of Progressive's organic growth sales have come in the kind of the January through April time frame. Given the current dynamics, do you feel that that's the right type of seasonality we should be thinking about? And if not, what factors should we be thinking about? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think a lot of that comes from tax refunds and other things that happen in a yearly basis. I wouldn't necessarily think about that this year though, because even last year, we were growing, we are actually trying to kind of stop a little bit because of the pressures on our margin. I feel very bullish about our continued growth on both a premium basis -- unit basis, and that's a -- you know there is our preferred measure of growth. So it's all going to be about our ability to do a couple of things. We want to continue to roll back our nonrate actions, so there's -- we still have more levers there. We have the premium earning in and we believe that we're not going to have to -- at least at this juncture, the wide swath of premium that we had to get to our target margin and then our media spend to be able to have those margins.\n We're about 10 points better than our target 96. So we have a lot of levers to pull to be able to really maximize growth. You'll notice I said this in my letter, in my opening statements and several times throughout the 10-Q. And we talked about it as we were riding the management discussion and analysis about is maximize growth, the right word, versus optimize. And I felt maximize was absolutely the right word to use because that's exactly what we're going to do. \nMichael Zaremski: My follow-up, I know you've touched on this a bit even today and past letters, but if I just want to confirm. So if you look at the expense ratio, excluding ad expense, in 1Q of this year, it's about [ 14.1% ], which is a little bit lower than full year levels and the -- so maybe 1 quarter might not make a trend. But the LAE ratio [ 2 ] In '23, down a little bit versus the previous couple of years levels. Just wanted to confirm whether this is kind of a structural kind of efficiency run rate? Or is there kind of a cyclicality in here that could bounce those figures around? \nSusan Griffith: I mean the figures have bounced around, depending on what's happening. Clearly, we're going to want to spend more. And in March, that was on an absolute basis, the highest amount we've ever spent in media. And so we're going to spend more on that as long as it's efficient. I think you want to look at the whole spectrum of what makes up the combined ratio. So we're constantly investing to push down both loss adjustment expense and non-acquisition expense. Figuring out ways with technology, with people, with processes to reduce those expenses, because we can give those back in competitive prices, and that's really important.\n But remember, anywhere between $0.70 to $0.75 of every dollar that goes out, comes and goes out at LAE and loss. So that segmentation piece is really important, understanding our rate to risk. And I mentioned this in the first question. And I think I don't think I talk about this enough, and you get a little glimpses of it in my letters when I talk about our different product models, be it on the private passenger auto side, commercial lines and now property.\n It is really a special sauce. And it's not something that you build in a year or two. In fact, we've been building this for many decades. But about 10 years ago, we decided we needed to have continuous product model. And so we continue to do those. We started in 2014, really ramped up in 2015 and '16. So think of it as we put a couple of models out there. No state is ever more than a couple of miles behind, and we're constantly improving that segmentation. That takes a lot of investment.\n So sometimes you can see the expense ratio peak up with that. But those are built in over a decade. And I talked about the product models, but I don't probably give that enough highlight because our R&D groups and our product groups are phenomenal. They're second to none. They never rest. They continue to understand segmentation, rate to risk, and that's a lot of money that goes into the combined ratio. So while expense ratios kind of can come up and down depending on media spend, et cetera. And I don't -- obviously, we're always trying to push them down. A lot of it is the indemnification understanding accuracy and having great segmentation models. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: In your 10-Q, there was a comment about rate increases having an adverse impact on retention. And then you guys highlighted that the 3-month PLE was slowed in the quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your comments, Tricia, right, that rate increases are slowing in terms of both magnitude and frequency. So any color that you could just help us tie that 3-month PLE and impact comment about rate increases. To your overall comments just about the level of rate increase is slowing? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. Sure, Elyse. I think at this juncture in its last year so, so many customers are getting their renewal bills and the rate increases that are playing through will cause you to shop. So we're always at risk losing customers when that happens. We knew that was a possibility last year as well when we were first to market, getting the rates that we needed on the street. So while we don't know exactly what the trailing 3 will continue to be, and it's on a lagged basis, we'll obviously inform you next quarter. That's really why we feel like we're in a much better position to take those small bites and take smaller increases just to stay ahead of trend. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, on last quarter's call, when you guys were asked about advertising, you had pointed to it potentially being more even right through the Q1 and the Q2 and Q3 than normal. It sounds like that's still the plan given how positive you guys are in growth. But can you just give us a sense of how you expect the advertising spend cadence to be this year compared to historical? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, I'll start. And Pat, if you want to weigh in, you can, if there's anything to add. At this juncture with the margins that we have, we do want to use our spend levels to our advantage as long as it's efficient. So like I said, we've got a lot of other levers. We've pulled back on many non-rate actions that still have room to go on that. And I think if we can spend efficiently in the states where we believe we're adequately priced, we're going to do that, I won't' say to the full capacity, but until we feel like it's inefficient to really leverage this opportunity to maximize on growth. Pat, do you want to add anything? \nPatrick Callahan: No, no, I think that's great. Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jimmy [ Hummer ] with JPMorgan.\n The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. \nCharles Peters: So I'd like to focus the first question on the customer relationship management organization that you called out in your letter. It feels, at times, like it's almost impossible to get timely service in so many areas compared with what we were used to pre-COVID. And so I'm wondering if you could comment on the CRM piece and the challenges you're having with the growth you're reporting and finding people and making sure they're compensated appropriately? \nSusan Griffith: That's a really great question. And I should have brought that up when I think about the overall -- our goal is to grow as fast as we can, which we've been doing, $19 billion, [ $2.9 billion ] comparing quarter-over-quarter and 7% PIF growth. But the caveat always if we can support and serve our customers in the way they deserve to be supported. And that's a big caveat because, there have been times in our history where we've had to slow growth because of that. So a few years ago, we found it really challenging, both from a recruiting and a retention and a compensation perspective in our CRM organization. We made some changes in compensation about 2 years ago. We've invested a lot in the work environment and the digital capacity for our customers to be able to serve themselves should they want to.\n And we are seeing the fruits of those investments through greater tenure and better customer service. Now we are never at rest in terms of customer service. In fact, we're just working on a new customer commitment. And we need to be, frankly, fanatical about customer service because those that could call in, either they don't want to use our digital online services, which we believe are really best-in-class. So we really need some one to talk to and they need someone to answer the phone. Our  phone handling times have been really great for both sales and service. I feel -- I mean, the world of difference than 2 years ago. So I think we've done a great job staffing, training and giving them the tools they need to help our customers in the way they deserve. And that's one of the other reasons why I feel so positive about maximizing on our growth. \nCharles Peters: Maybe -- in conjunction with that, my follow-up question would be one of the common areas that we're trying to figure out is how you're investing in technology, the generative AI, the large language models, et cetera. So I don't know what you're going to be willing to share with us on that front, whether what -- how much you're spending this year versus last year? Or how you're deploying these tools to make your company more efficient. But any color on technology and the emerging options that you have available to and how you're deploying in your company would be interesting? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, absolutely. So what I would say is we have been investing well, let me step back -- Peter Lewis used to say, we are a technology company that happens to sell insurance. So everything we do has technology built into it. We have, I believe, again, a best-in-class IT organization. With that, we're always trying to stay ahead of the trends. So think of in the direct channel, think of usage-based insurance, all those things, even though they're -- they become actually a part of the product, they start with IT and our ability to have innovative technology.\n We started with machine learning and large language models probably over a decade ago, and we put a lot of those in place. So think of like we had a Chatbot that can give you documents without having a human involved. And we've continued on those and progressive.com. We've used a lot of machine learning to give you the best choice for what you need for coverage.\n Right now, we have well over 100 different models in different formats. Some are tests, some are full, full bore and summer thoughts, including many in generative  AI. We did an entire several day session with our Board of Directors a few months ago on all that we're doing in AI. And I got to tell you, it's pretty exciting. And it's exciting because the efficiencies we're going to get. I can't go into a lot of the details, but we have some great models, great tests that we're doing, and we believe it's going to be a game changer really in every single aspect of our company. So think of recruiting, think of media. And in fact, we have a Board meeting this week, and we're going to go over some AI test in media that have proven to be really successful. We lean into that technology. Clearly, you always want to think about biases and you want to have responsible AI. So we have a committee that overlooks every test that we do to make sure that we're doing it responsibly.\n But I think we're excited just like we have for the last nearly 90 years leaning into technology, I'm using it to benefit really competitive prices, so that our customers come and stay with us and we grow market share. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. \nJoshua Shanker: Obviously, the subject for the quarterly letter was growth, and the company is successfully converting on that. But there are gating factors in terms of capital. And one of the areas where you're growing is in the Robinsons, and it looks like you're picking up more homeowner property exposure than you have in the past. Can you talk about your internal capital model and how much you can grow and the extent to which capital is gating factor? Could you be 10%, 15% larger tomorrow? And still have the capital to do that without earning it. Where does that stand accurate? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I'll start and John Sauerland, you can weigh in. We are growing in one. But again, we want to grow across the board, so we'll continue that. Our property profile, as we talked about, we are rowing in what we would call growth states or more non-volatile states as far as weather, and we're shrinking I in the volatile state. So that's been a plan we put into place quite some time ago. A lot of this takes time. As I laid out last year, we're starting to see the over 100,000 homeowners policies in Florida start to non-renew that took a while because we needed to notify the customers and talk with the DOI.\n So we believe that -- that our long-term strategy has to be -- to have our portfolio sort of across the country. So when you think about capital, you have to have regulatory capital. So think of auto having a 3:1 model. So you need to -- if you write $1 billion, you have to have $300 million in capital. And then we have contingent capital in case something unforeseen happens, a big storm, financial crisis, and then we have capital even above that for that. And there's even more for home because it's more of a volatile product. I would say right now, we are in an incredibly comfortable capital position, which is another reason why I'm so excited about this growth. Do you want to add anything? \nJohn Sauerland: Sure. Yes. We are growing Robinsons more than the right now, and some of that requires our own home product, some of it doesn't. So in the direct channel, we sell a number of other competitors' home products. But for our own home product, as Tricia mentioned, we're growing a lot in non-volatile states, shrinking actually in volatile states. And when we look at our PML, so our probable maximum losses that's actually come down as a result of our shift. We also recently wrapped up our June 1 reinsurance renewals, and we are very comfortable with the risk we're taking there. And actually got slightly more competitive rates. So we feel great about that portion of our risk management program. And as Tricia noted, we have -- we're generating ample capital right now. We're growing a lot, certainly, at a $2.9 billion year-over-year in the first quarter. And of course, that requires significant but probably around $1 billion of regulatory capital. But we are generating that with underwriting margins to some degree as well year-to-date on investment returns. So we feel very comfortable with our capital level and our ability to grow as fast as we can, again, hitting those margins. \nJoshua Shanker: Thank you for all the detail. And one quick question. With the Florida policies that you're not renewing to the Loggerhead company, is that going to be significant enough that we should expect your attritional loss ratios to be higher at the end of this year, although when the added benefit of lower capacity volatility is added, they'll be lower, but on an attritional basis, will they rise? \nSusan Griffith: I couldn't really answer. I mean a lot, obviously, the first thing is first, we wanted to get off some units that we believe will not be profitable. And a lot of it, of course, from a loss perspective, depends on weather, which has really been the clincher for the last several years. And so that's why we're trying to make sure that we're just more balanced. We are still very large in Florida because we have a large auto base and we believe that we can win in Florida on both the home and auto and especially bundled, but we just need -- we were just a little bit too heavy there in addition to a couple of other states, which makes sense because ASI now Progressive Home was based and kind of grew in that area. But it's hard to think about loss ratios when I don't have sort of the crystal ball of what will happen with weather. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. \nMichael Phillips: Speaking of Florida, you mentioned some favorable frequency trends in the state and your auto book because of the total refunds. Can you share any thoughts on what you've seen on the property side because of that? \nSusan Griffith: Property side. No, we haven't seen much. Those were mostly on the auto side. [indiscernible] There's a little bit on the property, have you seen much, Pat? \nPatrick Callahan: It's too early to tell on the property side, right? We've got different statute of limitations. We've got different kind of assignment of benefits that will play through the book over time, but not as immediate as we're seeing on the auto book. \nMichael Phillips: Okay. And then you mentioned the policy life expectation has been improving month to month to month. I guess given all the dynamics in auto, maybe what's behind that? And is that harder for you to get your hands around and predict when shopping at such a high level? \nSusan Griffith: Well, we know those shopping happens when rates go up. And I think it's a little bit different, I think, depending on the demographic if you -- when you read through the 10-Q, [ Sam's ] are much more likely to be shop sensitive because they're price  sensitive. And so it's very different. When you kind of peel back the onion, you look at our different demographics as well. But we -- like I said in the last couple of calls, last year, we had seen inflationary factors like that. And so I'm not surprised that there's been a lot more shopping. And that's why the key is to get out ahead of the rate. It's short-term pain for long-term growth, and that's exactly what we did and why we're sitting in this position.\n So we're going to continue to have -- try to have stable rates. Just stay ahead of the severity trends and go from there. And I think when customers see that and then they are able to also, like I said, have great claims service, have a great service from our CRM. We want to give a reason to stay. And all the products that they can have from Progressive. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Motemaden Evercore. \nDavid Motemaden: Tricia, you had mentioned ad spend was up in March, and it was the highest amount we've ever seen or you've ever seen, but the apps were flat. So it feels like -- I know there's some lag there, but I'm sure that some of the non-rate actions are limiting conversion. Is there any way to size how much of the country still had non-rate actions in place today versus 3 months ago?\n And how you're thinking about rolling those back throughout the rest of the year? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, David, that's a great question. And one of the other things you have to compare is our extraordinary growth in quarter 1 in 2023. So that comparison is really off because we were growing a lot. We really didn't want to be a growing as much because we didn't have the margin that we wanted. But that comparison is going to be hard as well. So that's the first factor.\n We have pulled back our -- and there's a lot of levers of non-rate actions. So there's build plans, there's proof of garaging, there's a bunch of different sort of pre binding things that we do. So there's several different ones. Some we pulled back more quickly and fully. There are some states where we haven't pulled back hardly at all because we don't have the rate that we need yet. But we're working on that pretty diligently. From a percentage wise, I would say we're -- what would you say, Pat, 60% or 70%? \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. I would say, as you broke it down, on the bill plan side, we are getting close back to pre pullback. And on the verification side, it really depends at the state level, right? We still have about 20% of our states where we have media off, which is a good indication that if we have media off, we probably still have significant non-rate actions or verification in place. But we have lots of, I would say, room to run as we unwind those across both channels throughout the remainder of the year. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. And I feel like just even in the last couple of weeks or during the month of March, I feel like in some of the places where we've needed rate, we're starting to have some much more productive conversations. \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. I would agree. On the regulatory side, there's certainly -- we've had a couple of recent approvals, and we're getting more comfortable more of our calendar year premium earned in that margins continue to be we expect them to be on -- in more and more of our states. So that gives our general managers and product managers greater confidence that they should open up and write more volume because we think we're priced adequately. \nSusan Griffith: Thanks, David. \nDavid Motemaden: No, great. That's really helpful. That's encouraging to hear. And then for my follow-up question, it was good to see that Robinsons new apps up almost double digits in the first quarter. It sounded like conversion also increased on Robinsons in the agency channel. Could you maybe just talk about how you're attracting the Robinsons and how you're achieving this increased conversion and whether you're seeing any improvement on the retention of Robinsons as well? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think it's different if you're thinking about it from the agency's channel versus the direct channel on the agency channel. We continue to have our preferred agents, our platinum agents and no, we want the bundle, and they can be compensated for that. And so that is a big part of the agency channel. On the direct channel. We have our HomeQuote Explorer, where we saw Progressive Home, and I know they've been working diligently with some really great unaffiliated partners to be able to place that coverage even if it is not with Progressive Home. And we're continuing to work on having a stable group of companies in that mix.\n We -- last quarter, we went through sort of how we think about evolving with what we write on our paper and not on our paper. And we think that's good for customers to be able to have an [ album ] when they come in. So that's proven to be something that we're working diligently on, and we'll continue to work on, especially as the market, I think it's more stable. And I think the Robinsons now they come to us. I remember, years ago, John, you might remember, I remember John standing up here at an IR call and saying that, we want to be the company that when they call, they say, do you have this, we say Yes, we do. And so we're getting closer and closer to being not just a destination insurer but a destination company. So when you come and you -- or you're a Robinson, you're going to want auto home, but you're going to possibly want umbrella. You're going to want some other things. And so each added product increases retention. We don't share those. But if you look at our overall retention of the Robinsons versus the other segments, it's much higher. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Hummer (sic) [ Bhullar ] with JPMorgan. \nJamminder Bhullar: So first, I had a question just on the expense ratio. Should we assume that given how much premiums have gone up the last few years, that your expense ratio should be -- especially the non-acquisition or the sort of nondiscretionary expenses should be structurally lower for the next several years? And if that is the case, then would you let that fall to the bottom line and assume a lower combined ratio going forward? Or should we assume the deal use it to be more competitive on pricing and it will show up in the form of better growth potentially? Or gets competed away? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. Good question, Jimmy. Probably a little bit of both. So I think we'll try to continue to push expenses and we need to be efficient. And we don't necessarily though, need to be the lowest cost. We want to have low cost because that equates to competitive prices and that equates to growth. And that growth, of course, is a great cycle because that unit growth is important, especially as you've seen in the past years when severity trends go up and down because those can be less stable than having a unit growth. But yes, I think we're going to spend where we can to maximize on this growth. We're going to continue to think about expenses and utilize the investments that we make across the board to become more efficient. But a lot of it, too, and the reason we're able to do this is because of the investments we've made over the many years on technology, on people, on processes, on just our overall people and culture to be there. So I would expect that we'll be able to do a little bit of both. \nJohn Sauerland: I'd just add that we have continued to make progress on our non-acquisition expense ratio, and we've been doing so over at least the past decade. So, structurally, as you say, as we increase average premium, not only the efficiencies we plow into our business, but the denominator is a tailwind for sure. But we will always price that 96 combined ratio at the company level. So to the extent we get efficiencies, we're going to pay that back into growth and target the same margin over time. \nJamminder Bhullar: And then maybe if you could talk about the competitive environment and just competitor behavior. Overall, it seems like almost every company is still in the process of repricing its book, but I'm assuming that trends vary by state. And there are a few states where several other companies beside you are at adequate margins. So are you seeing price competition pick up in those markets? And are companies being disciplined overall? Or are you even seeing some companies maybe be a little bit too loose in terms of pricing and underwriting in areas where the loss trends have been good and states were early in allowing companies to raise prices? \nSusan Griffith: It's hard to say what other companies are doing. I can say that we still feel like it's a hard market. And we feel like we got ahead of the curve as far as pricing. We're seeing that with our growth, and I hope to continue to see that. I think if you follow, which I'm sure you do, the competition, margins look good. And so I think everyone saw what we saw in terms of trends and reacted. Again, you have a certain period of time where if you react more quickly, you have an advantage, and that advantage sort of begets growth and sort of is like -- I feel like at this juncture, last year when I talked about it in November about starting to think about pulling back some non-rate actions and doing some things as like we kind of put our toe in the water and everybody else wasn't quite there. We then -- we put our whole foot and we set the edge of the pool, and now we're diving in.\n So I think we feel really great about our ability to grow. People will catch up. That's this industry. It's an ebb and flow of soft markets, hard markets, and it's just about getting out ahead of it. And again, I can't stress enough how much segmentation and our ability to match rate to risk matters. And to not ever rust and say, okay, we've got whatever, [ 8.8, 5.04 ]. We were very creative in our model naming. But the bottom line is, is constant, and we don't put one in and say, okay, we'll wait for 10 years and see how that works. And they -- and the interactions with our different variables with each other are so important. So that's a big piece of it as well. So it's about having the right [ rate ] on the street, of course, that's table stakes. So it's also about having product models where you really understand the ultimate loss costs. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Meyer Sheilds with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Great. When we look at year-over-year policy count growth in personal lines, we saw a pickup in direct, but modest sequential slowdown in agency. And I was hoping you could -- sorry, in March, I was hoping you could translate what actually is going on like why we're seeing that sort of different trends? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. I think if you -- I think agency in March was more flat. I think you'll see that a little bit -- it will be a little bit more delayed than direct, where we have more access to put on the media spend, whereas I think agents -- it's just a different model. Pat, you can add one of that. But if I recall, March started to be a little bit -- the trend started to return a little bit in agency. \nPatrick Callahan: Yes. So we've been slower to open things back up in the agency channel and specifically things like returning rates on comparative raters across the board, which, thus, put our rate in a more competitive position and potentially drive more growth. But know that we are leaning into that at this point. And as we're more confident in our rate adequacy we are opening up some of those non-rate actions in the agency channel. We have fewer top-of-funnel levers in the agency channel. It's more mid-funnel. So you will see that delayed effect when, media, we can fill the top of the funnel on the direct channel much more responsibly and quickly when we decide we're rate adequate. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And to response your comments earlier, would it make sense to have more 6-month policies in commercial lines? \nSusan Griffith: We've talked about that for years. And I think what I would say it's very dependent on the BMT. When you go in to get a quote and ultimately convert, there are some business marketing tiers that are really complex and time-consuming. And you're gathering information, and it's not an easy process. You don't want to do that every 6 months. So with those, you just have to be priced right and have the ability to do things like debits and credits. To get things right more quickly.\n We have [indiscernible] and we had a lot in the past. And we continue to think about that. I know Karen and your team are thinking about that in some of the BMTs that could be more flexible. That said, I'm super excited, and I'm glad you brought up commercial. I'm super excited to talk about commercial. I feel like we're in a great position. We still have 10 points to earn in, the rest of this calendar year. Again, the key was getting out in front of it, and it's especially important because of those 12-month policies. But one of the things that we did many, many years ago, and I think this might have been the first IR call or maybe in the first year or so after I took over. When team and I develop -- we hadn't developed the horizon concept that came from McKinsey, but we developed how we were going to think about growing the company. And on commercial lines is a big part of that. They were already in Horizon 1 with commercial lodging the #1 writer. But in Horizon 2, we wanted to do is really understand adjacent products that we could develop. And they really mostly within the Commercial Lines organization. \n So if you think of small fleets, that has tripled business over the last 5 years. You saw that we're now in Florida, we have BOP in 45 states. The new product [ files ] I've been talking about on the private passenger, auto side or also on the commercial side. And our business model contractor, right now, just recently in the last several weeks, we've seeing new app volume have new all-time highs. And as importantly, the take rate for ProView, which is the usage-based insurance, I think snapshot for the business auto contractor customers has doubled.\n So really excited about the growth and the different levers because of such a variety of types of products in the Commercial line organization. And what we'll do is we'll look at those and see, is there an opportunity to have more on 6 months, what does that mean to your retention? What does that mean to conversion, et cetera. So we'll test some of those things likely in the next year or so. But I am excited. And even when you think about FHT, we've been talking a lot about macroeconomic trends. When you go back pre-pandemic. And then of course, we were set. We knew that market really well. We leveraged and capitalized on the fact that the trucking industry exploded because people were moving goods across the country, spot rates were high. And now that we're sort of a little bit back to normal. What we're seeing is when we look at Federal Motor Carrier authorizations, we -- they're off a certain amount, we're actually up higher than that on new business with FHT. So I'm going to -- it's hard to not compare the pandemic and subsequently what happened. But what we're really trying to look at is how does growth compare to 2019? And what I would say with FHT, the For Hire Transportation, it looks good. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. \nMichael Ward: I was wondering about Telematics. We noticed adoption was down, I think, 20% in agency. I think you said because of the mix of agencies, just hoping you could help us understand why that is? Is Telematics more specific to certain customer segmentations or geographies? Maybe Robinson just aren't as bigger adopters of it. \nSusan Griffith: Yes. Mark, that was mostly a couple of big national account agencies. That started happening maybe around mid-2023. So nothing much to read into. We're still really excited. In fact, take rate and agency really has peaked up since prepandemic. And so we continue to believe that's a big part of our model. We have 57 billion miles driven. So we have a lot of data, 7 billion trips. So we continue to have that be a big part of it. And we're constantly talking to agents about the importance of that to get those great drivers, great discounts. \nMichael Ward: Okay. And then maybe just on recent loss experience. We've seen accident frequency ticked down high single digits into last 2 consecutive quarters. Just wondering if you could share your view on maybe what's driving that? Is it mix? And I guess or mild winter? And what are you seeing more recently? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, that's good. And those are 2 of the variables for sure. So the mile-to-mile quarter helped our mix of business, our sort of self-imposed underwriting actions. And actually, we have seen a tailwind from [ House billing 37 ]. So those would probably be 4 of the contributing factors. What I would look at instead of focusing on the quarter, that would be, I would look at the trailing 12 over prior frequency because those were some factors in this quarter for sure. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Just following up on the frequency questions. I'm just curious, do you think changes in all terms and conditions or customers maybe raising deductibles or anything is causing the benefit of frequency right now. I think we've seen that in prior kind of cycles like we're in right now? \nSusan Griffith: It's so hard to discern that. We've been playing around and there could be -- and maybe Mark brought it up a little bit. There could be a little bit of regional differences in terms of frequencies no fault state versus none. It's hard to really pinpoint that. We're going to continue to work on that. But it really is hard to pinpoint those exact things from frequency. So really, what I said before, what we're seeing at least in that first quarter is really our self-imposed underwriting restrictions, some mix difference, which makes sense and then some weather and some changes from the Florida House bill. Those are the parts that we can better quantify. \nBrian Meredith: Right. So you're not pricing for it basically? \nSusan Griffith: We look at it and we price for frequency and severity, but we can't predict frequency. We know when we see it. \nBrian Meredith: Great. And then my second question, just curious, getting into the smart commercial business, obviously, the homeowners. Can you talk a little bit, do you have or are you thinking about E&S capabilities? And would that be an area into and we get more from the full package business and you have it in the other side? \nSusan Griffith: I'm really sorry, but you broke out completely there. We didn't understand the question. \nBrian Meredith: Sorry, can you hear me now? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, perfect. \nBrian Meredith: I was asking more about E&S capabilities in maybe homeowners or commercial or plans to have some of those excess and surplus line capabilities. just given the regulatory and risk landscape out there? \nSusan Griffith: Yes, those are things to think about all the time we have. We actually utilize the E&S capabilities in some venues in commercial already. And we always look at kind of the best way to understand if we can't get the rate we need in the admitted market, and we have an opportunity and an ability to do that should that arise. \nOperator: The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. \nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Wanted to start with a couple of mix shifts and the potential impact, if we can. And then maybe we start with the Robinsons. Would the  greater weighting of Robinsons ultimately also lead to greater exposure in bodily injury, where I think severity trends remain a bit higher? And if so, how do you address that or price for that keep the profit targets in line with where you want them to be? \nSusan Griffith: Yes. We priced like John was saying, every customer, every state or channel to a lifetime 96 knowing that the limit difference different if you're a preferred if you're going to have higher limits. So we price for that and are very clear on -- and reserved for that. And so that's sort of our secret sauce as well. \nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then if we switch to commercial. So historically, if I look at Progressive, I think the company has been able to avoid a lot of the severity pressures that have been that the industry has seen in commercial auto. And I think a lot of that has to do, obviously, with your underwriting and segmentation, but also because you had a small trucking orientation. But now that post the protective acquisition and with the growth in the TNC business, do you see this, I guess, severity trends different in the overall commercial auto book than they had been in the past? And how are you managing those? \nSusan Griffith: I mean commercial is very much -- I mean all of our businesses state-by-state, but commercial has a few states that are much more volatile, and we have to price for those or like Karen's doing now and actually Pat on the PL side is a lot of business restrictions until we can get the prices we need and non-rate actions. But I think, like I said, when I was outlining the variety of BMTs, they react very differently and exposure very differently, and we treat them differently in terms of the segmentation perspective. You mentioned TNC. We needed a huge increase with one of our partners there, and we're able to get that. So our comfort level of success in the TNC organizations is very high now. We feel good about that.\n But yes, the exposure is different. You just have to stay on top of it from a pricing perspective and from a claims perspective. \nDouglas Constantine: Those in the queue appear to be those who've already asked questions. So that concludes our event.\n Those left in the queue can direct your questions directly to me via e-mail or my direct phone line. Tia, I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts. \nOperator: That concludes the Progressive Corporation's First Quarter Investor event. Information about a replay of the event will be available on the Investor Relations section of Progressive's website for the next year.",

            "name": "Patrick Callahan",
            "content": "No, no, I think that's great. Thanks. It's too early to tell on the property side, right? We've got different statute of limitations. We've got different kind of assignment of benefits that will play through the book over time, but not as immediate as we're seeing on the auto book. Yes. I would say, as you broke it down, on the bill plan side, we are getting close back to pre pullback. And on the verification side, it really depends at the state level, right? We still have about 20% of our states where we have media off, which is a good indication that if we have media off, we probably still have significant non-rate actions or verification in place. But we have lots of, I would say, room to run as we unwind those across both channels throughout the remainder of the year. Yes. I would agree. On the regulatory side, there's certainly -- we've had a couple of recent approvals, and we're getting more comfortable more of our calendar year premium earned in that margins continue to be we expect them to be on -- in more and more of our states. So that gives our general managers and product managers greater confidence that they should open up and write more volume because we think we're priced adequately. Yes.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Sauerland",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. We are growing Robinsons more than the right now, and some of that requires our own home product, some of it doesn't. So in the direct channel, we sell a number of other competitors' home products. But for our own home product, as Tricia mentioned, we're growing a lot in non-volatile states, shrinking actually in volatile states. And when we look at our PML, so our probable maximum losses that's actually come down as a result of our shift. We also recently wrapped up our June 1 reinsurance renewals, and we are very comfortable with the risk we're taking there. And actually got slightly more competitive rates. So we feel great about that portion of our risk management program. And as Tricia noted, we have -- we're generating ample capital right now. We're growing a lot, certainly, at a $2.9 billion year-over-year in the first quarter. And of course, that requires significant but probably around $1 billion of regulatory capital. But we are generating that with underwriting margins to some degree as well year-to-date on investment returns. So we feel very comfortable with our capital level and our ability to grow as fast as we can, again, hitting those margins. I'd just add that we have continued to make progress on our non-acquisition expense ratio, and we've been doing so over at least the past decade. So, structurally, as you say, as we increase average premium, not only the efficiencies we plow into our business, but the denominator is a tailwind for sure. But we will always price that 96 combined ratio at the company level. So to the extent we get efficiencies, we're going to pay that back into growth and target the same margin over time."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Susan Griffith",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In many ways, this first quarter has felt like we have turned a page. Since mid-2021, inflationary pressure and its subsequent effect on our profit margins has been a predominant factor in our strategic decision-making. Even in the second half of 2023, when we started to see indications that severity trends were stabilizing, more rate was earning in and accident year loss ratios approached our target. We continue to flex in order to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio goal.\n In our August Investor Relations call, I was asked if we should put aside our 96 target and instead capitalize on the perceived growth opportunity at the time. In my answer, I cited our core values and the belief that our strategy to put profit before growth would prove to be a winning formula. As we look back to the second half of 2023 and the stellar results of the first quarter 2024, we feel stronger than ever that sticking to the core values that has served us well for so long was absolutely the right call. By adhering to who we are, it looks like we have turned that page and we're now seeing the benefits of the tough decisions and hard work over the last several years since inflation took off. Our first quarter of 2024 has really set the stage for us to capitalize on both growth and profitability. During the quarter, net premiums written grew 18%, and we produced a solid combined ratio of 86.1%.\n Our profitability was made possible from rate continuing to earn in from the rate revisions we took in the last year, seasonably favorable frequency. Mix changes in our book from the non-rate actions we implemented over the last 2 years continued improvements in segmentation and less prior year loss reserve development, among other factors. In Personal Auto, our calendar year margins mean we've been able to shift more focus into growth with incredible results. In the first quarter, we added over 900,000 policies in force, one of the best quarters in our history and second only to the first quarter of 2023. We did this on the back of strong retention on our renewals and new application growth that is ramping up as we increase our media spend and pull back on some of our non-rate actions.\n During the first quarter, media spend was down 7% versus the first quarter 2023, and new auto applications were down 9% compared to a record growth in the first quarter last year. The [ year to ] year gap in both spend and sales declined as the quarter progressed. When comparing March 2024 to March 2023, ad spend was up and new auto applications were nearly flat. We continue to see opportunity for growth as the market is still very tight. We have non-rate actions we are unwinding and still have a few states where we are working to get rate revisions approved.\n As we look forward to the rest of 2024, we will continue to seek to strike the right balance between efficient marketing spend, our calendar year profit targets and maximizing our growth. In Commercial Lines, the first quarter saw better results as compared to 2023. Our core commercial business continues to run well with almost 10 points of rates still to earn in from revisions in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, 90% of our policies in commercial lines are on 12-month terms, so it takes much longer for rates to earn in as compared to personal auto. The trucking insurance market continues to be soft due to macroeconomic factors. And as a result, we are experiencing year-over-year decline in policies in force in our for-hire transportation and specialty business market targets. \n While our other 3 BMTs are growing year-over-year from both a unit and premium perspective, in property, we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophe prone states, growing states that have less volatile weather profiles and improve the underwriting and segmentation of our products. Policies in force in volatile states decreased about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter 2024 and grew about 20% in the nonvolatile state. We now have 5 states on our 5.0 product model, which improves segmentation throughout the product. While results are unpredictable, we shouldn't look too deeply into the results of a single quarter as the uncertainty in the last several years has shown us, it's difficult to predict where the future is heading.\n Given what we know now, however, we're encouraged about the future. Inflationary trends are showing indications of stabilizing, and we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on a marketplace that is still reeling from the profit challenges of the last 2 years. It's comforting to be able to report that we're pivoting to a more normalized operation where, in most states, we can take small bites of the apple when it comes to rate and can focus on growth and increasing our market share. While challenges undoubtedly lay ahead, we're confident in where we stand today and look forward to maximizing our potential in the future.\n Thank you again for joining us, and I'll now take your questions. Yes. Bob, I think you know our retention is sort of our [ holy grail ] we continue to feel good about our trailing 12. Our 3 months is flat. We're going to focus now, like we said, like I just said in the opening comments on having more stable rates because that's really what consumers want. So will they go to shop, if the rate is better, then their option is to leave. We've got to make sure we have competitive rates. So as we think about growth, we just think about new business. We think about renewal business, we think about our service and growing PIF, the units of both new and renewals. So we'll continue to focus on that, focus on having more stable rates and continuing to be ahead of the competition. We're going to focus on growth in both channels. But of course, you will see the trend in the expense ratio, specifically on the direct side as we start to increase media. If you look -- if you look at January, it was around 15 points. February was 17.5, March was in the 18 area. That was -- I was putting more and more pressure as the quarter developed on the media spend. Now when we look at we look at non-acquisition expense ratios and then as much as we can spend in media as long as it's efficient. So when we look at overall combined ratios, we're going to look at, obviously, at the type of business we're bringing on. We have a preference to bring on bundled business. And we believe we have the best segmentation model in the industry.\n So that's a big part of the understanding rate to risk. So all those flow together. But we're excited and really thrilled to be able to continue -- to continue on our growth method because even the last years, with all the headwinds and all the uncertainty we've still been able to grow, but to be able to grow at these margins is really exciting. Yes. I think a lot of that comes from tax refunds and other things that happen in a yearly basis. I wouldn't necessarily think about that this year though, because even last year, we were growing, we are actually trying to kind of stop a little bit because of the pressures on our margin. I feel very bullish about our continued growth on both a premium basis -- unit basis, and that's a -- you know there is our preferred measure of growth. So it's all going to be about our ability to do a couple of things. We want to continue to roll back our nonrate actions, so there's -- we still have more levers there. We have the premium earning in and we believe that we're not going to have to -- at least at this juncture, the wide swath of premium that we had to get to our target margin and then our media spend to be able to have those margins.\n We're about 10 points better than our target 96. So we have a lot of levers to pull to be able to really maximize growth. You'll notice I said this in my letter, in my opening statements and several times throughout the 10-Q. And we talked about it as we were riding the management discussion and analysis about is maximize growth, the right word, versus optimize. And I felt maximize was absolutely the right word to use because that's exactly what we're going to do. I mean the figures have bounced around, depending on what's happening. Clearly, we're going to want to spend more. And in March, that was on an absolute basis, the highest amount we've ever spent in media. And so we're going to spend more on that as long as it's efficient. I think you want to look at the whole spectrum of what makes up the combined ratio. So we're constantly investing to push down both loss adjustment expense and non-acquisition expense. Figuring out ways with technology, with people, with processes to reduce those expenses, because we can give those back in competitive prices, and that's really important.\n But remember, anywhere between $0.70 to $0.75 of every dollar that goes out, comes and goes out at LAE and loss. So that segmentation piece is really important, understanding our rate to risk. And I mentioned this in the first question. And I think I don't think I talk about this enough, and you get a little glimpses of it in my letters when I talk about our different product models, be it on the private passenger auto side, commercial lines and now property.\n It is really a special sauce. And it's not something that you build in a year or two. In fact, we've been building this for many decades. But about 10 years ago, we decided we needed to have continuous product model. And so we continue to do those. We started in 2014, really ramped up in 2015 and '16. So think of it as we put a couple of models out there. No state is ever more than a couple of miles behind, and we're constantly improving that segmentation. That takes a lot of investment.\n So sometimes you can see the expense ratio peak up with that. But those are built in over a decade. And I talked about the product models, but I don't probably give that enough highlight because our R&D groups and our product groups are phenomenal. They're second to none. They never rest. They continue to understand segmentation, rate to risk, and that's a lot of money that goes into the combined ratio. So while expense ratios kind of can come up and down depending on media spend, et cetera. And I don't -- obviously, we're always trying to push them down. A lot of it is the indemnification understanding accuracy and having great segmentation models. Yes. Sure, Elyse. I think at this juncture in its last year so, so many customers are getting their renewal bills and the rate increases that are playing through will cause you to shop. So we're always at risk losing customers when that happens. We knew that was a possibility last year as well when we were first to market, getting the rates that we needed on the street. So while we don't know exactly what the trailing 3 will continue to be, and it's on a lagged basis, we'll obviously inform you next quarter. That's really why we feel like we're in a much better position to take those small bites and take smaller increases just to stay ahead of trend. Yes, I'll start. And Pat, if you want to weigh in, you can, if there's anything to add. At this juncture with the margins that we have, we do want to use our spend levels to our advantage as long as it's efficient. So like I said, we've got a lot of other levers. We've pulled back on many non-rate actions that still have room to go on that. And I think if we can spend efficiently in the states where we believe we're adequately priced, we're going to do that, I won't' say to the full capacity, but until we feel like it's inefficient to really leverage this opportunity to maximize on growth. Pat, do you want to add anything? That's a really great question. And I should have brought that up when I think about the overall -- our goal is to grow as fast as we can, which we've been doing, $19 billion, [ $2.9 billion ] comparing quarter-over-quarter and 7% PIF growth. But the caveat always if we can support and serve our customers in the way they deserve to be supported. And that's a big caveat because, there have been times in our history where we've had to slow growth because of that. So a few years ago, we found it really challenging, both from a recruiting and a retention and a compensation perspective in our CRM organization. We made some changes in compensation about 2 years ago. We've invested a lot in the work environment and the digital capacity for our customers to be able to serve themselves should they want to.\n And we are seeing the fruits of those investments through greater tenure and better customer service. Now we are never at rest in terms of customer service. In fact, we're just working on a new customer commitment. And we need to be, frankly, fanatical about customer service because those that could call in, either they don't want to use our digital online services, which we believe are really best-in-class. So we really need some one to talk to and they need someone to answer the phone. Our  phone handling times have been really great for both sales and service. I feel -- I mean, the world of difference than 2 years ago. So I think we've done a great job staffing, training and giving them the tools they need to help our customers in the way they deserve. And that's one of the other reasons why I feel so positive about maximizing on our growth. Yes, absolutely. So what I would say is we have been investing well, let me step back -- Peter Lewis used to say, we are a technology company that happens to sell insurance. So everything we do has technology built into it. We have, I believe, again, a best-in-class IT organization. With that, we're always trying to stay ahead of the trends. So think of in the direct channel, think of usage-based insurance, all those things, even though they're -- they become actually a part of the product, they start with IT and our ability to have innovative technology.\n We started with machine learning and large language models probably over a decade ago, and we put a lot of those in place. So think of like we had a Chatbot that can give you documents without having a human involved. And we've continued on those and progressive.com. We've used a lot of machine learning to give you the best choice for what you need for coverage.\n Right now, we have well over 100 different models in different formats. Some are tests, some are full, full bore and summer thoughts, including many in generative  AI. We did an entire several day session with our Board of Directors a few months ago on all that we're doing in AI. And I got to tell you, it's pretty exciting. And it's exciting because the efficiencies we're going to get. I can't go into a lot of the details, but we have some great models, great tests that we're doing, and we believe it's going to be a game changer really in every single aspect of our company. So think of recruiting, think of media. And in fact, we have a Board meeting this week, and we're going to go over some AI test in media that have proven to be really successful. We lean into that technology. Clearly, you always want to think about biases and you want to have responsible AI. So we have a committee that overlooks every test that we do to make sure that we're doing it responsibly.\n But I think we're excited just like we have for the last nearly 90 years leaning into technology, I'm using it to benefit really competitive prices, so that our customers come and stay with us and we grow market share. Yes. I'll start and John Sauerland, you can weigh in. We are growing in one. But again, we want to grow across the board, so we'll continue that. Our property profile, as we talked about, we are rowing in what we would call growth states or more non-volatile states as far as weather, and we're shrinking I in the volatile state. So that's been a plan we put into place quite some time ago. A lot of this takes time. As I laid out last year, we're starting to see the over 100,000 homeowners policies in Florida start to non-renew that took a while because we needed to notify the customers and talk with the DOI.\n So we believe that -- that our long-term strategy has to be -- to have our portfolio sort of across the country. So when you think about capital, you have to have regulatory capital. So think of auto having a 3:1 model. So you need to -- if you write $1 billion, you have to have $300 million in capital. And then we have contingent capital in case something unforeseen happens, a big storm, financial crisis, and then we have capital even above that for that. And there's even more for home because it's more of a volatile product. I would say right now, we are in an incredibly comfortable capital position, which is another reason why I'm so excited about this growth. Do you want to add anything? I couldn't really answer. I mean a lot, obviously, the first thing is first, we wanted to get off some units that we believe will not be profitable. And a lot of it, of course, from a loss perspective, depends on weather, which has really been the clincher for the last several years. And so that's why we're trying to make sure that we're just more balanced. We are still very large in Florida because we have a large auto base and we believe that we can win in Florida on both the home and auto and especially bundled, but we just need -- we were just a little bit too heavy there in addition to a couple of other states, which makes sense because ASI now Progressive Home was based and kind of grew in that area. But it's hard to think about loss ratios when I don't have sort of the crystal ball of what will happen with weather. Property side. No, we haven't seen much. Those were mostly on the auto side. [indiscernible] There's a little bit on the property, have you seen much, Pat? Well, we know those shopping happens when rates go up. And I think it's a little bit different, I think, depending on the demographic if you -- when you read through the 10-Q, [ Sam's ] are much more likely to be shop sensitive because they're price  sensitive. And so it's very different. When you kind of peel back the onion, you look at our different demographics as well. But we -- like I said in the last couple of calls, last year, we had seen inflationary factors like that. And so I'm not surprised that there's been a lot more shopping. And that's why the key is to get out ahead of the rate. It's short-term pain for long-term growth, and that's exactly what we did and why we're sitting in this position.\n So we're going to continue to have -- try to have stable rates. Just stay ahead of the severity trends and go from there. And I think when customers see that and then they are able to also, like I said, have great claims service, have a great service from our CRM. We want to give a reason to stay. And all the products that they can have from Progressive. Yes, David, that's a great question. And one of the other things you have to compare is our extraordinary growth in quarter 1 in 2023. So that comparison is really off because we were growing a lot. We really didn't want to be a growing as much because we didn't have the margin that we wanted. But that comparison is going to be hard as well. So that's the first factor.\n We have pulled back our -- and there's a lot of levers of non-rate actions. So there's build plans, there's proof of garaging, there's a bunch of different sort of pre binding things that we do. So there's several different ones. Some we pulled back more quickly and fully. There are some states where we haven't pulled back hardly at all because we don't have the rate that we need yet. But we're working on that pretty diligently. From a percentage wise, I would say we're -- what would you say, Pat, 60% or 70%? Yes. And I feel like just even in the last couple of weeks or during the month of March, I feel like in some of the places where we've needed rate, we're starting to have some much more productive conversations. Thanks, David. Yes. I think it's different if you're thinking about it from the agency's channel versus the direct channel on the agency channel. We continue to have our preferred agents, our platinum agents and no, we want the bundle, and they can be compensated for that. And so that is a big part of the agency channel. On the direct channel. We have our HomeQuote Explorer, where we saw Progressive Home, and I know they've been working diligently with some really great unaffiliated partners to be able to place that coverage even if it is not with Progressive Home. And we're continuing to work on having a stable group of companies in that mix.\n We -- last quarter, we went through sort of how we think about evolving with what we write on our paper and not on our paper. And we think that's good for customers to be able to have an [ album ] when they come in. So that's proven to be something that we're working diligently on, and we'll continue to work on, especially as the market, I think it's more stable. And I think the Robinsons now they come to us. I remember, years ago, John, you might remember, I remember John standing up here at an IR call and saying that, we want to be the company that when they call, they say, do you have this, we say Yes, we do. And so we're getting closer and closer to being not just a destination insurer but a destination company. So when you come and you -- or you're a Robinson, you're going to want auto home, but you're going to possibly want umbrella. You're going to want some other things. And so each added product increases retention. We don't share those. But if you look at our overall retention of the Robinsons versus the other segments, it's much higher. Yes. Good question, Jimmy. Probably a little bit of both. So I think we'll try to continue to push expenses and we need to be efficient. And we don't necessarily though, need to be the lowest cost. We want to have low cost because that equates to competitive prices and that equates to growth. And that growth, of course, is a great cycle because that unit growth is important, especially as you've seen in the past years when severity trends go up and down because those can be less stable than having a unit growth. But yes, I think we're going to spend where we can to maximize on this growth. We're going to continue to think about expenses and utilize the investments that we make across the board to become more efficient. But a lot of it, too, and the reason we're able to do this is because of the investments we've made over the many years on technology, on people, on processes, on just our overall people and culture to be there. So I would expect that we'll be able to do a little bit of both. It's hard to say what other companies are doing. I can say that we still feel like it's a hard market. And we feel like we got ahead of the curve as far as pricing. We're seeing that with our growth, and I hope to continue to see that. I think if you follow, which I'm sure you do, the competition, margins look good. And so I think everyone saw what we saw in terms of trends and reacted. Again, you have a certain period of time where if you react more quickly, you have an advantage, and that advantage sort of begets growth and sort of is like -- I feel like at this juncture, last year when I talked about it in November about starting to think about pulling back some non-rate actions and doing some things as like we kind of put our toe in the water and everybody else wasn't quite there. We then -- we put our whole foot and we set the edge of the pool, and now we're diving in.\n So I think we feel really great about our ability to grow. People will catch up. That's this industry. It's an ebb and flow of soft markets, hard markets, and it's just about getting out ahead of it. And again, I can't stress enough how much segmentation and our ability to match rate to risk matters. And to not ever rust and say, okay, we've got whatever, [ 8.8, 5.04 ]. We were very creative in our model naming. But the bottom line is, is constant, and we don't put one in and say, okay, we'll wait for 10 years and see how that works. And they -- and the interactions with our different variables with each other are so important. So that's a big piece of it as well. So it's about having the right [ rate ] on the street, of course, that's table stakes. So it's also about having product models where you really understand the ultimate loss costs. Yes. I think if you -- I think agency in March was more flat. I think you'll see that a little bit -- it will be a little bit more delayed than direct, where we have more access to put on the media spend, whereas I think agents -- it's just a different model. Pat, you can add one of that. But if I recall, March started to be a little bit -- the trend started to return a little bit in agency. We've talked about that for years. And I think what I would say it's very dependent on the BMT. When you go in to get a quote and ultimately convert, there are some business marketing tiers that are really complex and time-consuming. And you're gathering information, and it's not an easy process. You don't want to do that every 6 months. So with those, you just have to be priced right and have the ability to do things like debits and credits. To get things right more quickly.\n We have [indiscernible] and we had a lot in the past. And we continue to think about that. I know Karen and your team are thinking about that in some of the BMTs that could be more flexible. That said, I'm super excited, and I'm glad you brought up commercial. I'm super excited to talk about commercial. I feel like we're in a great position. We still have 10 points to earn in, the rest of this calendar year. Again, the key was getting out in front of it, and it's especially important because of those 12-month policies. But one of the things that we did many, many years ago, and I think this might have been the first IR call or maybe in the first year or so after I took over. When team and I develop -- we hadn't developed the horizon concept that came from McKinsey, but we developed how we were going to think about growing the company. And on commercial lines is a big part of that. They were already in Horizon 1 with commercial lodging the #1 writer. But in Horizon 2, we wanted to do is really understand adjacent products that we could develop. And they really mostly within the Commercial Lines organization. \n So if you think of small fleets, that has tripled business over the last 5 years. You saw that we're now in Florida, we have BOP in 45 states. The new product [ files ] I've been talking about on the private passenger, auto side or also on the commercial side. And our business model contractor, right now, just recently in the last several weeks, we've seeing new app volume have new all-time highs. And as importantly, the take rate for ProView, which is the usage-based insurance, I think snapshot for the business auto contractor customers has doubled.\n So really excited about the growth and the different levers because of such a variety of types of products in the Commercial line organization. And what we'll do is we'll look at those and see, is there an opportunity to have more on 6 months, what does that mean to your retention? What does that mean to conversion, et cetera. So we'll test some of those things likely in the next year or so. But I am excited. And even when you think about FHT, we've been talking a lot about macroeconomic trends. When you go back pre-pandemic. And then of course, we were set. We knew that market really well. We leveraged and capitalized on the fact that the trucking industry exploded because people were moving goods across the country, spot rates were high. And now that we're sort of a little bit back to normal. What we're seeing is when we look at Federal Motor Carrier authorizations, we -- they're off a certain amount, we're actually up higher than that on new business with FHT. So I'm going to -- it's hard to not compare the pandemic and subsequently what happened. But what we're really trying to look at is how does growth compare to 2019? And what I would say with FHT, the For Hire Transportation, it looks good. Yes. Mark, that was mostly a couple of big national account agencies. That started happening maybe around mid-2023. So nothing much to read into. We're still really excited. In fact, take rate and agency really has peaked up since prepandemic. And so we continue to believe that's a big part of our model. We have 57 billion miles driven. So we have a lot of data, 7 billion trips. So we continue to have that be a big part of it. And we're constantly talking to agents about the importance of that to get those great drivers, great discounts. Yes, that's good. And those are 2 of the variables for sure. So the mile-to-mile quarter helped our mix of business, our sort of self-imposed underwriting actions. And actually, we have seen a tailwind from [ House billing 37 ]. So those would probably be 4 of the contributing factors. What I would look at instead of focusing on the quarter, that would be, I would look at the trailing 12 over prior frequency because those were some factors in this quarter for sure. It's so hard to discern that. We've been playing around and there could be -- and maybe Mark brought it up a little bit. There could be a little bit of regional differences in terms of frequencies no fault state versus none. It's hard to really pinpoint that. We're going to continue to work on that. But it really is hard to pinpoint those exact things from frequency. So really, what I said before, what we're seeing at least in that first quarter is really our self-imposed underwriting restrictions, some mix difference, which makes sense and then some weather and some changes from the Florida House bill. Those are the parts that we can better quantify. We look at it and we price for frequency and severity, but we can't predict frequency. We know when we see it. I'm really sorry, but you broke out completely there. We didn't understand the question. Yes, perfect. Yes, those are things to think about all the time we have. We actually utilize the E&S capabilities in some venues in commercial already. And we always look at kind of the best way to understand if we can't get the rate we need in the admitted market, and we have an opportunity and an ability to do that should that arise. Yes. We priced like John was saying, every customer, every state or channel to a lifetime 96 knowing that the limit difference different if you're a preferred if you're going to have higher limits. So we price for that and are very clear on -- and reserved for that. And so that's sort of our secret sauce as well. I mean commercial is very much -- I mean all of our businesses state-by-state, but commercial has a few states that are much more volatile, and we have to price for those or like Karen's doing now and actually Pat on the PL side is a lot of business restrictions until we can get the prices we need and non-rate actions. But I think, like I said, when I was outlining the variety of BMTs, they react very differently and exposure very differently, and we treat them differently in terms of the segmentation perspective. You mentioned TNC. We needed a huge increase with one of our partners there, and we're able to get that. So our comfort level of success in the TNC organizations is very high now. We feel good about that.\n But yes, the exposure is different. You just have to stay on top of it from a pricing perspective and from a claims perspective."
